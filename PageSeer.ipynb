And happiest of all for me -- the sections on Northeast Iowa -- the tree-laden hills, the valleys, the Mississippi River - are full of Accurate Information! Which I'm so happy to find after years of looking through books that misrepresent us of the Driftless corner of the state. Mike Whye did his homework.

Particularly good if you are interested in natural beauty, outdoors recreation, and historical sites -- highlights the diverse enjoyments of Iowa."

It contains detailed maps of 27 auto tours \"away from the interstates\" in Iowa - into what I would call the \"real Iowa\" This book contains sites along each tour. And happiest of all for me -- the sections on Northeast Iowa -- the tree-laden hills, the valleys, the Mississippi River - are full of Accurate Information! Which I'm so happy to find after years of looking through books that misrepresent us of the Driftless corner of the state. Mike Whye did his homework. If you want to see the real Iowa take a look in this book for ideas. Particularly good if you are interested in natural beauty, outdoors recreation, and historical sites -- highlights the diverse enjoyments of Iowa."

         "Night And Day",
         "I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was thin, action almost nonexistent--not much to it. Definitely not your typical, entertaining Robert B. Parker book. Let's face facts -- this is not a great book. The central mystery is pretty toothless, and there are a pair of subplots (one involving a principal and another the ever-lovin' Jenn) that don't have much bite either. Even the good guys are universally, sniggeringly sex-obsessed -- Jesse can't seem to have a conversation with Molly that doesn't include a reference to her one-night stand -- which makes their investigating sex crimes a bit disturbing. And Jesse does a thing or two in the line of police work that cannot be legal.On the other hand, Parker is suddenly gone. Which means that our times with Jesse, Suit, Molly and Sunny and Spike (who visit from one of Parker's other series) is now suddenly limited. So I found myself savoring the denizens of Paradise more than I would have under other circumstances.It's below average Parker, but below average Parker is better than no Parker at all. And that makes me sad. I like to read a Robert Parker novel whenever I want a book that is fast and simple to read. The characters are familiar, dialogue moves the action, and you can be distracted externally, and pick up where you leave off with ease. His books are ideal for travel: like snack food. The eighth police chief Jesse Stone novel, Night and Day, focuses on the theme of obsession. Readers know that Jesse remains obsessed with his ex-wife Jenn. After a peeping Tom in the town of Paradise increases his obsession and progresses to home invasion, molestation and then murder, Stone and his police team work to track him down. Along the lines of \"it takes one to know one,\" Stone examines the obsessive Night Hawk, as they call him, from the perspective of Stone's own obsession with Jenn. Sunny Randall and Spike make cameo appearances, as does Spenser's Susan Silverman. The pace of the novel is as quick as ever, and the dialogue is peppery. Before you know it, you'll have finished the book, the flight attendant will be announcing imminent landing, and you'll be somewhat satisfied that you didn't totally waste a boring flight doing nothing.Rating: Three-star (Recommended) LOVED IT!I love all the books in the Jesse Stone Series.This one is no exception.I just love Jesse ... Plain and Simple.I picture him as Tom Selleck while reading and I am gone.Can't wait for the new Jesse Stone movie on CBS Sunday March 1st. Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job.. Katherine Hilbery has everything - she is beautiful, well-born, intelligent, kind, reflective, sensitive, though not in a sentimental way, but... bored. She must find a purpose in life, other than being of a wealthy Chelsea family and the descendant of a famous poet, and she must choose between the weak-willed sophisticate William and the tempestuous Ralph. Though the love of the self-sacrificing suffragette Mary Datchet for Ralph and the upcoming law-clerk's failure to realise he is in thrall to Katherine provide a few twists and turns, such is in essence the plot of Night and Day.All would be well if this were the psychological drama it appears to be, set in an atmospheric turn-of-the-century London. But Virginia Woolf also pursues a political message: in this novel, women answer to male stereotypes and vice versa. The women are logical and career-minded, the men coy and romantic. This might be fine, and it makes for a few good scenes, except that it doesn't quite fit the characters. Mary's ill-starred fate seems gratuitous. Katherine's interest in mathematics is too obviously a code, never properly illustrated. And her falling in love with Ralph isn't credible - she is too good for him, and it is all too sudden. It seems Night and Day can't quite choose what it is supposed to be: psychological or social comedy. It lacks the simplicity of Woolf's first novel The Voyage Out, the wistfulness of Mrs Dalloway, or the experimental complexity of her later works. I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone novels; not this one! It was the usual Jesse and his Ex talking in circles around a peccadillo: a peeping Tom! Even in Paradise, I am sure something more interesting could happen! I will wait for the paper back next time Parker comes out with a new one. This deserves less than one star! A delightful edition of a masterpiece! Woolf was a profound writer and she stories are deep and complex. She wrote about the feelings that most of us have experienced at one time or another. This is why her work is considered by so many of her readers as something very special. Understood by women everywhere and a book that women should read at least once, its also a good book for men to read, to help understand women.To understand love, read Night and Day.Profound! Virginia Stephens Woolf (1882-1941) was born to Sir Leslie Stephens and his second wife. His first wife was one of William Makepeace Thackery's daughters. Woolf had brothers and a sister Vanessa. She was a shy, brilliant intellectual who committed suicide in 1941. She is the best known member of the Bloomsbury Group of authors/painters/poets and intellectuals who met at her home. Among this group are: Edward Morgan Forster; T.S. Eliot: Carrington; Lytton Strachey; Vanessa and Clive Bell; Duncan Grant and Virginia's husband Leonard Woolf.Virginia Woolf's first novel was \"The Voyage Out.\" She wrote diaries throughout her life as well as criticism. Woolf also spent time teaching literature to the poor. Virgnia was a liberal who had a lesbian relationship with Vita Sackville-West. She had no children.Night and Day was the second novel by young Virginia. It was published in 1919 after the author had spent several years writing it. Woolf had long periods of time when she grappled with mental health problems spending days in bed. She was carefully attended to by her husband Leonard.The Plot: The long novel deals with the love life of Katharine Hilbery and her friend Mary Datchet. The two women are very dissimilar. Katharine comes from a literary family much like the one in which Woolf grew up. Katharine is torn between love for Ralph Denham and William Rodney. Both men are attorneys. One of Katharine's relatives named Cassandra Otway also is in love with William Rodney leading to a messy triangle. Mary Datchett is attracted to Denham. She is a worker in the Women's suffrage cause in England. In the end all the love problems are resolved.The novel is rich in the use of bird imagery to describe the emotions felt by the characters. Night is symbolic of the dreamy world often inhabited by young Katharine and her Ralph Denham who holds an idealistic dream of love. Day refers to the everyday world of London life.Though the book has its boring parts it is, nevertheless, an Edwardian novel which shows the promise of a young writer who fulfilled her potential in such better books as \"Mrs Dalloway\"; \"The Waves\"; \"Orlando\" and \"To the Lighthouse.\" These later books make much more use of stream of consciousness and indirect communication among the characters.The book may be dull to many but Woolf's beautiful writing in which she describes London and the feelings of her leading characters makes this a novel of interest. A neglected gem by a great author! Another entertaining book from the hand of Robert Parker. He just keeps doing it. ZERO STARS. Everyone has read the complaints about Parker's latest works - double spacing, large fonts, one third pages, etc. Until you try one his books on audio, you do not know how bad it has gotten. I bought this book on CD's for a recent trip. I know the books had gotten shorter but you can't hide that in audio - the unabridged edition is a total of 5 discs with a spacer taking up half the box to make the box look normal size for a novel.On top of that, if you eliminated the amateur technique, you would remove 40% more of the book. Almost every line ends with \"name said\" - as in \"What do you think?\", Jesse said. \"I don't know.\", Molly said. When reading the books, your eyes can easily skip over this. When listening to it on audio, there is no way to tune it out. After less than half a disc, I have had to stop. Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Parker - I own every book he has published - but this may be the last. ROBERT B. PARKER - make an effort or hang it up - this is embarrassing. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Robert Parker's final Jesse Stone novel reflects the authors declining health before his death. Parker seems to be going through the motions. The dialogue remains witty and snappy but there is not much else. It appears that Parker was rushing to complete this novel before his death. You can skim read this in an hour or two.The plot revolves around a peeping Tom who is stalking women in Paradise plus sending notes to Police Chief Jesse Stone, saying he is going to take his obsession to the next level. Parker fans will enjoy but also will be disappointed. Unfortunately, this is the final book in the series but not the greatest. I think I've probably read everything written by Robert B. Parker. I like his pacing, his characters, his dialogue and his plots. He creates worlds of black and white and periodically it satisfies me to inhabit these worlds. I love how the mysteries unfold themselves and his ability to embrace morality without seeming cheesey. Once again, this novel made me a very happy reader.The plot for this Jesse Stone novel is easily relatable. No big time crime lords here, the story centers on quiet desperation and crossing boundaries. As always, the reader gets to witness Jesse's struggle with alcohol and women but this time, he seems to be making progress on all fronts.Robert B. Parker is in my top 5 of favorite authors and I'm already looking forward to his next novel. Fingers crossed that Private Detective Sunny Randall will be the focus of his next published effort. How can anyone not enjoy Jesse, Suit & Molly - every book is a delight. Love Jesse's humor and outlook on life - drinker or not! After the rather awfulStranger In Paradise (Jesse Stone)I was afraid the whole series was going to just fizzle.I was pleasantly surprised with \"Night and Day\". It is a return to higher standard of reading to which I had grown accustomed. The plot moves along nicely, the witty banter is plentiful. The case is distressing but not super-hero level.I will not go into all of the plot details. Those are outlined by others on the page. All in all, this is a pleasant and quick read. Everything I look for in a Parker novel - detecting, banter, psychobabble and a bit of romance (in a macho sort of way, of course). Before I jump into my review of Robert B. Parker's newest \"Jesse Stone\" novel, Night and Day, allow me to first to give a big plug for the five TV movies based on the series that Tom Selleck has produced and starred in, the most recent being Thin Ice, which was aired by CBS on Sunday, March 1st. Selleck captures the role of Jesse Stone perfectly, and each movie is a slow burn, filled with excellence on every level. If you're a fan of the novels, then you owe it to yourself to see the TV movies. Except for Thin Ice, the other four (Stone Cold, Night Passage, Death in Paradise, and Sea Change) are out on DVD. Also, CBS tends to broadcast a \"Jesse Stone\" movie every so often, so keep an eye out.Now, on to Night and Day, which is the eighth novel in the \"Jesse Stone\" series. Like the seven previous books, the small-town chief of police has to deal with three cases simultaneously, which keeps the story line moving along at a brisk pace and the reader from being bored. I probably should mention that while Jesse's attempting to solve his three cases, he's also battling his obsession with his ex-wife, Jenn, and with alcoholism, both of which are tied closely together.This time around, Jesse has to deal with a rather unusual situation that involves a female high-school principal and a panty check of the young girls going to the school dance on one particular night. The principal claims that she was only doing it to make sure the girls intended to be good and not naughty by wearing thongs and other sexy lingerie underneath their skirts. The parents of the children, however, are outraged over the act and want Jesse to do something about it. He pretty much agrees with the parents and thinks that it's definitely an invasion of privacy, but it doesn't help matters that the principal just happens to be married to the head of Boston's top law firm. Along with that problem, Jesse has to deal with a voyeur who calls himself the Night Hawk and likes to look into the windows of women as they're undressing at night. His antics soon escalate into daytime breaking & entering, not to mention home invasion, and Jesse's worried that someone may eventually get hurt during the commission of the crime. Last, but not least, a young girl approaches Jesse to complain about her swinging parents and how it's hurting the family. Jesse doesn't have a problem with consenting adults swinging, if that's what they want to do, but when children are experiencing the negative side effects in this type of behavior, he feels the need to step in and do something about it before more emotional damage is caused.The story line and pacing of Night and Day are similar to the other books in the series, and the reader doesn't really encounter anything new here. The fun of the books, however, is in getting to visit with Jesse Stone for a few hours and to see how he's doing and to find out what's happening in Paradise, Massachusetts. The reader knows going into the story that Jesse will solve the crimes in one fashion or another, but it's Jesse himself that's the big attraction. He a good man, a tough man when necessary, but he still has problems like everybody else. As a reader and fan, I want to know how's he coping with his alcoholism and with the addiction to his ex-wife. Actually, I want to see him happy and at peace with himself, which leads to one very good thing about this particular novel--private investigator Sunny Randall is back (she and Jesse decide to give it another shot), plus her best friend, Spike, is opening a new restaurant in Paradise.As with most of Mr. Parker's books, Night and Day is well written with sharp, crisp dialogue that makes the reader want to try out some of the lines at work. And, like the TV movies, the novels basically follow the saga of Jesse Stone's life to see where he's at and how he's dealing with the day-to-day challenges. I think most readers can identify with the chief of police on many levels, be it problems with the person you love, or the need to drink in order to escape the stress of everyday life.Robert B. Parker's novels are always a delight to read and certainly entertaining in every sense of the word. Night and Day is no exception, and is a wonderful addition to an already marvelous series. I'll also add that older readers tend to enjoy Jesse Stone somewhat more than the younger ones, but Robert B. Parker does have a large fan base of all ages. Coming in May, the third novel in the \"Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch\" western series. Yeeeeehaaaa!"

         "The Center of Everything : A Novel",
         "I am always looking for a good book to read, and I very rarely find one worth finishing. This book was quite the opposite; I wished it had gone on longer. It is a great book and I wish I heard about it more often, it deserves to be a best-seller. This book was wonderful. I could feel the humid air and smell the lilacs with drops of water leftover, after a rainfall. I love the way Evelyn's thoughts are so black and white. It is or it isn't. I can't wait for another great story from Moriarty. Personally, I see little to compare between Laura Moriarty's The Center of Everything and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Both are fine books but Mockingbird centers on racism in the south years before the Civil Rights movement and this book is, in my opinion, a true coming of age novel.The protagonist, Evelyn Bucknow , was born out of wedlock to a mother who does her best for her daughter until depression overtakes her when she finds herself without a job and pregnant, but unmarried, a second time. Moriarty writes with such insight that you can't help but feel the child's pain, as well as the depths of the mother's despair. In fact, you can't help but feel FOR the mother even though her actions are responsible for their endless poverty. Because of an out-of-wedlock, teen pregnancy, the path was set--a path that young Evelyn has no choice but to live and survive.I hope I haven't led you to believe Evelyn's story is depressing because it isn't. Young Evelyn is smart! She is a thinker! I recommend the book to all ages but, especially to young readers, as it has a message that is straight and true: A single mistake can change your life, so use your head and learn from others. I liked the story and how the point of view of the narrator evolves as she grows and matures. The ending was a little drab, though. I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the characters futures. I read this book in 2 days and loved every bit of it. It's definitely a must read!! I highly recommended this book to anyone. The book rec's was in good condition. Enjoyable....but I prefer non-fiction. Recommended to me by a friend. Everyone is saying this has the distinct voice of To Kill a Mockingbird and it really is very similar. The story is not really like Mockingbird but the narrative perspective is told in the same way by Evelyn Bucknow. The book covers eight years of Evelyn's adolescence--from 10 years onto her graduation from high school. Her mother is constantly trying to make ends meet financially, and she loves Evelyn deeply. There is a great schism in the family because Tina, Evelyn's mother, had her out of wedlock. Tina's parents are extreme fundamentalists that will not let her forget her past. When Tina becomes pregnant again with a married man's baby, the problems start all over again, and Evelyn's grandmother, Eileen, is the only family that will talk to them.Evelyn's brother, Samuel, is born prematurely and it is soon obvious that he is mentally handicapped. Tina's role in the book changes to constant caretaker of Samuel, and Evelyn moves into her teenage years nearly alone. Her grandmother begins taking her to church, and Evelyn finds some answers there... yet she struggles with questions when one of her favorite teachers in school, Ms. Jenkins, becomes the target of a smear campaign by the fundamentalists for teaching evolution to the children. Evelyn's struggle to decide whether to side with her grandmother and the \"nice people at the church\" or her teacher shows exactly how Evelyn is certainly in the center of everything.The Center of Everything brings together many situations that Evelyn must confront--and she is a strong girl who has a very wise voice for someone so young. I wanted to love this book. I really did. It flows nicely and I connected with the characters. I found myself really caring about what happened to them, and I even teared up a time or two. The problem? NOTHING ever happened to them. I kept reading and reading, thinking something big was about to drop, and then it was just more-- nothing. There were a couple times in which it seemed like something might be about to happen, but nope. It's just a story about any old girl from nowhere, USA, who doesn't quite fit in and doesn't know quite who she is; most of us lived that, so why would we want to read it? Plus I HATED the ending. I get that the story will be continued in future books, but I'm not interested enough to spend the time and money to read any more. I usually avoid books featuring child narrators like the plague, but when I recently picked up The Center of Everything, the writing was so winsome and Evelyn and her mother's precarious situation so compelling that I kept reading. And I'm so glad I did, because I got a lot more than I bargained for: The Center of Everything is a novel that I actively looked forward to returning to every night so I could see what the characters were up to, and toward the end I rationed out the pages so I could stay in Moriarty's Kerrville, Kansas a while longer. The character of Tina is a particular triumph; Moriarty gives her wit and warmth and shatters preconceptions about welfare mothers while remaining true to situation. Wise and compassionate and laugh-aloud funny, The Center of Everything is a book to be treasured and reread. Wonderful novel. The Center of Everything is one of those rare coming of age novels full of emotional pathos and personal growth that somehow touches a deep nerve within, especially if you were about the same age in the Reagan era 80's as protagonist Evelyn Bucknow. It is a novel about a smart girl living in a small Kansas town with her overwhelmingly depressed, trampy \"welfare queen\" mother searching for a better path in life than the path her mother chose. Told from Evelyn's perspective between the ages of 10 through 18, the first half of the novel focuses on her increasingly strained relationship with her somewhat unattentive mother. When Evelyn reaches the breaking point with her mother and \"a black line\" is drawn between them, the novel then focuses on Evelyn's fractured friendships, painfully unrequited love and her desire to improve the quality of her life. Moriarty's prose is thoughtful and breezy with a touch of child-like innocence. The characters are achingly real keeping you riveted to the page not from suspense but from a desire to get to know them better. You'll find your emotions run high as you love/hate many of the characters, especially Evelyn's mother. Touching and poignant, sad but never sappy The Center of Everything is a believable account of a girl's search for herself and her place in the world. This book ends with Evelyn standing on the porch with her special needs brother and a storm is approaching. What's that all about? Not worth the read...Very disappointed.. Everlyn Bucknow is a little girl with very little stability, but more than enough spunk to cope with her very roller coaster life. This book touched me very deeply. The terror of living so close to the edge of total poverty, that a mechanical problem with a car turns your entire world upside down. The unbelievable importance of caring and noticing teachers who can inspire a dream of a different way of life in a child. Send the kids to Grandmas for the weekend and lose yourself in this well written and inspiring book. While interesting, the story was a bit predictable and I found it to be depressing at times. Would appeal to teens. It did keep my attention; However, very depressing and it just abruptly ended. I liked the main character, Evelyn. Would not have compared it to, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;. My two year old daughter accidentally bought this book and I think it is one of the best accident to happen as of late. Is there a sequel? The book was written well but at the end there was so much that was left hanging. I very much enjoyed this book. It is a good indication of how someone that is born into poverty and faces many challenges is able to rise above it by the life choices she makes.I also had admiration for Tina, the mother. Her life choices were not good, but, she possessed a fierce love for her children.I especially admired the work she put in with her handicapped son.I would have given it five stars, but, the ending left me wanting more. Hopefully, a sequel will be written. So, if you like your books to leave you depressed, this is a great one for you. The story follows Evelyn, the daughter of an unwed mother, from fourth grade until it stops without any apparent reason just prior to her graduation from high school. The ending makes no sense - it literally just stops without warning.The author has a good grasp on writing, which is why I have given her two stars instead of the one star the book probably deserved. The author dwells only on the negative and doesn't give us any glimpse of a good thing that might have happened to Evelyn during the eight years. Death, autism, teenage pregnancy, adultery, blah, blah, blah. Evelyn rises above it but without giving us any idea how she does so.Along the journey, the author snipes at conservative politics, Reagan, Oliver North, Christianity, and any other sort of morality. Hysterically, the author dwells on Iran Contra as if it consumed thought for eight years when reality is that it was a blip on the political scene that lasted only a short time. Strange and rather boring to read about in 2011. The only interesting thing I noted from this was that while the author was trying to beat Christianity to pieces, the only truly nice people in Evelyn's life, the ones that gave without expectation of any return, were the Christians.Apart from the author's political agenda and liberal ideology slapping you across the head over and over again, the abrupt ending is a horrible disservice to a reader who waded through the morass of it all, only to be stopped without satisfaction. Because of the ending, I cannot recommend the book. I am so glad I finally read this book. I've had it laying around for the past couple years and never gave it much thought, but it turned out to be an excellent read.This is the story of Evelyn Bucknow. She lives in Kerrville, Kansas with her young mother and no father. We meet her at age 11 and follow her to her last year in high school. In that time she experiences her first love, and first heartache...the feeling of being an outsider, and the betrayal of her one true friend. She learns that young people do not in fact live forever, and she slowly realizes what she wants out of life, and how to acheive it.I highly recommend this book. Evelyn has such a voice for being so young, and her struggles through adolescence are at times both heartbreaking and joyous. I would really love to see a sequal to this book, to learn how Evelyn, her mother, her mentally retarded brother Samuel, and her beloved grandmother Eileen turn out. This was a great book, and I absolutely look forward to reading her future novels. A good book for teenagers if they can see that one's actions determine one's consequences and that this isn't just another story. Evelyn's mother has made poor choices all her life, but even in her poor choices, she's found good. One good was Evelyn, the other was her handicapped child Samuel, the result of another poor choice. But Samuel may also be what saves the mother and leads her to begin to make good choices. Evelyn's grandfather made a very poor choice when he chose to label his daughter (Evelyn's mother) with harsh words, to be a poor father, and in essence turn his back on his child. His choice led Evelyn's mother to make the choices she made. One wonders what choices someone before him made which led to the choices he made. (He was not only an awful father, but an awful husband.) \"What happened to Eileen's mouth?\" Evelyn asked her mother. \"She married my father,\" her mother answers. I loved it when Evelyn's teacher planted that seed in Evelyn's head about choices. When the book ends we know, even though it's not stated and the book just sort of ends, that Evelyn will live her life better that her mother and the difference will be in her awareness of the consequences, both for good and for bad, in making choices. I'd love to have a cup of coffee with the author, and compare notes on mothers. This book really touched me, and it's rare to find a book that can make me laugh as hard as it makes me cry. She has a wicked, clever style of narrative that kept me hooked the entire time. I enjoyed getting to know these characters. Evelyn was a complex character with many of the same feelings and questions of most teenage girls. I loved being inside her thoughts and emotions then getting to understand her reasoning and thought process. I was disappointed that the book came to an end. I wish there was a sequel so I would know how they ended up. It was a little too abrupt of an ending. I also enjoyed going back to the 80's and reliving some of my teenage years. I enjoyed this book a great deal, although others I loaned it to, found it a tad depressing. It is during the same period of time I grew up, the 80's, but in a small rural town. It is a story of a flower growing out of weeds, a young girl growing up with a single mom whom makes bad choices but is still likable and kind. Very nice touching book. I enjoyed this book, especially since I got it at such a bargain price. The character of Evelyn is very real, very familiar to anyone who was ever a teenage girl. I held back on the fifth star because of my confusion about her mother (is she crazy, is just selfish?) but the mother evolves as well, just as life does. The situations involving young love and broken hearts resonated as very true. I will read another book by this author for sure! I must comment that I love a marked down price in order to get familiar with an author! I think it is a marketing tool that is a win win! This is a coming of age story about Evelyn, a young girl with a single mother. They live in Kansas and Evelyn is a lonely and bored young girl. The character development was interesting but the plot was not. I found it slow and very drawn out. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to finish and at the end it was a disapointment. I bought this book because it looked fun and it was free. It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud at times. Being a mother of girls and also a daughter myself, I could relate to both Evelyn and her mother. As the reader I found myself rooting for Evelyn and her mother..each likeable characters in their own way. The book covers the mother/daughter relationship from Eveyln as a preadolescent who adores her mom through the alienation and breaking away of the teenage years to a time just before Evelyn leaves for college and has gainedc respect and appreciation for her mother. I especially enjoyed the fact that this book held my interest without violence, excessive profanity or dark and depressing themes. Loved this snapshot of growing up in the 80's. The characters are all either judging or being judged as they deal with the consequences of their actions. Some scenarios are hilarious when viewed from Evelyn's perspective. Even better on the second read. I loved the writer's style, and thought she captured the personality of the main character and the thoughts, feelings, and nuances of her life at each age throughout the story.Religion was a strong thread throughout and while I would have been okay with that as an underlying issue, it was a bit too strong of a secondary storyline for my tastes. I found myself wanting to skim through some of those parts to get back to the \"good stuff.\"Overall, enjoyed the book."

         "After getting through the first 50 pages of the book it is very apparent that nobody proof-read this book before sending it to the presses. There are typos throughout the book. Run on sentences that were also a cause of confusion. Then to really put the nail in the coffin, there are missing steps in many of the excerises leaving the reader guessing how something was done. Horrible book ! Don't waste your money or your time on this one."

         "The Description & Setting volume for the Write Great Fiction series might not be the last word on these subjects, or the one book that has it all, but it provides a good overview and plenty of material for further reflection. Well worth the purchase price. Like the other \"Write Great Fiction\" books, this one focuses on the elements listed on the title, description and setting. While the criticisms some others have had are sound, this is by no means a terrible book, and certainly it is not as awful as some would make it out to be. As for the criticism that there is \"nothing new\" in the book, that's easy. The author makes the assumption (as he should, seeing as how every other good author who has ever written a non-fiction work on any given subject would do the same) that the reader knows nothing, or little about how to write descriptive passages but wants to know more, so having \"no new information\" is an empty criticism. He isn't writing his book for people who already know the concepts, he is writing for those who don't know but want to learn them. The \"nothing is new\" criticism is like a math teacher being critical towards a new math book that comes out since it offers \"nothing new.\" Obviously the math teacher already knows the concepts that are covered in the math book.But I have spent more than enough time on that. This book will teach you how to describe aspects the reader can see, hear, feel, touch and smell, thus bringing them into the story. It will teach you how little description is too little, and how much is too much. It will teach you how to get the reader to paint a mental picture of the world you create in your story. It will teach you how to apply the other aspects of writing fiction, such as plot, dialogue and character development and how they relate to description. It will teach you how to create a single sentence that is chock full of information that the reader needs to know to understand the context of your story. That is what the author intended, that is what he does, and that is why this book is worth the money. This is a practical and useful reference. Using examples from excellent writers, providing good tips for new approaches, it also gives exercises to develop techniques that make for better writing, authentic writing, more enjoyable writing. I'm glad I bought this book. I definitely use it as a reference. I wish I'd bought it when I first started writing."

         "A Bride Most Begrudging",
         "I was not sure I would like this book, even after seeing the high reviews it received. I finally gave it a shot, and my only disappointment was that I waited so long to read it. I LOVED it, and finished the book in 3 days. I really liked the characters and various writing styles thoughout the book. It's a beautiful story and I hope it becomes a film one day soon! Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature. This was a pretty nice read. I really enjoyed the story line. If you are a romance enthusiast you will probably like this one. This is the first historical Christian romance I've ever read, and I absolutely loved it. Deeanne Gist is going to be a star, mark my words. Witty and charming, this is a story you won't forget. Lady Constance Morrow and Drew O'Connor are wonderful characters and before the book is over, you feel as if you've known them forever. Bravo, Deeanne, and thanks for a great read! This book is awesome. I can't read it enough. The fact that they were forced to marry is just necessary for the story line, but the fact that they have some of the normal problems of a couple. Their reasons for these issues is that they won't communicate, & that they do it because they love each other. I truely enjoyed this book. I found myself crying at times and laughing out loud at others. I really enjoyed the historic realness. This is not an easy book to put down and walk away from. I do not like to read and I loved this book. Sometimes I had a hard time putting it down. It was clean, fun, and kept my interest. I am already on another book by that author. I really enjoyed this book! Although it does carry a religious message, (probably because of the nature of this time period), I think it portrayed the struggles of the new American colonists very well. I liked way the romance fits in historically. I especially liked Constance as a character. I found the ending very abrupt. I picked this up, not knowing it was a Christian historical romance, but was not sure I'd enjoy it after reading some of the reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised, even though I knew how it would end well before the end.Constance is brought to Virginia after being kidnapped on the docks, and is sold to Drew, a planter who has lost his true love and wants nothing to do with the fiery Constance. When they are married to protect the morals of the area, it's in name only and Drew promises to help her get back to England, if her story checks out. As the book progresses, the couple has to figure out if their initial dislike can turn to attraction and maybe love.My biggest issue with this is that it's a story that's been done before. There aren't any twists to the story, nothing radical, it's just a pleasant reading experience. There isn't any sex; some of the prior reviews mention how much they lust after each other, and I kept waiting to see how \"scandalous\" the relationship would get, and there was barely any mention of them making love. But I just read \"50 Shades of Grey\" and maybe I'm sexed out, because I didn't mind the lack of racy dialogue in this book.It would be nice if the author would consider going back to revisit the characters in a future book. Josh, Drew's brother, was an interesting character, worthy of his own storyline, and their sisters, Nellie and Sally, would make for fun reads. Otherwise, this is a nice book to read to pass the time. I didn't understand all of the rave reviews of this book. I found it to be very boring in places and drawn out. I understand that the author was trying to do all possible to make this book true to the time period she was writing about, however, much of the time the dialogue between the characters was hard to read..I didn't understand the reviews either that some were saying there was a lot of lust and offensive things in this book. There was nothing out of place in my opinion.I didn't hate this book, but I didn't overly enjoy it either. I would have quit reading it half way through if I didn't have to always finish what I start. If I would have just got this from the library, I would have deff quit reading it in the middle. A very engaging story . . . I was most surprised due to the fact that this was not my favorite type/catagory of book but I was not able to put it down. Gist is an outstanding author who has created a real page turner. She does not drag it out but tugs at your heart til you find your eyes flying over the pages to see what happens next! I absolutely loved the personalities and the way she leads you through their own personal spiritual struggles and victories.... this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!! I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end. American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century. Taken from her home in England against her will, Lady Constance Morrow is shipped to America, where she is to be sold to a Virginia colony farmer as a 'tobacco bride'. The daughter of an Earl, Constance is appalled by her humiliating circumstances. By an odd twist of fate, she ends up becoming the wife of Drew O'Conner, who had never intended to marry at all.Her position as a colony farmer's wife is very different from the life Constance had previously led. To Drew's increasing frustration, she has no skill with cooking and cleaning, and would rather solve mathematical equations than work. Tempers flare between both parties as they adjust to their new lifestyles. Nevertheless, though she began as a bride most begrudging, both Drew and Constance find their marriage of convenience turning into something more than either expected... Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love. Superficial christian message. I will not be reading anymore of her books. I agree with another reviewer this is soft \"christian porn\". I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I was waiting for this terrible \"lust\" to start...I didn't get it. First of all, they were married, and secondly they were married!! I don't think there is anything wrong with a man and woman being attracted to one another, especially if they are married!I never even figured out what these ladies were talking about, all I saw was an attraction, and not lust. Someone said that the characters just lusted after one another, and that there was no love...I think that the author showed the love grow...just like any marriage that starts off like theirs did, you will never have instant love, love is something that takes time. Physical attraction on the other hand can happen much sooner, which is what the author demonstrated.I really liked the book, it was easy to read. Someone else pointed out the historical inaccuracies, well that may be so, but I still enjoyed the book. I love the friction between the two main characters, it makes for an exciting and sometimes funny read! A true romance with out graphic sex! So cool. I thought it a wonderful story and fell in love with the characters! I liked the Christian over tones as well. I loved it and read it in two days."

         "Maniac Magee (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)",
         "Manic Magee Diesel Hayes#8Manic Magee AKA: Jeffery Magee is a boy who lost his parents at age three years old. They died in a train crash. He ran away when he was only 7 years old. He went to live with his aunt and uncle but they always argued a lot. He wanted to live by himself but he was in the West End were the white kids were . All he wanted was to fit in with the black kids but he didn't have anyone to live with. So he made a new friend that provided a roof over his head.THE END Jerry Spinelli breaks down the stereotypes of what a \"traditional\" family should be in his novel Maniac Magee. Jeffrey Magee, (known as Maniac for some outlandish feats he performs) a strong-willed boy, uses his ingenuity to overcome adversity and find himself a home.Maniac is orphaned at three and moves in with his aunt and uncle who hate each other. Subsequently, they don't even talk to one another. After eight years of this non-existence, Maniac runs away from home. Maniac literally runs in search of a home. He becomes part of several families that he meets in the town of Two Mills. Suzanne Bunker says, \"We are not the Cleavers, we have single-families; step-families; adoptive and foster families; children raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles; gay and lesbian families; and individuals of all ages living together, unrelated biologically but still a family\" (116). The latter mirrors the situations in which Maniac finds himself. The first family with whom Maniac lives is the Beales. They are an African-American family living in the East End of Two Mills. They are a `traditional' family (mom, dad, big sister Amanda, little sister Hester and little brother Lester), and they welcome him into this family with open arms; his skin color is of no significance to the Beales. On his first night there, Maniac checks the front door of the house:number 728.Maniac has a home. He is part of a family. He loves the Beales and the East End and all the colors of the East End. \"He couldn't understand why they called themselves black ...he saw gingersnap and light fudge and dark fudge and acorn and butter rum and cinnamon and burnt orange. But they were never licorice which to him was real black\" (Spinelli 51). Unfortunately, because of his white skin, not everyone loves Maniac in the East End. Maniac feels that he has to leave his beloved Beales to protect them. He runs until he meets Grayson, a caretaker at the zoo. Grayson, an older man, takes Maniac in and gives him a home. As Suzanne Bunkers comments, this mirrors a grandparent raising the child (116). At Thanksgiving, Maniac prays, \"thank you for this warm house and our own little family\" (Spinelli 108). He goes outside and paints \"101\" on the front door, justifying their existence and their home. Sadly, Grayson dies, and once again Maniac is orphaned. Maniac runs again until he finds another family, the McNabs. This family, from the West End, consists of a drunken father and three neglected sons. Maniac feels that these children live like orphans. Maniac tries to instill right from wrong in the McNab children but wonders, \"how he could act as a father to these boys when he himself ached to be somebody's son?\" (155). This is not a good environment for Maniac. The McNabs are racist, and Maniac cannot live with them. He feels pride for the East End. He runs away from the McNabs to the zoo, until Amanda Beale comes to call him home. \"You are coming home...to sleep in your room...not here. This is not your home\"(183). Maniac is happy to go home. \"Children's literature is increasingly demonstrating that families cannot be so easily dichotomized as `traditional' or `non-traditional' and no one family is `normal', `typical', or representative of all families\" (Bunkers 128). Spinelli embraces these new types of families that mirror our culture in his novel and because of this, he is able to give a boy a home to call his own.Cited works: Spinelli,Jerry. Maniac Magee. Boston:Little, Brown and Company,1990. Bunkers, Suzanne. \"We Are Not The Cleavers\": Images of Non-traditional Families in Children's Literature\"The Lion and the Unicorn 16.1 (1992):115-133. This book is written by my favorite author - Jerry Spinelli. This book is so good that each time I read it, it gets more suspensful, fun, and there is more adventure each time. I would recommend this book to people who like suspense and action. If you like Harry Potter, you will love Maniac Magee. He's like Harry Potter, except he does it without magic. Since this book won the Newbery, I expected a good book. But it's mostly tells, not shows--a no-no for writers. The author tells just about everything. There aren't that many actual dialogue scenes between the characters. I didn't find this book interesting at all. Just because a book wins the Newbery doesn't mean it's going to be a winner. Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T. DarkBlade Upon finishing Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli, I think I love it and dislike it all at the same time. Whenever I prepare to write a review on Amazon, I like to read as many previously written reviews as possible, just to gauge where everyone else stands with the novel. It seems as though the five star reviews loved this book because of the message and plot involved. Many of the one star reviewers, though, said the book was \"boring.\"Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing kids saying that \"I wouldn't have read this book if it weren't assigned in school.\" I dislike seeing kids being forced to read a certain book, because it may turn them off to further reading at a crucial age. Since this book has received the reputable Newbery Award some time ago, interest in it is higher than usual. However, as I said with Kira-Kira, PLEASE don't blindly assign children to read award winning books simply because they are on some list. Just because they have won these fantastic awards, doesn't mean they're for everybody.This book intends to tell the story of racial prejudice. Jerry Spinelli usually tackles some interesting issues in his stories, and Maniac Magee is no exception. The storyline itself is compelling and charming and some of the characters are very likeable, particularly Grayson, Amanda and her family. There were so many characters in this book though, that it was easy to get them mixed up.I know a few people who love the work of Jerry Spinelli and enthusiastically promote his work. As a result I decided to check out some of his novels. Spinelli writes in such a quirky way that one would find either off-putting or fantastic. I think I'm somewhere in between. While I love the fact that his novels are unique and unusual, I can see how children could find his writing difficult to read at times. He doesn't always flow smoothly and uses a very unusual style to describe something. He's not your typical author, that's for sure.This book is recommended for ages 8 through 12. Usually children like to read a book whose characters are older than they are. Spinelli's characters are usually rather young and would naturally attract a younger audience. However, the way that he writes may be too difficult for such a young audience. I was a bright kid, but honestly I think a lot of this novel would have gone over my head if I read it at age 8, simply because the reader has to read between the lines a great deal of the time with this book and my capabilities of doing that at age 8 were limited at best. If I know I would have struggled with it, I know there are other children out there who would do the same. This is not to say that ALL children would not understand this book, but there will be some. Well, I am now a true fan of Spinelli's first I read Stargirl and now this wonderful tale. In a way he reminds me of John Steinbeck, both have this organic quality to their writing. You know these characters they are writing about aren't real, but at the same time you instantly feel like these are people you could look up from the page of your book and meet--the feel like people you already know. Which is amazing. Clearly Spinelli is in the right line of work.Maniac Magee has the same tall tale feel to it that Stargirl does. The world he plays in is a little bigger than hers, but both are loved and hated in very similar ways. He also refuses to see a persons faults and instead only focuses on their worth.Overall the book is sending a message about racisim, and how it really doesn't make sense, but there are other lessons througout the book. Which is really impressive because even for a book at this age level it isn't that long. Each chapter is only a few pages long which gives the reader the same feeling of running that Maniac Magee does throughout the entire book.No wonder school kids are always having to read this for some class or another. Its a book that tackles serious subjects but in a way that is not heavy handed and at times light hearted.Great great book!one last thought--ironic isn't it, how he is always running, like he's in a race and the book is about racisim? interesting play on words Spinelli does there. I thought the book was boring. Maniac's parents died in a P and W trolley falling off a bridge because the driver was drunk.After Maniac heard the news,he stayed with his aunt and uncle.He ran away because his aunt and uncle annoyed him because they had seperate things and they never talk to each other.As he ran, he spoted the ball park.At the end,he realizes that life is not a game.This book made me think about running from problems. I am using this book with my students. They seem to enjoy the book, and enjoy discussing Jeffery (Maniac). I feel that the characters are well developed which in turn brings out the problems with the two sides of the new town. We read a book dealing with prejudious and racism last year. Therefore, I felt using a book that was in the same vein, but taking a different tatic on the subject would also be good. I like a book that keeps the students interest. Also it makes it good for comprehension, and it will lead to some writing assignments as well. Maniac Magee was an excellent book with a moral.Maniac's parents die from an accident, so Maniac is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Maniac decides to run away from the both of them, leaving Maniac homeless. In Maniac's city, all the black people were on the East Side and all the white people were on the West Side. Maniac goes and lives with new friend's that he meets, both on the East Side and on the West Side. No one is to onto the opposite \"Side\" unless that person works there. Blacks on one side, whites on the other. Maniac has many fantastic talents. He can run super, super fast, untie a know that measures over three blocks long when finally undone, and many others. The moral of this story is: don't judge people by their skin color.Maniac Magee is over all, a great book! I recommend this book to all ages! This is what I thouthg of the book: it was so-so. This book was about a little boy who lst his parents when he was a little boy so when he found out he had to go live with his Aunt Dot and his Uncle Dan On is Aunt and Uncle did not get along because they had to do stuff seperley so Maniac ran away and lived with his friend and he made new friends.This book made me think of who it whould fill with out my mom and bad,and how it will fill if I had to live with Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan. So this is what i thouth of the book. Although I've always been a fan of Jerry Spinelli's writing, this is definitely his best work. Warning: If you're looking for plot summary, read the standard amazon review, 'cause I don't want to repeat it.It's amazing how Spinelli has managed to take an issue as touchy as racial prejudice and managed to present it in a way that is not only understandable, but very realistic...Spinelli writes with a style that not only tells the story of a poor orphaned kid with famous - nay, legendary - abilities, but also provokes thought on many other issues, including racism, death, seperation, and many other scary but real issues in the lives of America's youth.I've read this book numerous times over the course of my life, and as I've gotten older (6 years or so have passed since I first read it), I still appreciate the message and story told by this book. My whole family (2 grown ups and a twelve year old) enjoyed this one. A really good story, one you don't want to put down. Best of all, it is infused with a message of tolerance that doesn't preach. Perfect for 5th and 6th graders. As a kid, this book drew me in quickly. It is fast paced and fun, and \"Maniac\" lives the life every little boy wishes he could. But to read the whole novel is not to want to stay young... Jeffrey learns about responsibility, and maturity, and how to love the unloveable. The book teaches us that home is a place of love and healing and growth, not a place where people look similar. I fell in love with this book in third grade, but it might be a bit more suitable for the 5th-7th grade level, or a fairly advanced reader of a younger age. Maniac Magee is a wonderful book. It was great, Once I started reading it I was hooked for the rest of the book. I liked how Maniac even though he was small he could do things that other bigger kids didn't. It gave a chance for the short people to be better than everybody else at something. It is about a boy orphand when he was only three years old. He is sent to live with his closest relatives. He can't stand them. His relatives argued a lot and stopped talking to each other. He Loves to run, he better at things than any other kid and he prooves it. It shows that even thought he is good at everything he has feelings too. I really liked it, I will tell everybody I know to read this book. It is intended for mainly teenagers. From the Beales to Earl Grayson. This kid is a legend. Maniac in my point of view is he is a kind-hearted kid, who always takes your breath away. I wish the story never had to end. I also take Maniac as a diamond in the rough. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do. I gave this wonderful story a five star rating. Thank you for your time.- Secret Reader I think the book Maniac Magee is a great book by Jerry Spinell. He really explained alot of things in detail. It is a very funny and exciting book! I really liked the wayManaic Magee wasn't scared of anyone and he could make friends with anyone. My favorite part was when Manaic hit the frog fling home run. I think that the way people were willing to help manaic out and be there for him shows the good side of our world. Amanda was a great charctor because she was helpful in everyway. I know that this book shows how people can help each other and how the blacks and whites can work together. I would recommend this book to any one that might have probles with different colored skin that can understand how to work there prprobles out. Or to just a young teen that is looking for a good book to read. I know I love this bookbecause I have read it more than once and I hope you will too. The character in this story is Maniac Magee, but his name isn't really Maniac Magee. when he was born, he was known as Jeffrey Lionel Magee. His parnets died nad that's when his life changed and so did his name.the best known thing that Maniac or \"Jeffrey \" Magee is known for is for what he did for the kids from the east side and those from the west side. But there still a puzzeling question. Whyndid he help those kids and why was he near those areas. If you want to find out more go to your local libary and check it out. You'll never know what will surprise you."

         "The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))",
         "It is very easy to see why this novel is a classic, i do not know about other people conclusions but for me it shows simply that our own mind is a very hard judge for us, humans; and that our natural behavior hardly ever gonna live up to our mind expectations. This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde. It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \"wanted\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could. The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process. Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt. Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book. You are supposed to hate most of the characters. Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards. This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant. Cheers The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust. arrived in good shape; classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time. The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull. This book makes for a good read. :) Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain. Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\"The picture of Dorian Gray\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work. This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \"successful\". With this Annotated and Uncensored Edition of Wilde's book, we have its history and definitive text. The Contents:General IntroductionTextual IntroductionTHE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYTextual NotesAppendix A: Accidental Changes Introduced into the Text by J. M. Stoddart or His AssociatesAppendix B: The 1891 Preface to THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYNotes of Wilde EditionsFurther ReadingThe annotations are in-depth, fascinating and informative, reflecting the era in which the novel was spawned, aspects of Wilde's biography, &c.; Illustrations are plentiful and superb, with many in color, illustrations from the book, photographs of Oscar Wilde and his chums and lovers and enemies, various pictorial representations of the book's title character, and many of Aubrey Beardsley's irreverent illustration for SALOME.I enjoy the novel as a novel. It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition. I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner. Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path. Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read. It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic. loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot.I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?\" he asked, looking at her across the table. \"A great many, I fear,\" she cried. \"Then commit them over again,\" he said gravely. \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\" Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.Punctuality is the thief of time.Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure.You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.Anybody can be good in the country.To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing. A tale of corruption and a cynic man are the eesence of the story that has captivated generations. Read it. When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an `immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a `spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray. It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \"expressing,\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \"let it all hang out.\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \"as easy and graceful as ever.\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \"the end of the century\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO- The Picture of Dorian Grayby Oscar WildeOriginally Published in 1890.Grade: B+Roughly, this novel can be cataloged as a \"Transgressional Fiction.\" A main character, Dorian Gray, leads a hedonistic life, believing that a life serving senses and beauty is the most ideal way to lead one. The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that `Ugliness is the only reality.'\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that `All art is quite useless\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled `useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \"All art is quite useless,\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called `Aesthetic Movement,\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\"\"`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\"\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\"\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"To define is to limit.\"\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\"\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth. Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many. The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read. I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side. This book is a classic for a reason, and this particular edition is excellent because there are notes and explanations as well as discussions of the trials of Wilde for indecency. I found it fascinating and thought-provoking. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially those interested in historical cultures. One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in `The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age. The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \"preaches\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people. The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \"portrait\" in our minds as well. I knew the story and had seen the films but never read the book. Worth while read of a classic. I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \"off the rails\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book. Dorian Gray realizes in the winter of his life that he has been deceived by hedonistic philosophies of Lord Henry and thereafter he succumbs to the depravity of his lifestyle. The unadulterated pursuit of pleasure leaves every man desperately empty. Oh that Dorian would have sought the Lord Jesus who will remake a man despite his past. This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece. Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. . The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \"curse\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time. The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \"must-read.\" this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short. The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy My mother had recommended this book to me awhile ago, saying though she'd never read it, I'd probably like it. I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \"Importance of Being Earnest.\" And his \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away! There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading. This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. I had heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, I knew what it was about, but I never imagined it was going to be such a good book. At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \"revealing\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far. I have read this book in my AP English class in high school and this is be far on my top 5 favorite books and an easy read. What can you say? This book was as good when I read it this time as it was when I read it twenty years ago. Oscar has it going on with this one. The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing. This is a great classical novel. I enjoyed it very much and I am certainly looking forward to keep reading Wilde's works. Excellent book! A classic. I read this in high school and did not pay to close attention to the details and the wisdom surrounding this story, but now that I have lived a few more years it makes so much more sense.... This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\" Oscar Wilde never disappoints. His plays are amazing & so is his only novel, \"The picture of dorian gray\". This is one of my favorite classics novels. Wilde's vivid details captured my intrest from the very first page. The characters were well developed, the ending was great. Overall, this is a must read book! It has everything from suspense, romance, drama, to art. I would definitely have to read it again sometime. Maybe it'll be the first book I ever re-read. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy! Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. I thought it was good, I don't know why people are saying it was boring. Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think. I have read the book and realy enjoyed it. I also have the DVD of it. You realy must get both. I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one. Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye! Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up. This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out. While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \"phew\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic. I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral! Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book. Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \"tragic ending\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be. As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic. Hello? The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities. The writing style was absolutely maddening!The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \"classic\")After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore. Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying. Bottom line: Boooooooooooooring! First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Wow...I had been under the impression prior to reading the novel that this was one of the great works of Western Literature in the past 200 or so years...Never have I been so dissapointed. While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf... Wilde gives us fabulous quotes and a delicious hedonistic storyline, with as always a sence of humor - pleasure to read. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing. Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman Excellent read of classic literature.

I truly great read and a classic that has stood the test of time. The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator. Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading. Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall. I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \"Penguin\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \"Pocket Book\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \"Japanese effect\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap. I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read! I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read. Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through... Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also. This was a great book chalk full of meaning. I liked how Dorian had both good and bad influences about him, yet he succumbed to one and destroyed the other. This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. The novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life. I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young. This book is simply amazing. It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read. This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of `relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of those stories that your supposed to and not supposed to read at the same time. You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting. All the great reviews speak for themself! It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book! This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate. I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point. Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading. Wonderful book; vanity is a terrible thing. Read this book, the classics are worth reading especially when you don't have to. The preface is missing which is a critical to the book! Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise! Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended. I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift. When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic and amazing. I have read this about three times already and still enjoy every minute of it although the hints of homosexuality kind of through me off. This free classic version for my Kindle was very good! It's the first Oscar Wilde tale I have read and I found it to be reader-friendly, engrossing and surprising at the end. Rich characters, nice flow and if you don't know anything about the story I think you'll be having a hard time putting this one down. I've heard the name of topic brought up enough in life to recognize the title but was blessed with no spoilers being laid out and I was surprised at how engrossed I was with this read. I usually am weary about picking up classics because i don't like to get lost in the language but Mr. Wilde is clear and concise in his descriptions and His characters were very personable and interesting.I say READ IT! READ IT NOW! This was so intersting you do not want want to put down, very much a book you can get lost into Beyond just the text, this edition gives a wonderful overview into the full cultural context of Oscar Wilde's original work, and all the influences that resulted in its changes. First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \"yearly re-read\" shelf for certain. First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. A book for all time. This is a piece we could all use to search the places in our souls that need careful review and study. Probably Oscar Wilde's greatest work that continues to live on. Oscar Wilde's only novel is, in my opinion, his greatest work. While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be. The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \"musings\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read. What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned. This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...) The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail fortwo years. He left England and moved to France where he died at avery young age. What a loss? I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought. It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT. The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel. It is a tale of moral decadence and debauchery. Dorian seems consumed in his self portarit, his love for himself is so big that he cannot see beyond his image and when his true image dawns on him he dies. However i did not give him five stars because of the way the plot moves. It is a little bit slow and only at the end you feel it taking full force. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? In the course of his career Oscar Wilde, an Irish writer and poet known for his epigrams and more notably as one of the most popular playwrights in London in the late 1800's, wrote only one solitary novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \"beauty for beauty's sake\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy. This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else. While the plot and subplots take many twists and turns, they are easy to follow. The uncanny &#34;ability&#34; of the portrait is very intriguing. Watch the movie after reading the novel."

         "I found Process Mastering to be a very valuable resource. The book is well written and straight forward in describing how to develop a process master.In my field of information technology (IT), it is critical for progam designers to have a baseline of how a program presently works. This is best done by a representative team of end users. I have found process mastering the most economical and efficient way to get a document that describes the current system. By doing a process master the team becomes empowered to improve the present process without the IT people and to know what else they want or need IT to do for them. Additionally, the team becomes more effective in their participation in the joint application development (JAD) with the IT folks.The philosophy behind the approach is very empowering to employees since it is they, the people who do the work, who develop the process masters. I am also pleased with the emphasis that the book puts on understanding the needs of internal and external customers.Finally, I can recommend this book to anyone who has processes they want to improve and who sees the value of engaging the energy, thought and commitment of their employees to do it. This book, this process, is truly liberating even to the extent of giving meaning and value to previously mundane work."

         "From Russia, With Love",
         "Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are certainly not the mixed bag that the films are, but some are certainly better than others. From Russia with Love is, along with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, among the best.From Russia with Love starts off on a different foot than most of the other Bond novels. Bond himself doesn't appear until part two, 95 pages into the story. Until then, the story centers on the deadly operatives of SMERSH, Soviet Russia's spy-killing organization. It's this first part that sets up the main plot of the story--a Russian scheme not only to assassinate James Bond, but to do so in a way that will scandalize the English public and shame the Secret Service. One of the more famous Bond girls, young Tatiana Romanova is suckered into posing as \"bait\" for Bond, and unbeknownst to her, both she and Bond are set up to die at the hands of Irish psychopath Red Grant.With those pieces in place, the plot proceeds methodically from point A to point B. Fleming was never a master plotter, but that's not the point. Having all the parts set up and ready for action generates enormous suspense--when, for instance, is the serial-killing Grant going to make his inevitable and violent appearance? Even for those who have seen the film version, there's plenty here to surprise and lots of white-knuckle thriller chases, fights, bombings, and near-misses.The book does have flaws. Bond is a bit too obtuse and more of a pawn than usual, and Tania is just a bit too wide-eyed and innocent, which I suppose is the point. But the book moves so briskly from the opening setup through the building suspense and action that one hardly has time to criticize the characters--the world is moving just as fast for them.From Russia with Love is one of Fleming's best not only because of his signature pace and action, but because, in this novel, he takes the time to develop menacing villains and show us, before Bond ever steps onstage, just how dangerous they are. The androgynous Rosa Klebb and giant, moon-crazed Red Grant are well-developed and certainly among the best of Bond villains.On a final note, upon reading this novel have Doctor No, the book's immediate sequel, on hand, because Fleming's ending is so abrupt and laden with ambiguity that you'll want to jump right into the next book. This is either a weakness or a strength. I'll go with strength.Highly recommended. As I watched the last 007 movie I couldn't help but want more....quick read now I want more James Bond. Fully one-half of the way through \"From Russia With Love\", by Ian Fleming, the reader awaits the first action scene - related to the main theme of the book, the nasty spy intrigues and assassinations of the Cold War. How \"007\" and Fleming got their images and reputations from this book is beyond me.Yes, during the first half of the book there is a brilliantly executed build-up, a plenitude (too much perhaps?) of minute detail (especially the faces of the characters), and promises or hints of something more (hopefully some action or intrigue) to come.The classic, 1950's-1960's settings in Moscow, London & Istanbul are fun to read. Since I visited each of those cities in the very early 1960's, I was amused and pleased at the accurate depictions.As Bond and the fem fatale Tanya depart Istanbul on the Orient Express, the pace picks up, thankfully. Actually for the first 80% of the story, the hero and main character is MI5's Istanbul officer Kerim, a Turk. Up to that point, Bond is a minor character, strangely nave, notably uncertain, and only an eager, bumbling follower.For the most part, except for many oft-repeated pet phrases, it's well-written, this story. Bond improved in the last 20% of the story, becoming somewhat the \"Bond, James Bond\" we know from all those movies. It is possible that the movies (which we have all seen at least 4 times) gave us a truly false picture of 007?All-in-all, Bond, as a cold war spy, disappoints through almost all of the story as a mistake-prone, super nave, very gullible and ineffective officer the realm. One must endure the book for the denouement scene on the train. The final few pages are almost laughable and quite unsatisfying.I give it a weak 3.00 on Amazon's scale, if only out of respect for Fleming's body of work and as a thank you for creating the character of James Bond. But make no mistake, \"From Russia with Love\" is wholly disappointing. This is the first Bond book that I have read, and I have to say that it wasn't a very good first impression.Bond spends the majority of the book. He is talked about, and he watches the action happen around him. Towards the end of the book he finally becomes somewhat active, however he misses every clue that he is given. WHen the bad guy finally makes an appearence - after sooo much was told about him at the start of the book, his entire history - he only spends a short amount of time in the action of the book. He reveals the entire plan to Bond, and then is of course killed by Bond. Not because Bond is super cool, but because Bond is super lucky.Of course the woman, the \"heroine\" spends the entire book either making love to Bond or sleeping, but I never expected anything more.Overall, I'm not sure what the appeal of Bond is, but maybe as a friend suggested, I picked the worst one out of the Bond books. I find nothing wrong with formulaic spy books, but this was bad. Oh yes, those beautiful Russian girls and their decoders can really tie you into knots. Isn't that right Mr. James Bond? From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight. Fleming does a great job introducing us to all of the characters in this novel. Like the movie this novel allows us to see Bond as a secret agent, not a superman saving the world. A must read for all Bond Movie fans. This is one of my favorite James Bond books. I read it as a child and I recently repurchased it for the Kindle to reread it. I still own all of the original paperback books but they are so fragile that I am afraid to read them as I fear they may come unbound.I liked this book a lot because of the detailed plot by SMERSH and their plans to entrap Bond and kill him. The assassin is a master killer with a devious and detailed plan to complete his mission. I won't ruin the story for you but you probably already know it from reading the book before or watching the movie.I think that Ian Fleming was at his best writing when he wrote this book. I feel that in his mind the Bond character was fully developed as well as the hated of the Russians for Bond who always seemed to be able to thwart their devious plans with his skills. This story is solid and well written with love, romance, murder, trickery and suspense in it. I truly enjoyed this story and it is one of my favorites. If you are a James Bond and Ian Fleming fan then this is a must read for you. Even the ending is dramatic! From Russia, with Love has a great plot and is well written. Fleming has a great way of portraying his characters. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I read it twice."

Oh, hate this and that, lets hate all the Hindu and all the Jews and all the Buddhists and all the Mulisms and even Catholics and some Protestants but just not Patty!- Patty actually proclaims that \"he can communicate to God\", basically you know he is right there insulting Him by preaching all the blasphemy and hatread.- Patty is absoutely 100% sure he is going directly to heaven without question, at least that's what he wants people to think that he is! And fool people into feeling free to drink and cuss and harm others just as long as they \"find God\" at the very last second.

         "Jane Eyre (New Windmill)",
         "Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \"fairy tale\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \"blindness\" in the novel. First, he is \"blind\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \"plain\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \"stuck in the mud\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic. This was fun as a romance novel, without the really steamy parts! It is always interesting to read books that were written before electricity. The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies. This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics. I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!! Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though. Jane&iexcl;s courage, self-respect and independent helps her towards to her life and overcome all the difficulties, finally obtain her life and her true love. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down even for a second.I loved the writing style and the depth of the characters. I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \"mad wife in the attic\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \"hero\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \"Jane Eyre\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\"Jane Eyre\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester. This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist. This book surprised me not having pages long descriptions of nature and place, which I like. The story is exciting, eventful and sends a great message about love, respect and God. I really enjoyed it... also because it is written in beautiful old English. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. horrible book specially bcuz the language was weird. i remcommend this book to old fashioned people. la la la la Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel. (...) This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (\"manly\" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The \"I heard your voice in the wind\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century! Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!! it is true that many would consider the language in here outdated. I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts. i had no problems with my order and it was delivered very quickly. thank you. i will be looking here first when i need to order books next semester This was an adorable little book that was very affordable. I loved the look and antique feel. The book mark was also a nice touch. I read this book years ago and wanted to read it again. I couldn't remember much about the story. I really enjoyed it, even though some of the language of that time was hard to follow at times. I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \"classic\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \"quick read\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there. Although I would consider Jane Eyre herself plain I definitely would not consider this novel that. This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \"Amphigorey,\" among others. There weren't so many as to be distracting; only enough to make you anticipate one as the story reached an important turning point. Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a bit of contemporary art with their classic lit. Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read. I chose the book for a school project and was honestly not expecting to enjoy the read. I was pleasantly surprised to find a book that was relatable and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down. No well-read person should miss out on this classic. Completely has no detectable flaws in my point of view. Totally seems like the writer is a great writer. :) I had always wanted to read this after seeing the old movie from before I was born (I'm 59). It tells so much more of Jane Eyre's life a as a young girl. It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years. Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style. This book misrepresents itself. We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \"Peek inside\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear. I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \"coincidences\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey. Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature. Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book. Enjoyed this book so much. Very readable and engaging.It may have been written long ago, but is still enjoyable. I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud. I have always wanted to read the classics. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel. Although this book's words are quite hard to understand, the plot of this story is amazing. I am only 13 years old but I enjoyed this book loads. I recommend it!!!!!!!!! I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . . I absolutely loved this book. Jane's character is one that you just keep pulling for because you genuinely care what happens to her. She has a strong will and is the type of protagonist that I find inspiring. Although this is by no means a quick, light read I think that if you're a fan of the classics this is one that you need to add to your \"must read\" list. I look forward to rereading it!

And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \"Jane Eyre\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story. This is my favorite book. The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque. I've read it 4 times and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Always want to change what happens...and always imagine a healed Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \"Reader, I married him\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.' I'd been wanting to read Jane Eyre for quite some time. I even had a copy in my possession. The problem was that it was a boring edition. I couldn't get into it.All that changed when I saw this illustrated version on a shelf. The feel was amazing; the pages, the illustrations, the text-- everything came to life.I definitely recommend this edition to any Jane Eyre fans or those simply wishing for livelier way to enjoy this novel. I'm hoping she does more illustrated editions in the future. Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \"syrupy-ness\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while. Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \"passionate\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \"coincidences\" which might have been classed as \"providence\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \"coincidences\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop. I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte. I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, `Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes. This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over. Jane Eyre has been my favorite novel since I was 12 years old and every single time I read it again it just gets better and better. If you like reading good mysteries, biographies, and romance than Jane Eyre is your book. Charlotte Bronte spectacularly captures the emotions and feelings of the characters and creates a strong and independent lead.It's just wonderful, amazing, and the best book I've ever read.What are you doing reading this... you should have downloaded Jane Eyre and started reading it already. I bought this book because I was interested in the author after being compared with her in my own writing. first person is not the way I write, but Charlotte Bronte did a great job and the book is a good read. I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience! I read this book as a teenager and enjoyed it. As an adult I love it.If you like historical romantic fiction you will enjoy Jane Eyre. JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\" This is a classic love story that you can't go wrong with. Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts. In many ways, `Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of `good' over `evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote `Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith Jane Eyre is a great classic novel. It was a pleasure to re-read it after many years.Would highly recommend. 4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \"The Eyre Affair\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :) I did not realize the \"collector's library\" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read. I have only seen the movie and I find much to my delight that th book far surpasses Hollywood's version. I can not believe that I never even considered taking the time. Now I intend to read as many of the classics as I can. Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius! Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful. The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!! I first read this in college, and didn't fully appreciate it at the time. But I have since read it several other times, and it has become a treasured favorite. An old classic that I had largely forgotten. I enjoy the words that are no longer used and the chance with the kindle to look up definitions easily. I read Wuthering Heights in high school and loved it, but never read any more of the Bronte sisters. Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \"busy\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!! I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story. I am 14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre). all the review's here say \"ooo u can't appreciate this as a teenager\". u know what??? i'm a YOUNG teen, and i can appreciate the romance in this story. the only thing is... idk it's heart wrenching in some parts but other parts its just... boring! i was forced to read this for a book report. whoever thinks we don't understand the romance then ur wrong because today's teenagers grow up quickly what w/ all the media and etc. we do understand. we might not take it as seriously but we do understand it. don't diss us and say this book is too difficult for us. my teacher would not have recommended this it us if she thought we were too ignorant to understand it. This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too. My emotions were all of the place with this book. I consisted of well placed imagery and overall events. I believe I actually cried a few times, especially towards the end. I'm can truly and honestly say that I loved this book and I'm glad I had to read it for my AP English class. Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book. You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status. How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book. This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre. I had to read this for English and its my new favorite high school book. I highly suggest it, mainly for girls. Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \"Jane Eyre\" doesn't come close to \"Wuthering Heights,\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written. &#34;I am a free person...&#34; I love this book. This had not been the first time I had read the book but definately different especially since it was the first time that I read it in digital format for the first time. Through this book I found out that I like the digital format; definitely not better than paper but nice on the train. I bought this book to try to relate to old classic books but it was boring and I didn't even finish it. But that is just me and I don't like these types of books, but it was free, and you might like it, so it can't hurt. brave jane, my favorite of the first person heroines. not a beauty - thank god, isnt that a relief! - but plain and puny and with an indomitable spirit. she chooses morality, in a line which i cant forget: \"and there i plant my foot.\" For rules are not made for when times are easy, or to be discarded when they are inconvenient, but are there as a lifesaver for when emotions and life are in disarray. Great book, a real page turner. After reading many of Jane Austens novels I was told to try the Bronte sisters and it was definitely worth it!! This classic is witty and thought provoking. The plot is twisty enough to entertain the most experienced reader; you may guess the ending but not the path to it. Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition, Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \"Wuthereing Heights\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read. first read Jane Eyre when I was fifteen. It was such a wonderful joy to my then teenage mind full of dreams of love one day.Rereading it every now and then it takes on new understanding each timeThe language would be difficult for teens today (no lol or texting talk!!) But I hope some will try-it is a very good storyAll in all I loved it all over again!! This is my favorite love story ever and it's the third time I've read it. As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids. I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story. Got it to give as a valentines gift, but ended up keeping it! Very beautiful. Classic When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again. I loved Jayne Eyre as a young girl and read it many times but had not tried it as an adult. It turned out to be just as captivating for me now as it was then. Loved the insights in Charlotte's writing. It was such a pleasure to read and I was sad when I came to the end but not sad about the way it ended. Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it. A true classic! Well worth the read. If you are tired of modern novels with too much sex and violence try reading the classics Jane Eyre is a great place to start. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties. Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults. This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre. I love Barnes and Nobles Classics books. The quality of these books are very nice. I will continue to buy them. I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males. Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like. It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I have been passionate about Jane Eyre for going on twenty years now. It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \"martyrdom\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever. The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back. I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \"classics,\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name) It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then. For all you out there who aren't very big fans of classical literature, I assure you that this book will not disappoint. This is a beautiful love story that isn't too hard to understand as far as classic books go, and is well worth the effort. I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not. I am 41 years old and have read this book four times, about once a decade. An absolute must read for anyone who loves serious reading, and sorry, Jane Austen, but Charlotte Bronte rocks the house in ways you never could! i normally dont go for the books that take alot of thinking but this book is now one of my favorites. it is a perfect combination of romance and mystery. for sure a great read i highly recomend! Have wanted to read Jane Eyre for a long time. Have found the novel worth the time as well as in the populist and feminist perspectives. Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99. Though this makes skipping back easy when your listening to it in the car, it might reek havoc on your MP3 player. The box is thin cardboard, and the CD's come in thin paper sleeves. If you haven't read it, you're in for a quiet explosion. Just think about when Bronte wrote this and wonder where...WHERE...in the world did this woman get all of her insight? I cannot recommend this enough. I have several copies of this novel & it's one of my favorites of all time. I will read & re-read always. \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \"Gone with the Wind\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \"Wuthering Heights\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light* I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story! I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures... I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest. I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly. This is my all time favorite read! The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!

Definitely a must-read. I am not much of a reader. I waited 58 years to read this book. It is my daughter's favorite book and I finally read it at her urging. Well it is wonderful. The story has so many twists and turns and is so well told. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I read it on my phone and appreciate being able to read the Kindle version free. Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine. The novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is a timeless story of an orphaned girl. The story of Jane Eyre begins with a look into her unpleasant life while living with her cruel aunt and cousins. To escape her family, Jane escapes to a school in which she spends eight years. Upon leaving Lowood, Jane decides to better her life by becoming a governess. She takes this position at a place called Thornfield Hall where she teaches a young girl named Adele.This novel is well interpreted to show the struggles of an orphaned girl. It also demonstrates how much courage a woman can have in their life even though things may seem impossible.This book is likely to appeal to an older age group. The language is difficult to understand at times and younger people may have trouble staying interested just because the novel is extremely descriptive. An older age group would probably have enough patience to let the splendor of the story unfold. It's also a longer story of 456 pages in which really could have been written well in half the length. Though there were a few minor changes in this version, it definitely does not alter the spirit of the great narrative, nor does it inhibit the reader's comprehension. Given the fact that it is a free edition, this is a fantastic vessel toward familiarity with a true classic. This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane. This book is a great book for those that love stories about love, duty, and the Victorian era. I loved Jane Eyre's character because it was the typical heroine from this time in British History. She is dutiful and proper despite her low circumstances. I love Victorian novels because they always have a happy ending! I LOVE this edition! It has so many helpful explanations in the back - it's a fantastic work of a beautiful, beautiful book. I have several copies - this is my favorite - hands-down.My only criticism is the ribbon - it unravels too easily. Bind the end of it so it doesn't do that. If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school! So glad I re-read this classic. Reading it 40 years after the first time opened my eyes to aspects of history and the beauty of this classic that I didn't see the first time. I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book. Thios book has meaning suprizing twist and turn. It makes you feel sorry for Jane everything that happens to her. Charlotte wrote this book as if she were Jane. It simply amazing. It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!! This is a very ssuspensefull and emotionally enrapturing book. I suggest it to anyone looking to read a great book.God Bless ~Amy Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)"

         "Crossing: A Memoir",
         "This is the story of one Donald McCloskey, a biological male who went on to become a full transsexual. He is now a transsexual as well as a widely published economist. I learned a lot from this memoir about the life of a transsexual who started out as a married, heterosexual cross-dresser. He erotically cross-dressed before becoming a transsexual.I was hoping for a more theoretical framework. For example, there is NO mention of the major kinds of transsexuality. There is absolutely NO mention whatsoever of autogynephilia or of homosexual transsexuality for that matter. None. I also wondered about Deirdre's sexual life post-operatively, as I am sure other readers did.I liked the photographs of Don and Deirde both pre- and post-operatively.The narrative is a little hard to read because of all the bold face, mixed with regular face. I think this was meant to emphasize McCloskey's transsexual verus heterosexuality identity.Despite the book's inherent limitations, I would recommend McCloskey's interesing memoir to anyone seriously interested in transsexuality. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone looking for a more formal treatment of either autogynephilia or homosexual transsexuality. I found Deirdre's memoir refreshing, honest, and insightful, as well as humorous. Deirdre is not an author who takes her self too seriously, though dealing with personal experiances that are both serious and painful.Her story brought back memories of my childhood. My mother was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic and institutionalized when I was 7 years old.I highly recommend this book. It does have some &quot;mild profanities&quot; such as &quot;jeez&quot; and &quot;God&quot; (used litely in the beginning, but it turns into a heart felt prayer) I was utterly fascinated by the author's transformation. At the start of the book we meet Donald McCloskey, a noted economist, as well as husband, father, and professor. We also learn that he is a compulsive cross dresser who walks around casually in women's clothing and heavy make up--at home. In his 50s, Donald had a major life epiphany and decided to become a transsexual. He has \"the works\"---breast implants, electrolysis, facial feminization, female voice surgery, and sex reassignment surgery. The results are evident in the photographs (before and after) in the center section of the book. \"Deidre\" is a tall, blond, large-boned transsexual. Arms folded, legs crossed, \"Deirdre\" is not exactly my image of the womanly ideal. But judge for yourself.I found the author's literary style a bit unnerving. All those bold \"thoughts\" made me wonder who was speaking---Donald or Deirdre the Transsexual? American jokes often begin with &quot;You know that someone or something is ... if ...&quot; and the list goes on. I will not build up such a list on McCloskey's book, (anyway, I do not try to be funny either) but rather give you one personal reason why I loved it.The author, at first, convinces you that her crossing is truly a &quot;state of being&quot; and not what most of us would take as some sort of obscure fantasy. The reader is then &quot;sympathetic&quot; to her in the very first meaning of the word: I understand and I suffer with you, especially as things go wrong with her surgeries and with her family.But here come the mixed feelings: is she not responsible for being rejected by her wife and her children? For instance, was she not expecting too much from her daughter when signing &quot;Deirdre and Dad&quot; at the end of one letter ? Was &quot;Dad&quot; only not more appropriate to show that her new physical appearance changed nothing about the love she has for her daughter?At the end, the reader cannot help but ask himself where would he likely stands in all this and long after finishing the book he would think and think over it again. As for me, this is a sure way to recognize &quot;a great book&quot;.Finally, the book is well written and it is hard to skip a single page when you put both your mind and your feelings into it, which is surprisingly easy once you began to read it. This is a great read. There aren't many trannsexual memoirs as honest and riveting as McCloskey's whirlwind tour, from married heterosexual to avowed transsexual.My main complaint is straightforward. This memoir does not elaborate on contemporary scientific theories on the origins of transseuxality. Odd for a book that purports to be part memoir, part social science. I was hoping to find more information on autogynephilia--either an affirmation or denunciation of the concept. Where does McCloskey stand on this subject? He writes about gender as if it were disconnected from sex. How true is this in real life?Despite the book's inherent limitations, it's a great read and suitable for a general readership."

         "Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day: Proven Secrets of the Potty Pro [toilet training]",
         "I bought this book for my daughter thinking it was another with a similar title that I'd used to potty train her sister almost 35 years ago. Still, when it arrived, I kept it and looked through it. The approach was similar to the book I thought I was buying, but seemed more complicated and, frankly, a little over the top. (Potty parties with princess, super hero or other themes??!)I'm sure the approach works well, but in today's economy I wonder how many families could afford the cost, which if you calculate the price of the potty doll (between $45 and $65) plus the recommended videos, books, treats, party decorations, etc could easily run several hundred dollars! There were some good ideas the book,but I'm afraid this grandmother prefers the simpler, less expensive approach ofToilet Training in Less Than A Dayby Azrin and Foxx. It was ok. I have a special needs child and wish it had more info to help. Needless to say, we're still in diapers. He now goes every morning and most nights before bed, but still wets throughout the day. We've used this book as our method for potty training all three of our kids, our oldest, a girl, was successfully potty trained at 2 1/2 (Teri gives guidelines to check for readiness, so don't assume that 2 1/2 is too early, nor that 3 1/2 is too late - let your child's development level guide you - that's tip number one!). Our two boys, a couple years apart, also potty trained with this method.I will say this, plan for a marathon day. We were literally physically EXHAUSTED after the training party day, but the lesson stuck every time. (Tip #2, get the doll she suggests, one that pees on command!)With our daughter, we had concerns about whether to interrupt the day for her nap, and we emailed the author, who includes her email address. How surprised were we when the next day we got a phone call from Teri herself! We talked for about 1/2 an hour, she gave us great advice (skip the nap, the day will be busy and that's the point, plus early bed time!) I absolutely CANNOT guarantee that she'll call you, but we were blown away that an Author would do that!SIMPLY PUT: Buy this book. Read it. Even if you don't follow it to the proverbial T, you'll get good advice that you can use when you (and your wee one(s)) are ready. I bought this book after my best friend and my son's pediatritian reccommended the techniques used by Terri. I soon learned that my bigest battle for potty training my son was my readiness not his. What an eye opener. So after having my husband take the parent readiness test, we discovered that it would be better if he threw my son his potty party. And I am happy to say it worked! Since we had the party a month or so ago we have only had a couple of accidents (too preocupied) and have just conquered the overnight step, and my son is 3years and 3 months, yeah! I have to also note that I am doubly impressed with Terri. My best friend has had a terrible time, and I mean drag out, knock down, in tears terrible time with her son (same age as mine). So with nothing to loose I emailed Terri and to my surprise she called me back to give more help and suggestions. Needless to say my friend is relieved that even if things don't go smoothly, there are still ways Terri can help. Terri has so much compassion and concern for both parent and child. I never thought that I would have such an amazing expireince from just one book! I was very skeptical that my son could be trained in one day. However, my girlfriend swears by Crane's methods, so I got the book, purchased all necessary items, and threw a superhero-themed potty party. It was EXHAUSTING! But, my son had a lot of fun. After 3 days (not one), my son was potty trained and stopped having accidents. In the end, I think the potty party is worth all the fuss because you don't drag out the pull ups, diapers, and training for months and months. It sends a clear message to the child to pee and poop on the potty and not in a diaper anymore. I saw this book at Barnes & Noble on sale and immediately sat down with my laptop to check the reviews before buying it. Based on those, I thought \"what the heck\" and bought the book. I had been working with my daughter on potty training (admittedly sporadically and not with a consistent method) for 9 months. She was 2 1/2 when I first started with her and about 3 and 3 months when we had her potty party. We went for the princess theme and I have to say, even if the concepts in the book hadn't worked, it would have all been worth it for the look on her face when she woke up to her party and the experience we had bonding as mother and daughter without all of the other family members in the house. I will say that it took extensive preparation in getting all of the decorations purchased, making arrangements to be alone in the house for the day and I felt like I was cramming for a college final the night before the party to make sure I was saying the right things and doing it all in the right order. But it was worth every effort and dollar spent. She went from going potty in the toilet 2 or 3 times over the course of MONTHS and just not being interested in it AT ALL to going 5 times on the day of the party with ZERO accidents. She is still using pull-ups at nap and bed time, but I don't care. She's had a handful of accidents in the month since we had the party and I don't care about that either. We used the Fisher Price musical princess potty and bought a doll that looks like a toddler to train her with. My only complaint is that the author suggests dolls to use for the party that look like babies...with bottles. Uhm, if you're going to use a doll to potty train your toddler, shouldn't the doll look like your toddler? With that being said, the only toddler-looking doll that potties on the market (that I could find anyway) would wet her pants as soon as you had her drink something. Oh well, that just created more opportunities to talk with my daughter about using her \"potty training memory muscles\" after we have an accident. If you've never heard a 3-year-old say \"potty training memory muscles\" then buy this book if for no other reason than that. :) I took the survey in the book and found out my child is not ready for potty training yet. It was a big help. This book was our lifesaver. I purchased the book a couple of months before I began to potty train my son. He was just approaching his 3rd birthday and started to show some interest in the potty. I went through the checklist \"Are they Ready to Potty Train\" section of the book and it confirmed he was. I did not spend a lot of money as some people mentioned in the past reviews. The only extra money I spent was on the doll \"Paul\" I thought that would really help my son make him seem more real. There was quite a bit of preparation but I was able to create the snacks, drinks, activities and decorations with things we already had at home but it was because I picked a theme with things we already had.... camping. My son already had a play tent, sleeping bag and accessories. I made animal printouts from my computer and drew trees on easel paper and paints we already had in our craft area. I went to the local library and checked out every book and DVD that had to do with potty training. The hassle is mainly just getting everything together. The party went off with out a hitch and by the end of the day he was asking to go to the bathroom without me telling him it was time to go and throwing his diapers away at his end of the day party. I definitely think that this is the way to go with potty training. The day could not of gone better and it also helped my husband and I get into potty mode. :) I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for new ideas to potty train. If anything my son loved didn't even know what we were doing other than spending the day with him mom and dad alone with no interruptions playing make believe camping, \"fishing\", doing scavenger hunts, singing, readying books (about potty training) and finding funny ways to run to the bathroom. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this wonderful book and helping my son realize that he is now one of the big boys! I read this book after talking with two co-workers who had fantastic success with the potty party method. It sounded a little too good to be true, but given their success, I had to go for it. (I'd also had the opportunity to see the author speak at our daughter's day care, and I loved the fact that she was a real person; but that's not really relevant.) We picked a three-day weekend to throw a party for our 25-month old daughter. She'd shown great signs of readiness, but I was still a little skeptical that this would work. I shouldn't have worried. The weekend was great. She loved the party, got completely into the potty (stickers and treats were a big incentive) and after hitting the two week mark today, she's accident free during the day. We're still having some trouble at night, but I'm not discouraged. I do have to say, though, that following the no-diaper rule is key. Do NOT cave. One other point about this author in particular: I was incredibly nervous about our daughter's first day back at day care without diapers. I was so nervous, in fact, that I sent the author a couple of questions through the form on her website. She actually CALLED me with some advice. It was great to feel like I had someone on my side. I have a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy. I used the potty party for my little girl ( at age 2) and she nailed potty training. I was skeptical to use this method on my little boy- everyone kept telling me that he was too young...boys take longer etc. Well, too young or not- he nailed potty training as well using the same method in this book...matter of fact after only an hour and 45 minutes- he was tired of training his doll and wanted his diaper off! I was stunned, I had only trained my daughter according to the book- so I just winged it from that point on...he had a couple of accidents but at the end of the day, he was 7 for 11 at the toilet! The next day was 13 out of 14....and we havent had an accident since! When the book tells you that YOU need to be ready...YOU DO! It is an exhausting day...but totally worth it! If you have other kids- you have to ship them off to the grandparents or a friends house ( I also have a 5 month old) the focus needs to be on the trainee! You can do this....its that easy! I give this book 3 stars because it's one of the most interesting books on potty training I've read, yet its approach wasn't a \"miracle cure\" for my child.I tried Teri's approach with my daughter a week before her 4th birthday. I spent about 6 weeks reading and re-reading Teri's book, taking notes on it, buying items for the party and otherwise preparing for it. I don't think I could have been readier for it than I was.The morning of the party went fairly well. However, I was slightly disappointed in the Emma Corolle doll (the one most recommended by Teri). The bottle leaked, and getting the bottle in the doll's mouth \"just right\" was tricky. So when I would try to feed the bottle to the doll, the doll (and its underwear) would get wet. Also, if the doll's belly was pressed even slightly, the doll would pee. So, we had a number of accidents with the doll that I didn't intend to stage! If I had to do it all over again, I would have bought a cheaper doll with no wetting function, and I would have just pretended it was peeing into the potty by holding a bottle behind it (as Teri did at the party for her own son).The afternoon party was a lot of fun, but it didn't work miracles with my daughter. I never did get her to pee on the potty. She did have two accidents, one of which occurred almost immediately after she'd spent a long time sitting on the potty. Even though my daughter is almost 4, I think she just doesn't \"get it.\" She doesn't understand yet how to control her bladder and pee \"on demand\".So I am a bit disappointed, but I do think we made some progress today. For one thing, my daughter wore underwear for an 8-hour stretch. She's never worn underwear that long before. For another thing, by dedicating the whole day to potty training, I was able to observe how often my daughter absolutely has to pee. These observations should help me in coming days as I try to time my daughter's sessions on the potty \"just right\" to try to catch her when she most has to pee.If I had this experience to do all over again, here is what I would have done differently:- I would have bought a cheap doll with no drink and wet function so I could have controlled its output better;- I would have offered only salty treats to my daughter. I offered both sweet and salty and she chose only sweet. If she'd had only salty things to eat, I think she would have been thirstier and been willing to drink more. Maybe this would have resulted in my daughter making a pee on the potty.- I would have tried to stay within a budget. I think part of my disappointment with the day was spending so much time and money putting together the \"perfect\" party as outlined in Teri's book. Teri makes it clear you don't have to go \"all out\" that way, but having a Type A personality, it was my instinct to do that. In retrospect, though, I wish I wouldn't have gotten so carried away.- I would have been more honest with myself about my daughter's readiness. Conventional wisdom is that, at nearly 4 years old, she should have been trained long ago. But there are a lot of signs of readiness that she is lacking. Above all, she lacks the desire to be thought of as a \"big kid.\" That desire is central to Teri's approach. So, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise to me that the approach didn't work wonders on my daughter who lacks that desire.-- I would have accepted the fact that potty training isn't going to happen with a flick of the wrist and snap of the fingers. Not that Teri says it will, even with her approach. But I have to admit I was hoping that we could rush the process and \"get it over with\" in one day and not have to worry about it much after that. Evidently, that's not how things are going to work, at least for my daughter.So, I do recommend giving Teri's approach a try (with the aforementioned pointers in mind), but I also advocate reading Elizabeth Pantley's \"No-Cry Potty Training Solution.\" It's almost the opposite approach to Teri's, but if you have a child who is a late, reluctant trainer the way mine is, it may be more realistic for your situation. Pantley gives lots of tips for working on potty training gradually over a long period of time. This book has helped us in so many ways! We tried to potty train our son with no success several times. In desperation, I read Teri Crane's book and tried the potty party. Although it initially worked, after the novelty wore off, my son somewhat regressed. I went to the web site and emailed Teri Crane, and she contacted me immediately with many more helpful ideas and suggestions!In the past year I have found invaluable help from the book, especially the back section with information with the experts, and most of all from Teri Crane. She is an author who believes in her product and is willing to help. She has given me, more than anything, empathy, understanding and peace of mind. I can understand where this concept might work for some kids, but I was very disappointed with the results we experienced. My son is 2 1/2 and very interested in the potty. He's been using it every night before bath to pee and poop for several months, so I thought the \"potty party\" would be a great opportunity to encourage him to use it during the day and more regularly. He was SO EXCITED with the party theme and all the decorations and treats. We used a large stuffed Buzz Lightyear as his potty doll and I creatively (and discretely) \"wet\" his underwear and created play-doh poop accidents, as the book suggests. My son was very good at \"teaching\" Buzz that he had to use the potty and rewarding him on his sticker chart and from the treat tray, but he clearly got annoyed with the frequency of having to practice using the potty. He would leave Buzz in the bathroom and go back to the \"party\". After lunch, the prizes, and a nap, he woke up excited to go back to the party and THRILLED to be wearing \"no pants!\", just his underwear. As much as he loved wearing his underwear, and although we had a successful poop and a couple successful pee incidents in the potty, after his third accident he became very discouraged and upset with having soiled his underwear (even as he was doing it, he became very upset.) We told him accidents happen, just like Buzz, and he just had to practice his \"potty memory muscles\" (as per the book's instructions) just like Buzz, but by the 3rd accident he outright refused to even sit on the potty or go in the bathroom. It was quickly slipping into a discouraging experience for him and having an ADVERSE effect on the overall training. Before we risked traumatizing him, we stopped pushing him. The problem was, he took going back to a diaper as punishment, and cried because he wanted to wear the \"soft\" underwear. I managed to coax him into using pull-ups, but in the end, it was very disappointing and I feel that it took us a step backwards. I'll have to wait a while before we can try again. He used to smile and run to use the potty. Now he loses his smile and hesitates, and during the day he simply wants no part of it. My suggestion would be to keep an eye on your child and see how s/he is reacting to the \"potty\" portion of the training, not just the party. I'm in the process now of reading 3 other books on potty training approaches to see which might work better for my son. He still wants nothing more than to wear underwear instead of pull-ups or diapers, so that's a great incentive for us. Good luck. I read 3 other potty training books by so called \"experts\" and none of them worked. This is hands down the best book I read, and more importantly, it worked. If you take the time to read and implement, you will get the results you desire. The concept of the book is something that really interested me. My daughter enjoys parties (especially the hats) so I knew this would work for us. I was excited to spend so much one-on-one time with her as we celebrated this milestone together. I felt my daughter picked up on the ideas of the doll and the rewards very quickly. She was always excited to give her doll a present and a treat and a sticker when she successfully used the potty. When it was my daughter's turn to use the potty, she understood what the whole routine was. I know she had a lot of fun and we had a great time at her celebration that evening where she and some of her friends rode the merry-go-round at the mall. She wasnt 100% potty trained in one day, but she has done excellent pretty much since the party. This was a girl who refused to use the potty before the party turned it into something that was worth while for her to accomplish. The book was a quick read and very to the point, which I appreciated in my busy \"no time to read\" life. I reccomend this book to people who want to celebrate and have fun with their children as they become \"big girls and boys\". My child (2 yrs old) was terrified of the thought of using the potty when we started this program on Friday. Today is Monday and I just called my mother in law who reported that she willingly sat on the potty and made pee pee. This is the sencond time she goes to the bathroom alone today without an incident. Don't get me wrong, by no means would Iconsider my child \"potty trained\" completely, but the book is an amazing start. First of all, my child was terrified of the potty, so by teaching the doll and incorporating the treats, she really lost that fear. Second of all, the book has amazing tips and ways to handle accidents, incentives for using the potty, etc. I highly recommend this book. I followed all of the steps in regards to the doll and the treats and sticker chart. We saw a number of videos and books, but we really didn't spend so much on decorations and all that stuff. She was just content to have me spend the entire day doing all sorts of activities. I picked a princess theme since her potty is princess themed. I got some wands and crowns, picked up a few princess coloring books. I painted her little toes princess pink because mommy is a big girl and has hers painted. Throughout the party we just talked about being a big girl and how exciting it is. When she had accidents she got really freaked out. Kids DO NOT LIKE THAT FEELING. So I said that accidents happen, and its not a big deal, etc. When I finally put her big girl underpants on, she did not pee for 4 hours! I was afraid she was holding it in, so I left an email with the author, and she called me right away to talk me through it. It was so incredibly nice of her to do. I'm very happy! This program is a huge help with all kinds of potty \"isues\", I will definetly be recommending this book to everyone!! Thank youPotty Train Your Child in Just One Day: Proven Secrets of the Potty Pro [toilet training] I bought this book without any thoughts on it taking one day. My son was 2 1/2 when we started. Of course it took us about a couple of weeks but I believe that the premise of this book made that possible. I really suggest that you put alot of planning into the party. We did Dora as the theme and I was able to find \"backpack\" in the gift bag section and used that to hold the \"rewards for using the potty\". I gave the book a 3 because it is hard to train your child in one day but at the cost for the book it is worthy of being in your library! Good luck! I would highly recommend this book to anyone potty training. It really works! And the process was a good bonding experience as well. We did our potty party last Saturday, and one week later we are on day three of ZERO accidents!! My son turns 3 tomorrow and he's the kind of kid who likes to sit and read books and do puzzles so we did not need to struggle with sitting on the potty. I have to admit there were a couple of times on party day that I had my doubts and it was not smooth sailing. But the results have been tremendous, and just as important for me, my son and I are closer than ever and have bonded over the experience. A couple of logistics notes: we used a lot of imagination and not a lot of props so don't worry if you don't think you have the time, creativity or energy (or money) to do the full blown party. M&Ms and Thomas stickers have kept us going through the week! I blogged the full experience of our day at [...] if you want to know more! This book really did help me potty train my daughter! We had our potty party 1 week ago and now she pees mostly in the toliet-maybe a few dribbles here and there! We have yet to poo poo on the potty; but it will happen. I did elimination communication with my daughter early on and she did great. After some major family stresses and moves we stopped. I tried taking her to the potty and she would just fuss and scream; so I left it alone for a few months. My daughter is 23 months old and doesn't talk a lot but she says \"pee pee\" and \"potty\"-so we went for it. I bought her doll at Kmart is was around $15.00; it is not as good as the corelle dolls but it did the trick. We had a \"Princess party\" I bought cheap party favor Tiaras and Disney princess panties. Princess fruit snacks, punch, etc. The first day she had 2 accidents in the morning and 2 pees on the potty in the afternoon. My daughter doesn't really care for stickers yet; but the do entertain her. She really liked M&M's! All of the supplies can seem costly-I got a lot of stuff at TJ Maxx and Big Lots-discount stores! Yesterday we had no accidents; even after a 1 hour trip to the park; she was dry! I highly recommend Pampers Easy ups over Pull ups-My daughter has worn Huggies all her life; but the Pull ups are a rougher material and gave her a rash if she woke up wet. The Pampers Easy ups are great, she likes them and she seems to know if she is wet or not! Great Book; I recommend devoting 3 days to not leaving the house when attempting to train. There are some helpful suggestions in this book.The layout of the book is good for busy parents.The humor the author uses throughout helps ease anxiety about the subject matter.I suggest purchasing some page tabs to secure throughout the book while reading."

         "Sloppy Firsts (Jessica Darling, Book 1)",
         "Jessica Darling goes about her life in her \"just darling\" high school bubble, but inwardly she is screaming for relief from the stupid teenage drama of Pineville High. Her best friend Hope has moved away and left Jessica to battle insomnia, gossip, lack of period, parental expectations, and her older sister's wedding all by herself. To top that, the enigmatic Marcus Flutie - whose reputation reeking of drugs and sex precedes him - becomes inexplicably the one person Jessica can turn to.I've been wanting to read this series forever and finally found all the books at the same time. Jessica Darling is the epitome of a teenager who feels lost amid the high school routine, but doesn't know what she's looking for. Written in journal form, I got sucked into Jessica's honest and snarky observations of the life around. sloppy firsts will definitely appeal to anyone who has ever felt like a freak of nature that no one will ever understand - with Jessica, you'll find good company! I really enjoyed this book. Being a teenager myself (15), i could relate to a lot of the things she felt.The book is really Jessica Darling's journal entries, but not the &quot;Dear Diary&quot; type you'd expect. Her life is complicated when her best friend, Hope, moves far away, and she is left with shallow friends who she doesn't really like. Things aren't any better at home, dealing with her father who only cares about her running, mother who is obbsessed with her sister's upcoming wedding. Both her mother and sister being blonde's, she tends to feel like the &quot;ugly-duckling&quot;.GET THIS BOOK!! it really was a great book, i bet u'll be laughing out loud (i'm not just saying that...i really did!) at how cynical Jess can be at times. I swear, that was me in middle school. I love books that make me happy and sad at the same time, and this was definitely one of them. This book is just amazing, even when you used to be 15 or 16 (but no longer are!). It's very well written and there's lots of action. All characters are well developed, the setting is good, and the storyline is VERY good. And I like the little twist with Marcus Flutie! I love these books. I started reading them when i was 16, and ten years later, I still like them. Funny, honest, and witty. There is no other way to express this compelling novel other than that it was absolutly awsome. At first, it is hard to get a feel for all the characters but after the first 20 pages you are instantly taken into the life of this teen who is way cooler than she realizes. Jessica Darling is stuck in the last semester of sophmore year in high school with out her best friend. You soon learn why hope has moved. I can't say much with out giving the whole story away, but you have got to read it. I absolutlely loves &quot;Sloppy Firsts&quot; and I can not wait to read the follow up novel if their shall be one. I was dissapoined in the end for one reason that you will discover when you read it. Megan McCaferty really makes you fall in love with Jessica Darling (the lead character) and you find yourself missing her when you are done the book. A must read for any highschooler. This book had me rolling on the floor laughing so hard. Omigod! It was like &quot;quote&quot; so like true to life &quot;unquote&quot;. (No I don't really talk like that, I was making fun of a few characters in the book).I can see how some of the things in this book would go right over the head of someone born after 1985. There are a few 80s references that some young teens may not get. This is a great book to read if you are in your late 20s or 30s, although the language and slang sounds like teens today.Jessica is my new hero. I'm still laughing at &quot;vagitarian&quot;. Can't wait to read the sequel. Jessica Darling's best friend, Hope, has just moved 1000 miles away. Hope was more than just Jessica's best friend, she was the only person keeping her sane. Hope's absence makes dealing with her pseudo friends, the ultra popular &quot;clueless crew,&quot; unbearable. Jessica is also having boy trouble. The school's star jock, Scott, wants to date her but Jessica finds herself oddly attracted to Marcus, the school junkie.This is the best teen novel that I've read in ages. Finally a novel about high school life that hasn't been watered down for younger readers. Jessica's bleak and sarcastic narrative about her fellow classmates will appeal to everyone who was miserable in high school. Daria fans will especially enjoy this series. I recommend this book to everyone, even people who can't stand the thought of reading a teen book. This book is extremly funny. You'll want to read it over again, each time a new book for the series comes out. The main character, Jessica, is so funny and cynical, sometimes to a fault. This is a book for girls starting at age 15. The content can be a little racey and there is profanity. Anyone who is looking for a Sarah Dessen-esque book should read this series. Once you turn the first page your hooked. Jessica Darling is a witty honor student, who finds herself in a new light. She's your average high school student, and she goes through drama that all of us have faced, at one point or another. The high school she attends seems average, and has all the normal cliques. This novel was one of my favorites. Megan McCafferty goes into the mind of today's teen and comes out with this amazing character. In the book Jessica starts falling for a &quot;Krispy Creme&quot; a boy who, doesn't seem her type. I think anyone who has been through the drama of high school, would enjoy this book. Other books i would reccomend would be Gossip Girl. The both deal with high school girls, going through the many dramas we face. Young adult fiction is my secret vice. I admit it! Every now and then there's nothing better than a re-read of a childhood favorite, or, as in the case of Sloppy Firsts, the discovery of something new and wonderful. Quite truthfully, I expected Sloppy Firsts to be nothing more than a pleasant romp. I was surprised to find that though the book was immensely easy to read, it was also thoughtful and substantive. Ms. McCafferty manages to touch on so many of the universal strains and pains of adolescence; it seems like one would be hard pressed to find a woman or girl who can't in some small (or large!) way relate to the misunderstood Jessica Darling. If I had to criticize the book in any way, it would perhaps be that it's _too_ perceptive and well-written. As the novel is written as excerpts from Jessica's diary, it's a bit of a stretch to believe that a high-school sophomore would be quite so eloquent and insightful. That tiny little peeve aside, I highly recommend Sloppy Firsts to anyone who has ever been a teenage girl. When I read a describtion of this book ...I was sure I'd love it, so I bought it. The first two pages, I had some doubts but I kept reading and immediatley fell in love. It's so realistic and I think all teenage girls can relate. Its unique, funny, and refreshingly witty! I totally recommend buying this book! Absolutely loved this book! What a gem. Just finished it and cannot wait to read Second Helpings. After even just being halfway through the first book, I went ahead and bought, Second Helpings, Charmed Thirds and Fourth Comings. This book just kept me turning the pages. I love Jessica Darling's voice, Marcus Flutie, etc. This has been one of my all-time favorites! I highly recommend it. I recommended to my daughter-in-law and she read the first three in a couple of days. She's on Fourth Comings now and LOVES them. Awesome job Megan McCafferty This story is not unique. I can be Jessica Darling. You can be Jessica Darling. Any 16-year-old girl in an American high school can be Jessica Darling. In other words, this is relatable material, focusing on a year in the life of a young girl dealing with mostly typical teenage angst. Jessica Darling, a self-proclaimed brainiac, deals with her best friend moving away, and trying to fit in with a group of girls she dislikes. Meanwhile, she struggles with her mother, who is obsessively planning her older sister's wedding, with a sort-of boyfriend, and a head-game happy boy genius who stimulates her intellect and likes her \"as a friend.\"Jessica is wise beyond her years and that appeals to me since I've been out of high school for a VERY long time. It made me wish I were that smart when I was a confused high school girl. Overall I found her take on the world quite entertaining. The writing is fast-paced, crisp, and funny. I'm not sure I'd let my daughters read this, due to the frank outlay of sex and drugs in the plot; however, for more mature readers, it's a bit of a romp into a juvenile, chick-lit world that made me think, \"been-there/done that.\"Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said. Although Jessica Darling may at first seem a bit eloquent and older than her supposed age of 15-16, her quirky view of high school life and the enjoyable rhythm of her words will soon draw the reader in and make her, or him, suspend disbelief. Jessica is devastated by her best friend's move, but still plucky and resigned to carrying on with high school. Her feelings of superiority to her more one-dimensionally characterized classmates are right in line with a real teen view of the world revolving around her and her troubles. It is rewarding to see Jessica grow and realize that the people she takes for granted, such as her mother, a former close friend, and the new girl in school, have more layers than she suspected. Jessica matures throughout the book, and the reader routes for her all the way. Her funny, pithy observations offer insight into the crazy high school merry go round. Her human tendancy to lie is balanced by her strong sense of honor, which shows itself in other ways. Overall, an engrossing, fun read with some depth. I look forward to Sloppy Seconds, or whatever the next Darling title may be. This book is really great. it has just the right mix of humor,love and real life. i could indetify with the girl in this story. i've read &quot;Sisterhood of the travlin pants&quot; but i like this better because its funnier and could actually happen. any teenage girl should really like this book. check it out you wont be disapointed! Jessica Darling's (I know, what a great name) best friend, Hope, moves away and she's stuck around her \"so called friends\" that she doesn't like. Her dad keeps pushing her to keep running while secretly she wants to quit. And then there's Marcus Flutie--the school bad boy and dreg nicnamed krispy creme for always being at a crisp for doing drugs and having \"done\" two dozen girls. She starts having phone conversations with him and he messes with her mind. Jessica is Marcus's first friend that he hasn't slept with. But he knows her better than anyone else, including her \"so called friends\".This book is so funny, Jessica does the dumbest things that make you laugh while you're reading it. Megan McCafferty's voice comes through strong in this book from her vocabulary and all the 80's type words she throws into it like: bubblegum bimbo.Will I reread it?Yes, I adore this series. Yes, it is indeed a series so you don't have to stop at this book.I would probably recommend this to a more older teenage audience because of the language and some of the scenes are pretty graphic. I overall really enjoyed this book and thought of it as a perfect start to a wonderful and unique series. This was a great novel in that there was a very nice mixture of plot and characters fleshed out a little better than paper thin. I really liked Jess, the protagonist. She came off as a real girl, and I enjoyed being inside her head with all her OCD thought and teen-angst worries, gripes and hypocrisies.On the down side, this book is littered with references to sex and not a few expletives. When I was a teen, you had to read Jackie Collins to get this kind of stuff. &quot;Sloppy Firsts&quot; is by far one of the greatest books I've ever read. Megan McCaffery has really outdone herself on this book. I read the entire book in less than a day. I couldn't put it down! The main character in the book, Jessica Darling, is one of the most relatable characters I've ever read about! I give this book 5 stars, as one of the best I've ever read. This was just great! I really liked this. I didn't realize at first, however, that this was written in the form of diary entries and letters. But it well written so it conveyed the story and wasn't written in shorthand (which I hate). Mostly, I found this hilarious. Since it is written in a diary, I think we get the more snarky side of Jessica, while getting the dialogue as well.Jessica was a fun character. I really enjoyed her story. Man, she seems to have some horrible luck! Although Marcus seemed like that kid you shouldn't associate, I found myself liking him and secretly hoping that they would at least become friends. I felt bad for Jessica, after Hope moved away. It seems she really only has the one friend who really gets her and that she truly likes.I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be an insomniac and seeing what goes through Jessica's head was interesting. Her need to run (without her dad there to make it not fun) just to shut off her brain for a few minutes.This was a highly enjoyable book. I have read a lot of good things about it and I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Sloppy firsts is about a teenager going through troubling times just like any ordinary teenage girl would be. Jessica Darling best friend just moved so she is like a fish out of water at school and a stranger at home. She doesn't now how she is suppose to deal with the boy- and shopping crazy girls at school also known as the Clueless Crew, her dad's obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over her big sister Bethany's lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life. I enjoyed this book very much I think it describes a teenage girls life in high school, also me and Jessica had a lot in come due to the fact that she liked track too. This book made it seem like Jessica wasn't just a character she felt like a real person.I recommend this book to 8-12 graders. This book is very mature and I think that this should be taken seriously it is very interesting. If you read it in 7th grade me may not understand what something she says. There is a few curses, and inappropriate descriptions. If you want to read a book about a high school going through problems this is an excellent book! I picked up this book at borders cause it had a cool cover and i wanted something to read on my plane ride home. I can't tell you how happy I was that I did. I couldn't put the book down. Jessica is such a real character because she could be the girl who sits next to me in science or math class. She has real problems and real solutions. I think that the book is witty, humourous, poingant and moving. An impressive debut. Can't wait for the next book. Sloppy Firsts is a great book! Its centers on Jessica Darling and her high school experience. Jessica is trying to find who she is while dealing with her best friend Hope moved away and is now left with her &quot;friends&quot; which she says have no depth. Jessica writes everything in her journal,( which is how the book reads) and deals with high school itself, boys, and friends. It a great funny book! Jessica 'Notso' Darling is the witty, satirical narrator of this epistolary novel. Through a series of journal entries and wistful emails to her long distance BFF, we learn about Jessica's trials & tribulations as a high school student. From being labeled a 'brainiac', being the subject of a tell-all expose, and dashing her father's dreams of an Olympic athelete, Megan McCafferty tackles all of the teenage angst that some of us have experienced and others of us are just buckling into the seat on the rollercoaster.McCafferty has three more books in the Jessica Darling series, and I can't wait to see what's in store for her next! This book was very good. It took me took me on a roller coaster of emotions. But the ending was horrible. and sometimes horrible endings ruin books. This book was very funny yet was very realistic of an every day life of a teenager! I really recommend this book to any teenage girl, it really makes you think about your own life and how some things really don't matter.Again it was a very good book and i hope that every one liked it as much as me! Good book -- I felt like I was back in high school again. I'm glad that Jessica was a &quot;normal&quot; girl. She was most women in high school, and I could completely relate to her. Add to that that my friend called me when I was 2/3 through the book and started talking about our high school reunion that was held the previous night (I didn't attend), and I was right back there in 4th period study hall. A fun read, good escape. this series is absolutely incredible. i picked up the book on a whim, but fell in love with jessica darling and her pineville woes, and eagerly counted down the days till the next two books were released. i havent been able to put down any of these books since the day i got them. i just read them over and over again. i think this shows a side of teenage life that is way more than your typical boy, best friend, and acne drama. it is witty, touching, wise, and just plain REAL. absolutely amazing read- don't pass it up! Megan McCafferty's novel about 16 year old Jessica Darling is one just about every girl can relate to in some way. From the dreams of finding that rare true guy friend (been there!), to the agony of not living up to your parents expectations (yep), unrequited love and unwanted love (yessum), to losing and finding your friends (for sure), this book covers a lot of topics that are just downright normal...but are made incredibly interesting through a variety of humorous situations and intelligent narration by Jessica via her personal journal. McCafferty's book doesn't after-school special teenage-hood, or make it uber boring, or super unbelievable, instead it makes you find the qualities most angsty teenagers have in themselves that relate to Jessica Darling, and draws you in as you look at your own experiences and compare them to Jessica's. (I'm 17 so I can definately relate!). A great effort, I can't wait to read the second book! This book is not like the typical teenage books I have read many times in the past. Full of ironic humor and interesting twists, Sloppy Firsts is a joy to read the whole way through. There's simply never a dull moment in this book. It could really appeal to all age groups and genders. I'd reccomend it to anyone. It's a good book. this truely is the most spectacular book i have ever read. meagan really knows how to write a good book. this will truely capture you for hours at a time. be sure to read this book its great. When I decided to try &quot;Sloppy Firsts,&quot; I was hoping for something along the lines of the Princess Diaries series or even Louise Rennison-tinged humour. What I got was a book about your average American girl who, in her trivial pursuits for hapiness, ends up finding out that she's pretty much been putting herself up for pain from day one.From her &quot;grounded gimphood&quot; to her miserable job at the boardwalk, all the way to &quot;Notso Darling's Agony of Defeat Volues I &amp; II,&quot; Jessica &quot;Notso&quot; Darling stands out as a character, individual in her own right and from those of most teen novels. Her best friend Hope moved away last year and now Jessica is left with the &quot;Clueless Crew,&quot; her so-called friends whom she actually despises. When Hy(acynth) Wallace comes to town, Jessica has high hopes for a friendship. Until Hy steals Jess's slogan &quot;Bubblegum bimbos&quot; and does a book on &quot;icky&quot; small town life.It has some hilarious moments, some touching moments and some very personal moments and I have to give the author credit for making the characters so lovable/loathable. Sloppy Firsts: When Jessica Darling's best friend, Hope Weaver, moves out of Pineville, New Jersey, Jessica's life goes all out of wack. Hope is the only person who understands Jessica's quirky personality. So when Hope moves Jessica is left with nothing. She really doesn't have many friends, except the Clueless Crew (who she secretly hates) and Hy a new girl in school who soon becomes just another member of the crew. The boy that she is in love with doesn't even know she exists and on top of all of that she is a complete stranger in her own house. All her dad talks to her about is running and all of her many track meets and her mother is always busy with her older sister Bethany who is about to get married.Now that Hope is gone a new girl named Hy moves in. Jessica befriends her, but knows that she will never replace Hope. Hy and Jessica soon grow apart as becomes more involved with the Clueless Crew. The crew consists of Bridgett, Manda, and Sara, who are all \"Bubble- Gum Bimbos\" that are self- absorbed shop-a-holics who's only interests are boys and not getting fat. Jessica grows to hate the crew more and more as time goes by, but they have no idea.Jessica has turned into a major insomniac without Hope in her life. Whenever she can't sleep, which is every night, she goes out running in the middle or the night. But she soon is able to sleep again when she befriends Marcus Flutie, a surprisingly intelligent, mysterious drugie from school. She talks to him late at night about things she probably would never even think about talking with Hope. Jessica soon develops feelings for Marcus, but doesn't tell anyone, not even Hope. She soon finds her self lying to the most important person in her life.Jessica becomes alienated from everyone. Not even Marcus fulfills her desires anymore. Her father doesn't speak to her anymore because since she fractured her ankle on one of her midnight excursions they have nothing to talk about anymore. Her mother on the other hand tries to be with her more now that Bethany has left and there is no more wedding to plan. But Jessica just can't stand her mother treating Jessica like she is just another Bethany. Since she is her mother Jessica tries to be nice on her Birthday, but instead of this being a fun filled day it turns into a crying fest when Jessica tells her mother how she really feels about everything in her life. After this wonderful conversation they both understand each other and are willing to give it another try. But now school is almost over for Jessica and Hope will be coming soon and she is prepared to tell Hope everything, even about Marcus.This novel is very humorous and interesting to read, but it also reminds of all the difficulty of growing up. It reminds grown ups of all the hardships they had to go through in high school, like being popular and looking good for all the boys or girls at school. It is a wonderful teen book, especially when they are going through some of the changes that Jessica had to go through. It also should be read by adults and parent to remind them of the old days and try to understand their teens a little bit more. this was one of the better books I've read in a long time. I actually laughed out loud and have passed this book on to several friends who have also loved it. \"Second Helpings\" the conclusion (how I hope not, I adore Jessica \"Not-so\" Darling) is also just as enjoyable. Still giggling about \"Bubblegum Bimbos and Assembly-line Meatballers\" A fantastic book that womem of all ages should read. I couldn't put it down from the moment I read the first line. This would make a wonderful TV show or movie! Who wouldn't want to watch Jessica Darling through the rest of her journey into adulthood? Such a great book. McCafferty's sense of humor is great. Even though her main character is a high school student, almost anyone can relate to her experiences (or at least remember what they were like).I'm almost thirty and loved it. The friend that recommended it is in her mid-thirties and I passed the book along to my fifteen year old neighbor. It's a great light read, that most will appreciate.The next two books are great as well. Sloppy Firsts was my first foray back into teen fiction since I read \"the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" I few years ago. There's several things that I quickly noticed about this book. First off, if I had a young daughter, there is not much chance that I would let her read this book at any age younger than 17 (even though I was reading books much worse than this when I was probably 12 and hiding them between the mattresses so my mom wouldn't find out). This book focuses on the story of Jessica Darling, a highschool sophomore, whose best friend had just moved away. Faced with dealing with the lose, Jessica gets caught up in the ups and downs of highschool life, including becoming friends with the school bad boy, ousting the in-crowd, and becoming more and more distance from her family.Much of the book focuses on two things: Jessica's infatuation with Marcus the school druggie and Jessica's virginity. There's a lot of references to drugs and sex throughout the book (very typical of the high school experience today). While the book deals with the issues in a mature and sensible way, I can understand why my local Borders had this book listed among the adult fiction. All in all, this was a good coming of age novel, one that I would recommend to others. I'm 32 and this seems a little young, I couldn't get into it. I guess I should have paid more attention to the target audience age."

         "I bought this book thinking it was actually 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch', which we originally checked-out from the local library. Unfortunately, this book only features part of Owney's fascinating and almost unbelievable travels...and the pictures are only sketches of the original photographs that are in the other book. Over all, I was really disapointed in this re-telling about Owney. The details are just not there, especially after reading the other book. This edition might be good for little ones, like maybe three and up, who can't sit still through a more detailed version, but 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch' offers the listener a richer version of the story with REAL photographs of who is assumed to be Owney. This book, in my opinion, just doesn't cut-it. Consider the other book instead. This is a fun book for kids, and since it's a true story it adds a little history as well. Very nice illustrations. I do wish, tho, that children's books were listed with a suggested age range. This book seems right for a 5 to 9 year old, and I was shopping for a book for an older child. I've played this guessing game with Amazon for other children's book purchases, so I hope somebody hears this! The Ownie book, tho, was so darned cute I'm keeping it for a different child who will be old enough for it soon. Hmmm...I wonder if Amazon gets me to buy more books this way..."

         "This Place Of Men",
         "This place of Men is an awesome story. Doug Cooper-Spencer proves that he is as great a writer as his contemporaries E. Lynn Harris and James Earl Hardy. The characters in this book are most captivating and the story pulses to an unexpected climax. My only disappointment is that I have to wait for another Cooper-Spencer book. I give this book 5 of 5 stars. Embarking on a journey to reestablish a life that was almost ruined is never easy, especially in a town where it all happened. In \"This Place of Men\", Author Doug Cooper-Spencer takes you on this journey through the eyes of Otis, who returns to his hometown of Cincinnati, a place he had never returned to ever since being falsely accused of the statutory rape of his teenage sweetheart Terrell. Even though it is twenty years later, both men realize they still have inner demons that they must face before facing each other. For Otis, it was confronting his father who turned his back on him when he needed him the most. For Terrell, even though married with children, it's dealing with the reality of his true sexuality. A reality that he not only didn't have the courage to face up to as a teenager, but also brought on the downfall of his lover, Otis.Doug Cooper-Spencer carefully brings you into the complex life of both men, showing how ones past shortcomings can affect the others future. Terrell, a husband, father and successful accountant for his church, while Otis who was clearly struggling through hard times living homeless in the streets of New York City. Though now back in the same town, these past lovers are clearly living in two totally different worlds. However, Doug Cooper-Spencer slowly brings their worlds together by revealing a commonality both men have other than their sexuality.A lot of us could really indentify with Terrell, due to his strong religious upbringing. There are a lot of young gay black teens, to this day, who are struggling with the pressures of growing up in households just like Terrell's. Many may have a hard time coming out or may not come out at all. Most may even end up like the characters such as Stanton and Jerry; married men who can only partake in exclusive parties that cater to men like them who feel the need to give in to their homosexual inhibitions.GBM Book Club believes that this is a book that every gay black man needs to read. Doug Cooper-Spencer opens your eyes to the fact that as gay black men, we need to be conscious of the decisions we make in our lives. We cannot close our eyes to every little thing and take it for granted. Otis is an unfortunate example due to Terrell's parents waiting for him to turn eighteen in order to accuse him of statutory rape. If Otis had the right mind-set to take careful precautions, or if Terrell had the courage to speak up, Otis doing time could have definitely been prevented. Even in reality there are so many of us that are either doing time or suffering the consequences of a mistake we made along the way. And until we make right and conscious decisions and have the courage to speak up for one another, we will never find our place. But if you want to embark on a journey that will lead you down the right path, then by all means we encourage you to read and discover \"This Place of Men\". Twenty years ago, two teenage boys, Otis and Terrell, fell in love, physically acted on that love, and suffered very different consequences for their demonstrative affection. Otis is incarcerated for his part while Terrell is sentenced to the even crueler punishment of a churchified exorcism of his wicked ways and a false marriage to an always-suspicious wife, an outward ideal, replete with two beautiful children, that belies the rot within the lie he and they live.Set in a close-knit Cincinnati community, where everyone knows everybody's business, whether they admit it or not, Otis, having served his sentence, followed by nearly two decades domiciled in the anonymity of New York City, makes a prodigal return home.Both men, older, not that much wiser, and still with deep, but oppressed feelings for each other, hopelessly resist that inevitable meeting, sparked on by beautifully rendered remembrances sprinkled throughout this mournful tale of innocent love damaged by societal condemnations and recriminations as sad, hypocritical, and emotionally crippling as anything out of Seventeenth Century Salem without the literal stake burnings.Doug Cooper-Spencer's \"This Place of Men\" is a bittersweet tale of love dashed against the rocks of a recalcitrant river of intolerance. It is a mildly enjoyable read that teases with all the elements of grand opera--reflective arias, sweeping dramatic movements, narrative orchestrated with cascading arpeggios, gentle pianissimos, and thunderous fortes, strings and brass, woodwinds and kettle drums--but, alas, the author's use of all the instruments he's brought to the concert hall are tentative, therefore less effective as they could be.The story promises great passion upon which it does not always deliver, which tends to disappoint considering the rich possibilities engendered by the very idea of two innocents in love being robbed of their happiness, and living for so many years with all the unfair consequences visited upon them by hypocrisy, bigotry, and the greatest cut of all, polite indifference.When it comes to the narrative, author Cooper-Spencer is just fine, at times poignant, but he is constantly hamstringed by a lack of emotional boldness and dialogue that has not been pruned of its ordinariness, that remains unadorned, oftentimes not compelling the reader to discover character through the clues shrewdly and compellingly left by things said.\"This Place of Men\" takes a long time getting around to its reveal and ultimate d&eacute;nouement, and when they are finally shown--why Otis was incarcerated, what happens when these two men meet after all these years--we wonder if the set-ups were worth the wait.Nonetheless, there is much to admire about this brooding meditation that at least harkens toward self-love in spite of society's oppressive attitudes. That is its boldness.Also, we are left with a sense of hope by the last page, which could easily spawn a sequel. I encourage Mr. Cooper-Spencer to make sure part two contains sharper dialogue, stronger conflicts, and a busier red pencil."

         "I have read every book I could find on home organization and \"clutter-busting\". This book is the first one that contained practical, truly helpful information. We are preparing for our second child and just finished a remodel so I really needed some workable tactics to get our home in order. I carried this book around the house with me, consulting it as I went from room to room trying to figure out what to do with an overwhelming accumulation of \"stuff\". It has taken a couple of months, but the recommendations I implemented from this book are now paying off. I know where everything is, I have made a lot fewer \"necessary\" purchases and the house is a lot easier to clean up on short notice!This book also has the gentle guidance you need when trying to cope with your emotional attachments to your possessions. This book isn't full of intimidating, glossy photos of perfectly organized rooms. Instead, it is full of information you will use on a daily basis to both clean up your space and keep it that way. This book does the job and does it well. The authors' experience is evident throughout. Written clearly and efficiently, the book has many practical suggestions about all aspects of downsizing. In addition, it is written with humor and a real understanding of the practical and emotional stresses that downsizing, a major life event, present to those involved and their families. The book is now over 5 years old, but everything in it is still current. Strongly recommended."

         "Who Wrote the Bible?",
         "This book is a must-read for all bible scholars including: jews, christians (denominational or not), or anyone else interested in the hebrew bible.The hebrew bible finally makes sense after reading this book! I no longer see paradoxes, mysteries, and confusions in the bible, but understand why certian contradictory statements exist in the bible. This is because this book examines not only who wrote the hebrew bible, but in what religio-socio-political climate it was written. At the end of the book, the reader understands much more than &quot;who wrote the bible,&quot; but actually understands HOW and WHY the bible was written. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the bible. This is an excellent book. In it, the author tells the story of how he and others before him unraveled the mystery of who wrote the books of the Old Testament. It is a compelling tale, and a fascinating one for anyone interested in this subject.In a nutshell, (spoilers ahead) it has been revealed that the Old Testament consists of four compilations written by four different authors at different times with diverse, and often contradictory, agendas. After the first compilation, the others merely built upon it and revised it to suit their agendas. For instance, a later author might come along and, unsatisfied with how the earlier author presented his people, his faction, or his ancestors, rewrite and rework the earlier work to present his group more favorably. Often, the incentive was economic, i.e., if the author was a priest of a particular group, he would write the compilation so as to denigrate other competing groups of priests and require the people to come to his group for sacrifices and other services for which the group received income. Ultimately, and ironically, someone combined these competing compilations together into what we now know as the Old Testament, leaving many unresolved conflicts and outright contradictions.After reading this, I don't see how anyone could maintain that the Old Testament is \"literally true,\" for how is it that God would commission four contradictory retellings of the history of his people and then have them combined in such a way that leaves the vast majority of the contradictions and inconsistencies? In many places, one story cannot be true if another is true. They cannot all be true.Furthermore, it seems impossible that the Old Testament could be divinely inspired at all, for the same reason. Even if only the first compilation (J) was divinely inspired, it would seem that God would be able to prevent the subsequent bastardization of his word by combining it with the subsequent accounts into what has become the basis of Judaism and Christianity. The fact that Jesus accepted the truth of the Bible as written and the prophecies contained therein casts enormous doubt on any claim that Jesus could indeed be the Son of God (if he even existed).The author does not carry his work to these logical conclusions, for obvious reasons, but they are the only conclusions one can draw when one has completed this book.Overall, I highly recommend \"Who Wrote the Bible.\" At a minimum, this is \"must read\" material to anyone that considers the Bible to be the source of his or her religious faith. Even those that don't should learn about the history of this amazing book, which is perhaps the most influencial of all time. I write this to an audience that believes Monotheism was an advance in the theological system of the ancient Near East. I personally believe in Reincarnation, but have trouble melding this belief with multi-deity religions. With this personal introduction, I offer that this book is an outstanding literary work. It is easily readable. Unlike many texts on religious literature, it is clear, precise, and most importantly, very enjoyable reading. It addresses questions any reader of the Bible has regarding duplication of it's stories and obvious contradictions. More importantly, this book illuminates the faces and lives of the several individual people who actualy composed portions of the Bible, giving them personalities, and showing their perspectives, personal agendas, and prejudices. The thesis is developed well and the conclusions are enjoyable, if not ironic. The Appendix divides the Bible into proposed authorship, allowing for comparison to other authorship theories. Most importantly, this book gives a glimpse into the literary and spiritual process that led to Monotheism. A great work. I found this concise, well written book surprisingly interesting and engaging. The author reveals that the Old Testament is comprised of works by several writers created at different points in time that have been woven together to create the current version of the Bible. The biblical authors are framed in their historical context to aid the reader in understanding their particular perspective. This is a scholarly work written to speak to all interested readers. I found Friedman's hypothosis to be far more compelling, rational, and just plain interesting than the teaching on the origin of scripture that I grew up with. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in taking their knowledge of scripture beyond the Sunday School stage. This is an excellent book for those who want to deepen their knowledge about the Old Testament. It was written in a simple language that can be understand by those who are not scholars. Richard Friedman synthesizes hundreds of years of critical biblical scholarship and presents it in the crisp style of a can't-put-it-down detective story. He presents fascinating--but technical--information in a compulsively readable, non-technical format. This book is the definitive starting point for any lay person interested in how the first five books of the Bible were put together.The real history of these books may be more complex than what is presented here, but Dr. Friedman presents a strong case in support of general authorship by the usual suspects of critical biblical scholarship--slippery individuals known primarily by their aliases: J, E, D, P, and R.My only complaint is with the name, &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?&quot; This name suggests that authorship of the entire Bible will be assessed. Instead, however, the inquiry focuses exclusively on the first five books of the Old Testament (known as the Torah or Pentatuch). The book does not address the authorship of the other books of the Old Testament or of any of the books of the New Testament. Even so, it's a great read. First, note that Friedman's \"Bible\" is the Christian \"Old Testament.\" For equally good books about the New Testament, look up the works of Hyam Maccoby and Burton L. Mack.Second, \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" took me back to my undergraduate classes in the Old Testament, refreshing my memory regarding such issues as the Documentary Hypothesis, but going beyond with the latest scholarship (a lot has happened in the last twenty plus years!) I can't say enough good things about this book. Friedman's &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?&quot; is a good book that explores the documentary hypothesis quite well. It is easy to read and interesting. However, a more compelling and convincing argument about the authorship of the first book of the Bible can be found in &quot;The Genius of Genesis&quot; by Dennis Shulman. Read both of these books if you want a more balanced perspective on the questions Richard Friedman and the modern biblical scholars raise. This is the best introduction to the JEPD hypothesis available. So if that's what you're after, this is your book. If you're going to study it thoroughly and carefully, I recommend keeping a good Bible handy, especially the Oxford Bible, which is the best for scholarly (non-denominational, non-devotional, non-theological) study.If you are reading the Bible simply for scholarly or literary purposes, a book like this is great.I recommend following this one up with a book like \"The Bible Unearthed\" by Finkelstein and Silberman, which deals with archaeology rather than textual investigation; and I strongly recommend reading a couple books by Hershel Shanks. After just this short reading list, you'll be able to digest even the most scholarly work on the Hebrew Bible, by folks like Mark Smith.But if you are looking for help reading the Bible as an element of your religious devotion, this book is probably not what you're looking for. Basically, modern scholars try to discover what the texts meant when they were written, rather than what they might mean to us. That takes a lot of irreverent detective work, and believers are usually uncomfortable, often defensive, when they encounter critical scholarship.HOWEVER - this is a big one - I honestly believe that the Biblical texts get much richer when critical scholarship is coupled with traditional and modern interpretations. The first chapters of Genesis provide a great example. Modern scholarship offers a lot of insight into what those stories (might have) meant to their original writers and audiences, and what they meant to later editors as well. We discover the spirituality of the ancients that has been hidden beneath more recent interpretations.Now you don't have to throw out your tradition's more recent interpretations. Although you might choose to do that, most traditions have a lot of other theological options.So, this is a long way of saying that if you read the Bible devotionally, then sure, modern scholarship will probably be challenging to your faith. But I encourage you not to put your head in the sand: find out what the scholars are saying. If, ultimately, you simply have to disagree and take a defensive stance, at least you'll know what you're up against. But probably, despite some struggles, you'll come to a much greater appreciation for the human authors of your scriptures, and for the depths of meaning hidden in the scriptures themselves. Not only that, but when you learn to see the scriptures from different perspectives, you'll probably learn a lot about your own tradition. This book is a must read for anyone who has either read or plans to read the Bible or the Torah. This book gives you a good base too start from."

         "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet A. Jacobs: A True Tale of Slavery, by John S. Jacobs",
         "I enjoyed this book. It was a real story from how it was long ago for this woman. It is a long book, but it is worth it! Awesome read, could not put it down. Highly recommend for anyone, any age. The author takes you with her into her experience as a slave and finally to freedom. Better than Uncle Tom's Cabin which I found to be a bit of propaganda. This was engrossing and hopeful. Glad I read it. This book is excellent for those who want to know what life was like as a slave. It was very moving to read about her experiences growing up, and the lengths she had to go to to protect herself and her familiy. Highly recommended. I really liked this book but I don't like finger pointing slavery was a very disgusting thing and should not have ever happened but all do not white women did not have a easy life either. I usually read just Christian romance books, but this was recommended to me by a friend, and I have hardly been able to put it down. I have not finished it yet because I don't have a lot of free time to read, but when I do, I pick it up and start reading. It has held my interest from the very beginning. Any one whose primary view of slavery is from Gone With The Wind should read this book. The author does a great job of illustrating the physical and emotional devastation of being considered by law to be owned by another person. The thing that struck me so personally was how this woman knew in her deepest part that the way she was forced to live was not right and that she would push the limits of all possibility to achieve what she knew in her heart was possible. If, like me (a white, middleclass male), you ever deeply felt there is more to life than what is routinely offered, you will identify at this level. Being freed was not enough. She spent the second half of her life working to free and educate other slaves. That is true enlightenment.Her writing is sparse, eloquent and heartfelt. I could blather on and on about how wonderful this book is. If you are unsure about how much racism has wounded the spirit of African-Americans, this book will lay some foundation for that understanding. I have read many books about Slavery in our country. None have effected me like this one. The writer made you live threw her life as she experienced it. I cried and laughed along with her. I predict this book will be the talk at the dinner table when more people discover what it holds between the cover. What I particularly like about this book is how easy it is to read through. The southern vernacular dialect is sparse and not used by Harriet/Linda in the book. Further, the retelling of the horrors of slavery are not overdramatized -- it's not necessary to get the reader's attention. The everyday nature of these attocities are evident in the straightforward reporting of the events.The dynamics of the household are fascinating when you read of the jealous mistresses who are infuriated at their husbands' infidelities under their roofs and how they mistreat the slave women who are subjected to their husband's unwelcomed advances.Harriet's Grandmother is a remarkable woman of her day -- she became free and through hard work bought many of her own family members. She was a highly respected member of the community lending money to whites and blacks alike.Survival and freedom for herself and her children is Harriet's objective and her unyielding determination is inspiring.This story tells how difficult it was to be a woman in the south and particularly an attractive woman in slavery I absolutely love this book. It saddens me immensely to see how human beings can mistreat, abuse and hurt another human being that way no matter what color their skin is. This book tells Linda story and you can feel her pain and misery in each page while her believe in God and the love for and of her family kept her going until she got her freedom. very interesting and means more when written about lifes trials. I ike her style of writting. I would recommend this book. very interesting and horrifying that we have allowed people to be treated like this! Hope that our genteration can be more helpful to those less fortunate. I found this book to be very interesting and factual, for a person who like non fiction books this one is right up your alley. Written in a true voice, this narrative compares favorably with other slave accounts such as &#34;Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember: An Oral History&#34; edited by James Mellon and available from Amazon but not yet on Kindle. This book is well-written and gripping, and helps us to remember today just how damaging prejudice and intolerance can be. Judy Home I truly did like this book and all the things you can learn from it. However, the editor of this version made several mistakes in putting words together. This made it harder to read than necessary. I recommend this book, but read one produced by a different publisher. I write this review to applaud the courage of this woman. Not only did she live through and experience episodes in her life that no person should ever have experienced; she had the strength to chronicle the episodes of her life. Would this have been an easy task for her to do? She mentions how difficult it was; it is my hope that God has provided her a heavenly place for eternity. She has told her story in a most respectful and very kind fashion considering the fact that animals were treated better than these Black American's were. Certainly another example of man and his capacity at cruelty; at the expense of another human being or race of people. A disgraceful period in the history of this country; one we need to learn from so these atrocities are never permitted to take place again. The book I received has a different cover than the one pictured, but it is the same edition and everything as far as I can tell. A story of a young black girl born into slavery gives the reader an honest insight of a shameful time in America's past. It shows the strength of the human spirit to escape persecution and reclaim life. A wonderful read. I loved this book. It was a little difficult to read at times due to the language at that time. But overall I wanted to know more of the authors story with each page. incredible story, I felt honored to have been able to read what this woman wrote. I read that the play that was due to run on the day following the assassination if President Lincoln was named The Mullatoe. I have never been one to care for opinion or judgment based on comparative suffering. Within any category, some individuals and sub groupings will suffer more or less than others. I think that people of good will understand group dynamics but attempt to understand and accept the individual viewpoint. The woman who wrote this book was a slave. She was subject to abuse including sexual abuse. She ran away from the slaver who imprisoned her in slavery and she hid herself away for years in a cramped attic space until she was able to flee to Philadelphia. Eventually her two children, also escapees from slavery, joined her. In the North there remained the fear of recapture and especially with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. Harriet Ann Jacobs is the first ex slave known to have written her autobiography.The Library of Congress contains records of What we regard as &#34;white&#34; people who were enslaved. There is a book called, &#34;They were White and They were Slaves&#34; by Michael Hoffman. As I read this book I got the impression that Michael Hoffman was angry that the enslavement of White people was denied, ignored, or minimized because it may have been of shorter duration than slavery involving Black people. It seems Michael Hoffman's work drew so little attention that he had to resort to David Duke and people of similarly extreme views to get a reading for his work. Hoffman did not seem to share David Duke's antipathy toward Jewish people though David Duke would probably argue that he is anti Zionist or anti Israel instead of anti Semitic. I do not credit the distinctions. But I understand Michael Hoffman's ire over the fact that the academic world and the general media minimize or ignore the facts of enslavement of White people. Again, comparative suffering is not a proper framework for understanding though it us a good excuse for fighting.Scientific racism continues to shape the acceptance and discussion of race. It was never a matter of science but always a master if profit, property, and power when it came to race. Northerner a traveling in slave states were often appalled to see White women and children up for sale on the slave block. When the Northerners expressed amazement or if they objected, Southerners would explain that they were slaves who looked White but who had known African ancestry and so were &#34;lawfully&#34; or even mandatorily enslaved. No small amount of Northern anti slavery sentiment was based in the stories of enslavement of people who were indistinguishable from White people. Slaves with light-coloured skin complexion made for more sympathetic skin complexion when it came to building support for anti abolitionism. People who had no traceable African ancestry could be enslaved and this prospect terrified many. Records were often unavailable and ancestry for purposes of slavery could be established by testimony of as few two witnesses. Sexual exploitation was often a motive in slavery.A few academic types theorised that that the author could not have bern a Black woman. This is the same type that denied the reality if Sally Hemmings, an enslaved woman and her relationship with President Thomas Jefferson. Black history has traditionally been lost, stolen, or destroyed. Thus us a great read for this month and a still noteworthy accomplishment and true triumph over adversity for Harriet Ann Jacobs. This book leaves a black mark (no punn intended) on history in the United States. This should be a text book in US high schools. Let people understand where blacks and whites came from originally, as well as the relationship between the north and the south. A great book, with the depth and breadth of REAL history. Published in 1861, unbelievable at the time by many. This novel is a very important look on American history. I found this book to be very interesting. It explained the abuse and hardships that the slaves had to indure. It was written in such a way that you actually felt that you were going through the difficulties with them. It is so hard to believe that people could treat others in this manner. Thank God that we no longer have slaves here in America. I have three friends waiting in line to read this book. I was delighted to find this title here. I first read it as an undergrad and then later as a graduate student interested in slave narratives. Jacobs gives a highly sensitive insight into the inner psyche of the female slave. This work is not only of great importance as a member of the \"slave narrative\" genre, but also of women's literature in general. It is wonderful to hear the highly femanized yet powerfully strong female voice of our narrator. Would be fantastic as a summer reading project for precocious teens along with Uncle Tom's cabin and Frederick Douglass. Plus, it's just a darned, good read! My wife and I (both senior citizens)found the book both interesting and informative. The main characters were pretty well fleshed out and the action kept moving along pretty well. I would recommend it. It gave a glimpse of a life so different from today. There are very real life books about what it was like to be a woman and a slave in the Old South, but this book is a lot more than just a dusty old historical tome. The books offers an unapologetic look at that horrible Southern institution, and details the atrocities, both large and small, committed against these innocents.It can be a tough read at times because of the cruelty of that era, but the slave characters themselves have such an innate human dignity and decency it provides enough light to get you through the really rough patches.An important work and highly recommended. i had never read this piece despite a degree in English. I think it should be required reading for anyone studying American history. While we will never know the full truth behind this work, the lessons and insights are powerful. I'm glad that I stumbled across this and look forward to sharing it with my children. Touching story that follows her through a hard time in history. A must read for history buffs of this time period. I found \"Letters from a Slave Girl: The Story of Harriet Jacobs\" by Mary E. Lyons at a used book sale. I was fascinated by the story. It was in seeking a more detailed and historical account that I looked for a copy of \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" by Harriet Jacobs herself. I was surprised and delighted to find that I could purchase a copy of the text for my Kindle for $1.50. The Kindle version is produced by scanning in a copy of the manuscript. As a result there are quite a few typos. Mostly these consist in the concatenation of adjacent words. Despite these flaws, I found that I quickly adapted, to the point that I hardly noticed them at all.The publication of this book in 1861 has an interesting history itself. Harriet Jacobs was so concerned for the consequences of her publication for those still living amongst her former slave masters that all of the names, including her own, and the locations are changed. In this regard, it is interesting to compare Lyons book with Jacobs, since Lyons' book uses the actual names and locations. The story is an autobiography of Harriet Jacobs life as a slave in North Carolina, and something of her subsequent life as a \"free\" woman living in the North during the days of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Jacob's account of her life under slavery is detailed and somewhat unique, in that it is given from the perspective of a young woman living, not on a plantation, but in town. Her account comes across as something of a page-turner, the reader eager for Jacob's safety and ultimate escape. Because of the suspense depicted in her account, I do not wish to detract from the reading experience by revealing much of the details. For these reasons, I am surprised that no one has, to my knowledge, ever tried to make a movie of her account. The account is brutally honest. No one comes off unscathed, not the white man who helped her children, and especially not Jacob's herself. Perhaps only her grandmother and one white woman who defended her grandmother appear unsullied. Still, we cannot come away from this book without incredible respect for Jacob's character and persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. If you want a close up look of slavery in the days leading up to the Civil War, even in the best of circumstances, I cannot more highly recommend this book. Good Book! The only thing that I don't understand is why did they change all the names in this book. The book is very interesting, enough so, that I went to the computer and looked it up and continued the search for the slave girl that I felt so attached to after reading this book, \"It is in the book. The book it is very good and I could read it time and again. If u never felt anything for the Slaves before, you will after reading this book. It brings out only pity for the way that they were treated. Good overall description of the books, and was delivered in a short amount of time. I recommend this book to anyone that has felt an outcast. What slaves went through, i could not imagine. How could any human being have the right to own another, is inhumane and ungodly. Cruelty still lingers today with prejudices against anyone who isn't white and something that will always sadly remain. I would have been a refuge to a slave with helping in the underground railroad. Slavery should have never existed. To me, Americans were so lazy in taking care of themselves in that time of slavery. May they burn in hell forever for the cruelty they instilled onto human beings. Jacobs was a slave-- and endured unbearable harships to escape the unwanted \"romantic\" attentions of her owner and eventually slavery altogether. Her text, written as an autobiography to prove, in part, that an African American woman could be just as moral and brave as the target audience of white women who were ignoring the slave system as something they had nothing to do with, is a classic of African American literature. The story is interesting, well-written and sometimes as tense as any dramatic nail-biter. This is a historical document as much as it is a good read. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to know about the US troubled relationship with race, still today and in our past. I am in the process of reading the book, it is well written. The words can actually put you in the setting. This book did not hold my interest. It was a book I could easily put down and walk away from. I enjoyed this book. It kept you wanting to read more. It was so real like and informative. Great book I rate this book in the top 5 of all the inspirational books I have read. It is a very moving story of the horrors of slavery, by a very courageous and resourceful young woman. It is a real heart tugger, and I could not put this book down until I finished it. I hope to meet this girl when I cross over after this life. What an example of spunk! Not everyone could have done what she did. She had grit and courage. I would like to punch that so called doctor in the nose. I have never understood slavery-how Christian people could be involved. I would reccomend this read to anyone who likes history and to see someone triumph against all odds. Very informative! It pays never to give up on your dreams! I loved it!!!!! Would recommend to my friends!!!!! Lovely Harriet Jacobs, as an ex-enslaved female African American, wrote not only one of the first but also one of the most powerful narratives of enslavement. For any reader, of any race, desirous of experiencing something of the horrors of slavery, \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" delivers.Jacobs documents the horrendous treatment she and her fellow enslaved family members endured. Treated as nothing more than chattel, Jacobs repeatedly resisted the lewd advances of her owner. True escape and freedom impossible, Harriet \"escaped\" to a tiny underground hole in a relative's shack. Imagine what it was like for her to \"live\" there for seven years, watching through crevices her children age and her relatives raped.External freedom impossible, her story explores the possibility of internal freedom. In her case, found through her Christian faith and her hope of earthly freedom some day and heavenly freedom one day.\"Incidents\" is mind-expanding, awe-inspiring, and soul-developing. Read it to learn and to change.Reviewer: Robert W. Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\" He has also authored \"Soul Physicians\" and \"Spiritual Friends.\" Here is a surprising find. I had not heard for it before. It is an excellent read and full of insight into the life of slaves and free blacks in the south, north and in Europe in the late middle 19th century.It was not at all what I had expected after the disappointment of Uncle Tom's Cabin a while back. This is an autobiography well worth reading. If you are a history fan, or study women's issues or race relations, you will not be disappointed. I really enjoyed the book. It's well written and easy reading. It is a window into a time and place I could never imagine. The trials that the main character goes through for the good of her loved ones is incredible. She never gave up her struggles, always seeking a better life, but she never gave up her humanity. This book is wonderful. It was so hard to put down at times. Highly recommended. A must read for people of all ages I am building a collection of African American History books and have found many free books available on line. I appreciate having this one for my tablet.This book is gripping, powerful and beautifully written. It gives you a first hand account of the brutality and inhumanity of slavery. The resolve and will of this women could not be broken. I had to read it in small doses as it brought tears to my eyes many times. Linda was an extraordinary woman who loved God and her family and whose faith brought her through many hardships. I cheered her every success. This book is certainly worth the time and is highly recommended. It should be a must read in Language Arts classes. This story reveals the joy and pain of a woman who lived her life in slavery. The suspense holds you until the end. Highly recommended - t I plowed through this book in only a few days. It was well written and interesting. Definitely worth the read when its free!! This book is hard to put down, and hard to pick up. Dramatic recall of her life as a slave and her escape. I love this book and recommend it to anyone wanting to know the truth about life as a female slave. Wow!!!! I read this brilliant slave narrative about 15 yrs ago in college but it never left my heart. One of the few books I refused to resell to the college bookstore! A definite must read!... 12/24/12 its 20 yers now, I think I will reread this over the holidays... Often taught along side Frederick Douglass's Narritive of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl offers an important incite into the abuses that female slaves faced. While Douglass's narrative stresses house slavery emasculated male slaves, Jacbos shows how slavery robbed female slaves of their womanhood. Jacobs' alter-ego, Linda Brent, was never physically beaten, like Douglass; the horrors of slavery for her were sexual horrors. Linda must try to ward of the sexual advances of her master while simultaneously dealing with the sexual jealously of her mistress.This text is important because it shows how the experience of slavery was gendered and how the experience of womanhood was different for people in different classes. Linda's mother, grandmother, and first mistress all believed in the cult of true womanhood, a prevelant ideology in mid-nineteenth century America that said that women should be \"pure, pious, domestic and submissive.\" Linda was raised with these ideas, but failed to live up to them. While Linda feels shameful and guilty for failing to live up to the standards of the cult of true womanhood, she realizes that slave women cannot be judged by the same standards as middle-class white women because their cultural context is so different. This is, perhaps, the most radical and important message in Jacobs' text.From the time that the narrative was published (anonymously) until the 1980s, the authenticity of Jacobs' narrative has been called into question. For over 100 years, scholars and historians assumed that the narrative was false, either ghost written by the editor (Lydia Maria Child) or completely written by her without a grain of truth. Thanks to the work of historian Jean Fagan Yellin, we now know that the narrative was written by Jacobs herself and that all the major events in the narrative are true. There is no reason why this book shouldn't be read as an authentic slave narrative. I rarely write review to books I read. Notwithstanding, this particular book bet the differ. As I ready this book over the course of a week, my heart weeps. Sorrow the human soul can handle yet come out smiling. Harriet wrote this book to inform us tribulations and triumph of human soul. To learn from yet looking around dread and suffering yet lingers. WEEP! Anyone interested in the history of slavery, indeed general American history, should not fail to read this book. Very, very interesting, easy to read, a page-turner. I thoroughly recommend this book. It is alternately heartbreaking, heartwarming, scary, but above all- REAL. It is Very well written. Let us NEVER forget the past, lest we repeat it. This woman's story had me on a roller coaster, and that's a century later and simply reading her story. I can only imagine what she, and so many others, went through during these times. Yet this book is penned with skill, dignity, humility, faith, and stark honesty and reality. Don't miss this- it is very worth your time. Very eye opening and touching. My heart goes out to this writer. What a brave woman. Thanks to her for sharing! Incidents is typically viewed as an outstanding example of Black feminist resistance to slavery as well as a protest against the fugitive slave laws. Yet, it can also be seen as an assessment of the forces available to eliminate slavery as a whole, part of a debate that unfolded in the years leading up to the civil war about what force could possibly overthrow slavery whose ascendancy not only over the South, but over the entire nation seemed unstoppable when this book was written.Its history is a testament to the growth of racism among American literary \"experts\" and historians. While Harriet Jacobs was celebrated in her time as the author of this book and used this celebrity to advance her struggle to advance the lives of refugee slaves during the Civil War and of freed slaves after the Civil War, the racism that followed the imposition of Jim Crow Segregation and the US grab for colonies in Asia and Latin America in the late 19th and 20th Centuries led to the memory of her work being extinguished. By the 1950s and 1960s the scholarly world had come to believe this book was a fiction written by Lydia Maria Child. No one familiar with Child could think that she would do such a thing.We owe Jean Fagan Yellin and her collaborators the honor of resurrecting Harriet Jacob's authorship and career. In a startling masterpiece of research ,Yellin's team documented the truth of everything narrated in this book. We are also enriched by Yellin's recent biography entitled Harriet Jacobs.Besides the usual, Incidents represents a catalog of different ways to escape or lessen the impact of slavery. We have the noble faithful servent in the person of Linda Brent's mother who buys herself with the aid of white who honors her position, we have attempts to escape through the sexual favors of a white man, we have people buying their way out of slavery, we have violent and non violent escapes. We also see Linda Brent's resistence and the success of her clandestine life and later her escapes to Philiadephia, then New York, then England, as a result not only of her individual bravery, character, and devotion to her people and her family and her honor, but of the existence of resources beyond the slave and Black community that can free not only the individual slave but put an end to slavery. We also have the racism that made Jacobs feel not totally free in the North.This is the crucial place Incidents belongs. The publications (Uncle Tom was first published as a serial in an antislavery newspaper and later published as a book) of Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 and 1852 unleashed at the dialog opened among contemporary African American texts about how to eliminate slavery in response to Stowe's great work. Harriet Beecher Stowe had recommended the Christic experience of evangelical Christianity in Uncle Tom, Martin Delany recommended the reculturation of Blacks by a bourgeois independent state's aristocratic and cultural leadership, William Wells Brown pointed to the ship of capitalism coming the vanquish the slave ships.Jacob's text enters this debate with an array of forces within the African American slave and free community, as well as within the Southern white community, as well as the Northern and even international community that can be used to defeat slavery. We have the slaves themselves debating, organizing, and resisting. We have freed Blacks North and South helping. We have whites in the South itself helping, if inadequately. We have supporters of women's rights and opponents of slavery among the women of the North. We have the international opponents of slavery in Britain and beyond.Jacobs highlights not only her own incredibly courageous resistance to slavery, but to the array of forces available to fight slavery. In the weeks and months after this book was published in 1861, those same forces did in fact overthrow slavery and crush it forever more.This is a stirring book written by an articulate and educated writer. Indeed contrary to what is said elsewhere, even narratives written or told by semiliterate African Americans who escaped slavery never contained dialect, but were written in clear standard English. Indeed, scholars have noted that where Jacobs tries to reproduce Black English spoken by unacculturated slaves, she had to fall back on the conventions of theatrical stereotypical imitations of Black English, rather than reproduce real Black English. She had been reared in a standard English environment, had escaped and lived and functioned among an even more stardard English environment, and by the time she wrote this book, almost 20 years after she had escaped from slavery, she was actually unfamiliar with real Black English!Not only was Jacobs literate, but she was apparently very familiar with contemporary Womens or sentimental novels exemplified by Uncle Tom and Susan Warner's Wide Wide World.Jacobs had spent much time in her bondage in Edenton, reading. Later, in Rochester New York, Jacobs ran a anti-slavery reading room associated with Frederick Douglass's North Star. For nearly a decade in New York, Jacobs worked as a house keeper and nanny for one of the most popular journalists in the country. She also knew and received support from her boss's estranbed sister, the widely popular journalist and fiction writer Sara Payson Willis Parton, known by her pen name Fannie Fern. In Ruth Hall, Parton's famous novel a roman A clef biography, Fanny Fern, there isa chacter obviously modeled after Harriet Jacobs. Jacob's maintained an extensive correspondence with some of leading activists in the womens and antislavery movements of her time in both the United States and Great Britain.Incidents follows the styles and conventions of the sentimental novels so well that for decades many believed that it was actually a novel written by a white female sentimental author, not by a escaped slave. The Sentimental novels whose central work is to create sympathy usually signfied by the reader's tears, by the suffering, the righteousness, and ultimately the lack of physical power in a wicked world for its heroines and heroes. To that extent, they reflected the lack of social power and opportunity for liberation of 19th Century women.Jacobs has a totally different approach, remarkable given these conventions. Susan Warner, author of the first big blockbuster novel, Wide Wide World, could make a day in the life of a 10 year old girl seem like a life of torture. Yet, Jacobs forgo the obvious, easy opportunity to dwell on Harriet Jacobs's undeniably extreme suffering hiding in an attick. Instead the book focuses on her spirit of resistance, the availability of allies, and the real possibilities for her deliverence through her own power. Rather than the isolated slave mother locked in an attic, Jacob's Linda Brent is a person who is helped in her struggle by white and black, free and slave in Edenton, helped by sailors and antislavery activists up and done the US coast and in Canada, and helped by people as far away as England. Rather than a victim who deserves our tears, Jacobs shows how there are forces to help her fight for freedom, and she wins.If in the weeks and months in 1860 and early 1861 when this book was written the slave power seemed unstoppable. Yet, the power, the ability to act, the ability to defeat slavery shown in Jacob's book, discloses the forces and the will that would abolish slavery forever in a few brief years. Fascinating to read this story from a slaves point of view. You get a very different look at what daily life was like then. I thought this would be truly interesting, but found that it was very boring and poorly written. I was sorely disappointed. This book has every emotion locked inside of it. While reading the book I could vividly imagine what was happening and feel like I was there. There are so many better written reviews that I cannot better but I could not stop from adding how important this memoir is for all Americans to read and get a small glimpse of the suffering and degradation that slavery brought to our country. We owe so much to our African-American citizens to begin to make it right for their loss of freedom, the loss of family members, the loss of everything that we non-blacks take for granted.It is hard to imagine what everyday life was like for a slave but the author Jacobs tells it in such un-elaborated language that it chills my heart. It took me a long time to finish because it is so intense.Harriet Jacobs lived in an Anne Frank-like cellar that was much smaller, much more inhumane, just to keep her freedom and life. Others died rather than submit to the degradation of being subject to named and unnamed torture. I am ashamed in 2011 that this happened. My ancestors arrived in the US after slavery was repealed but perhaps they would have participated also, there is no way to know. It was a way of life in the south.What would we do if faced with a situation like slavery today? Would we risk our lives trying to escape to freedom? If we were one of the master class would we speak out or hide a runaway slave as one of the townswomen did? At risk of your husbands job or your own reputation? Back in those times reputation was very important.Harriet Jacobs voice speaks as clearly as a 21st Century woman, her writing is not \"old\" or \"antique\". What happened to her and to all slaves brought to this country should never have happened. When you read this book it will change you. A look at slavery from the slaves point of view. Maks you wonder how people can be so cruel?? A couragious herone that refused to give up and finally triumphed dispate major chellanges. Kept me reading. This is a gripping story of a bygone era. Jacobs writes in excellent English (with the help of Maria Child, an abolitionist) and makes you feel you are living through her ordeal together with her.I have learned a few bizzare things through this book. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 allowed slave owners to track down their slaves even in the \"free\" northern states. A slave could \"buy him/herself\" from his/her owner to gain freedom! I always knew money could buy (almost) everything, but it never occurred to me someone might need to buy oneself.It was also interesting for me to see how attitudes of slave owners to their \"property\" could vary so significantly. Some treated slaves as part of the family. Most however cared for them as you would care for a dog: you feed them and call a doctor if needed, even go to the same Church, but never consider them humans. Seeing Linda's life through her eyes shows that God continues to work in strange ways. How fortunate we are. I am grateful that her message is still being read. I tried this book as a new user of the kindle and have greatly enjoyed the story of Linda and her family in their struggles for emancipation. She writes with a rhythmic and poetic grace that gives a realistic view of old fashioned and out dated ideas and laws. The brutality and viciousness of slave owners and their followers is graphic and harrowing and yet stated so matter of factly from the weary view of someone who has witnessed and been a victim of these horrors as a normal and frequently practiced solution to controlling and owning a people. This is a great read!It has suspense and emotion tinged with history . Very enlightening and educational. Tells the untold truths of this era. Fast shipping, book was in excellent condition except for a dent in the cover. Brand new. I have a lot of time now to read this before classes start. Woohoo! VERY interesting and different perspective on a slaves life...Hard to believe this really happened, yet you still believe the story..."

         "The Lena Baker Story",
         "The story of Lena Baker, the first and only woman to be executed legally in the state of Georgia, needed to be told.Lena was an impoverished Black woman who lived in Cuthbert, the seat of Randolph County, in southwest Georgia. She lost control of her life because, in addition to her station, of two facts. A prominent white man insisted she be his mistress, and she was dependent on alcohol.When she killed her oppressor in self-defense, she was tried for murder. Did she receive a fair trial? Was her case given an adequate investigation? Was she assigned a competent defense attorney?The exploration of these questions makes Phillips's The Lena Baker Story an absorbing one, but even more engaging are the minute details the reader learns of small-town, Southern life in the 1940s. We are told what is playing at the movies. We know that one Cuthbert resident drove all the way to Eufala, Alabama, to buy her pet bird cherry cokes. We know what most folks had for dinner.This book is highly recommended for its general appeal and to any student of the history of jurisprudence, of the civil rights of Blacks and women, of Americana, or of Georgia history. Lela Bond Phillips's recounting of this once forgotten miscarriage of justice is a gripping story well told in its sparse yet lively style covering barely 120 pages. While others would have padded the book with trial transcripts and other ephemera Phillips sticks to the facts of the case painting a warts and all portrait of Lena Baker, the accused murderer and her relationship with Ernest White, the victim. Phillips is unsparing in the depiction of the events leading to the murder as well as well as providing background information on all the major characters as events unfold. Phillips does an outstanding job of explaining how the standards of crime scene investigation and forensic evidence of the era were not as rigorous as they are now and points out the inherent contradictions in the testimony and evidence presented at trial. Phillips studiously avoids making judgments and is careful to point out that readers should not use contemporary standards to judge the characters and their actions. The unflattering and unemotional depiction of an interracial relationship gone wrong in the Jim Crow South has the potential for overwrought prose, but Phillips keeps that in check, largely due to her writing ability (she has an MA in English). In fact her style of writing is well suited for historical writing even though here she is writing out-of-field.When printed in 1998 this book generated renewed interest in the case and efforts to mark Ms. Baker's grave and obtain a pardon from the Board of Parole and Pardons was undertaken. Those efforts bore fruit on August 15, 2005 when the Board posthumously pardoned Ms. Baker. The pardon is a small consolation as she was electrocuted 60 years ago in Georgia's electric chair; the only woman to be put to death. This book is highly recommended for those interested in exploring the Jim Crow era of the South, Georgia History, and real life crime stories. Phillips's style of writing is very enjoyable and this book is a lively page turner that will give you a better understanding of the times."

         "Drug Warriors and Their Prey: From Police Power to Police State",
         "This book is an anomaly amidst the typical drug policy literature available. Miller's argument stems from his scholarship on Nazism. He applies Raul Hilberg's \"chain of destruction\" to the current \"war,\" not on drugs, but on drug users. William Bennett was less than secretive about his abhorrence for those who used drugs, especially those \"hard-core users who were too far gone to care about\" - stated differently, the real issue is not the drugs themselves, but the type of people who use drugs. America is full of social problems, e.g. poverty, crime, &c.; problems that most politicians are timid in addressing because of the complexities involved in solving them. Yet, politicians need a platform to stand on and the American public needs a scapegoat. Drug users, that most alien element in the population, according to Miller, are the perfect group to identify, ostracize, confiscate, concentrate, and then annihilate as scapegoats for all the ills in society: in fact this sequence of stages is Hilberg's \"chain of destruction.\" It is from his \"seminal\" study on the Holocaust, later published as: The Destruction of the European Jews, that Hilberg constructed his theory of the chain of destruction. Nazi Germany, like America, was in the throes of profound social discord and the public demanded a scapegoat. The Jews became the literal manifestation of a scapegoat for the German people. Hitler, faced with harsh social problems, exercised his own prejudices to isolate, blame and thus use the Jews as a scapegoat for Germany's problems. It was identification of the scapegoat with a real entity and the eventual acceptance of this scapegoat by a German majority that led to the conceptualization and employment of a \"final solution\" for the riddance of social ills from German society. Miller's argument is provocative, to say the least, in that he sees a direct correlation between the processes of Nazism and the processes of the \"drug warriors.\" Moral indignation when it is directed toward a highly specified group of people can have disastrous consequences. Miller is not the only scholar who has applied the scapegoat theory to drug users in American society, but he is the first to take it to its disturbing, but logical end. I would like not to see the parallels. Any rational and compassionate person should like not to see the parallels. But the parallels are there, and Miller lays them bare in this devastating and meticulous extended analogy.This is an astonishing book. Its thesis is provocative, to say the least, and it may not be for everyone -- but if you've ever wondered if just maybe our current federal drug policy wasn't delivering quite what you'd hoped, crack this book open and prepare to lose sleep."

         "Generals fight the last war. In the last war they were lower ranking officers in charge of troops actually doing the fighting. This gives them a lesson in how wars are fought. Most United States troops are skilled in the fighting of conventional wars. They well understand what the M-1 tanks did in Gulf War I, they understand about air power, logistics, all kinds of things that enable a heavily mechanized army to fight. They proved this well when a much smaller force quickly overcame the much larger Iraqi army in Gulf War II.Unfortunately winning on the battlefield in Iraq and in Afghanistan didn't mean the end of the war. Instead, as we all know, the real battle was just beginning, and we haven't done very well with it.Dr. Rothstein, a West Point graduate and a thirty year career Special Forces officer uses this book to explain how unconventional warfare has not received the attention it should in the modern military. He uses the experience in Afghanistan to illustrate the points he is describing and makes several recommendations as to how the unconventional forces of the US need to be improved, mostly at the command level."

         "First, for Roger in Las Vegas...if your review is for real, and you went around dressed as a ninja, you were asking for it.For the fellow in Seattle...sorry to hear that. In the US, 75% of the time a martial artist goes to court, they lose. Public perception (even in cases of self defense) is, \"That karate guy didn't have to beat up that guy (or guys) so bad.\"As for the book, a most interesting history lesson indeed. As for the techniques in the book, as a reviewer stated here no one is going to become a fighter by reading a book about it.I did find the illustrations (pencil sketches) most interesting in that quite often the victim is made to look like a Crusader with a huge cross on his shirt. Unlike other martial arts books, the knife techniqures are also illustrated with the knife being plunged into someone's body. There's no doubt the illustrations are to teach Islam's view of all \"infidels\" along with the techniques. If you don't think so, check out the illustration of the captive in a cage or box, and the assassin standing over him holding a knife....and the captive's head.(The only other time I've seen such ilustrations was in a translated KGB manual and victims were shown in US Army uniforms, with 1st CAV. Div. patches).I will say this for the book- at least it doesn't start out with 25 lapel grabs and other such things geared for 1800's Japan. In comparison to the run of the mill martial art book, it's a book on bare-handed assassination techniques and knife techniques. We are definitley not talking \"dojo ballet\" here."

         "Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays",
         "This book is written in a very clear and engaging style. Though parts of some of the essays require some background in philosophy, the issues tackled (such as feminism and multiculturalism) are relevant to anyone who cares about the cultural and intellectual life of this country. Susan Haack is a pragmaticist. Don't let the label fool you. Notice I wrote pragmatICIST, not pragmaTIST. The difference, you ask? Well, in contradistinction to Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnams 'pragmatism' which stresses anti-science and devalues terms like 'objectivity' and 'truth,' Haack is a philosophical descendent of Charles Peirce and John Dewey (begrudginly, I'll throw William James' name in, but that's a stretch). These essays are brilliant defences of the pragmaticist vision of truth, scientific method (or, if we like, methods) and objective knowledge.If all that sounds too philosophical to the average reader, it most likely is not. Haack writes with a down to earth style, a sparkling British wit and a very even flow; especially considering the complexity of some ideas expressed in these pages. It should be mentioned though that although topics covered in these essays include multiculturalism, feminist epistemology, sham reasoning and relativism, this book is much more philosophical in nature than others. Haack is not just another author throwing down the 'science wars' gauntlet (not that it hasn't been thrown down enough already). Whereas most books attacking the abuses of feminism, relativism and postmodern thinking in science, while rightfully exposing their disasterous consequences, end up more as social commentary than actual reasoned arguments; and nary a philosophical arguemt is launched. This is precisely the void that Haack so flawlessly fills.Highlites include a brilliantly constructed 'panel' discussion between 1800's pragmaticist Charles S. Peirce and modern neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty. Haack constructed the dialogue using exerpts of their work and she does a beautiful job making it feel like a discussion. Also, the essay 'Puzzling Out Science' and 'Science as Social' do an excellent job showing that science (contrary to the old Baconian and new 'pragmatist' thought) can be both social and individual. The last two essays deviate a bit from the underlying sceince theme, tackling affirmative action and the absurdities of the academy's expectation that professors (along with masters and doctoral students), to achieve noteriety, must argue the most outlandish theories in the most outlandish way. True to form, these essays are not blank social criticisms so common in books today but are well reasoned, philosophical explorations. The only problem with the book is one common to essay collections. The essays tended to repeat themselves from time to time, not only in ideas (towards the end, you WILL be predicting what Haack's next line will be) but in phrasing. Save for that, flawless!"

         "Had purchased this guide over 30 years ago and it's just as inspirational now as it was then. A must have for women in a recovery program of any kind . Love having it on kindle and iPhone so it's always available. Funny thing is that this book was on a freebie table at my seminary, about six or eight months ago. I'm not in recovery, not in the 12-Step program, but I have people in my life who are. Along with a book called \"200 Morning Prayers\" thatI picked up in Bangalore in January, I find \"Each Day A New Beginning\" a great way to start and pace my day. Will be ordering it for Christmas for some of the people on my Christmas list. I received this book as a gift years ago and it is the most inspirational book in my library. I frequently order Each Day as a gift for friends, family, and coworkers as a source for reading and reflecting on eternal truths. What a wonderful little book this is! A friend gave me a copy back in 1988 when she and I were both trying desperately to patch up marriages that had been damaged by our respective husband's abuse of alcohol. I will forever be grateful to her for this gift. The book is not just for women struggling with addictions...it is for all of us who think there is no light at the end of the tunnel.In the beginning, I read a page each night. After awhile I moved on with my life and felt no need to read it. As I have proceeded with my life I have referred to this book each time life seemed bleak, and every single time I have turned to that day's message...it has been EXACTLY the message I needed to hear to make me feel better.I encourage you to purchase this book for yourself and the women who mean a lot to you...and to let its messages become part of your lives. You WILL be better for it. Some days you will find that the messages are obviously directed at women who are recovering from addictions...it doesn't matter...you will still find a sentence in that message that will be worth a pause in your day. It is a very spiritual guide for beginning one's day with words of wisdom to ponder. I highly recommend this book The reading in this book are always just what I need that day. I am buying them to pass on to my girlfriends. This quiet meditation book, has served countless recovering women since innitial printing in 1982. The author, who recieved her Ph.D from the University of Minnesota, was inspired to write the text while working for the Hazelden Treatment Center. She recognized that a woman's recovery can be based on other factors than those that apply to men; and wrote a text for a womens audience. In the book, there is an essay on recovery for each day of the year. These essays are preceded with an appropriate quotation and followed with a suggestion for meditation. I have used this book successfully with many of my clients and highly reccomend it for professional libraries and for the general public. This book Each day a new Beginning has many uses. Not just for AA, it also can be usefull inmany other life situations. The loss of a loved one,depression,and everyday life struggles. Its a book you can read a little at a time and reflect on the message. I enjoy this book and keep it near by, also I keep notes. I love this book! It gives me daily inspiration and a positive attitude to start my day. This isn't just for the recovery program. This is a powerful book with truly powerful insight and is so wonderful! This is a book for any women during a crisis, or a friend in need who is have a serious crisis. They will cherish this book and see a new spark of light during the dark times. I did and I thank the friend who gave it to me..."

         "The Peacegiver: How Christ Offers to Heal Our Hearts and Homes How Christ Offers to Heal Our Hearts and Homes",
         "Wonderful book on Christ & the atonement. I've never been so personally compelled or moved by any book before. Especially meaningful to me, were the parts about how important one's reaction to being mistreated or abused are. For the first time in my life, it seems possible to forgive some of the things that have happened to me. This is a must read for any Christian, but I think especially for anyone who's ever been abused. (not to imply that is the main focus of the book). It started as a story I could relate to. But then it got a little odd, but I pushed through it and it came together and the concept was worth the approach.I thought I understood the atonement, but not like this. There was an example provided that explained the atonement in a completely new way--it was one of those rare occasions where there was a dramatic paradign shift and my traditional understanding was blown away.This new understanding takes away some of the pain for being wronged by someone dear to me and makes it easier to forgive that person. Ferrell does an outstanding job on many levels in this book, yet all angles are about the Atonement of Christ and how to apply it in our lives. First of all, he engages in some very insightful and inspiring scriptural interpretation and gleans life-changing principles (truths about the Atonement) from some unexpected sources -- stories that are often overlooked. Second, he presents them in a framework that is personable to just about anyone and helps the reader to empathize with the characters and their predicament. And third, Ferrell challenges the reader to experience learning of the principles for himself or herself and thus to internalize these principles and become a better person through Christ. I could not recommend too many books more than this one. I had heard about this book for years but just read it this past month. It was wonderful. I felt the book had many insights into the scriptures that I had never thought about before. I am anxious to apply the principles I learned and let my life be blessed by the change the Savior can bring to me by doing so. This book is great at showing how gospel principals can be applied to your life. It teaches gospel principles by way of a parable of a middle age couple and their struggles. The book can help you change your outlook on your loved ones. An easy read that is easy to go back to for more. Great book! It is one of those books that helps you not only want to change to be a better person, but helps you take the necessary actions to do this. i became a new person overnight. this book helped me understand the true value and meaning of love and forgiveness. eternally grateful. If you have a spiritual nature or are interested in a different approach in further understanding the atonement, I have not read anything that has touched me more. The atonement is illuminated through a unique story line. This is not a doctrinal sermon, it's a story that may teach and/or give new insights. If you currently have anyone in your life that seems to provoke ill feelings in your heart--feelings that perhaps feel totally beyond your control, almost as if they had a life of their own: Then my friends--Look no further! Discovering the &quot;Nineveh-nous&quot; of my heart--not THE OTHER'S heart--changed everything. This book was amazing. It certainly causes one to think twice about judging anyone harshly, creates one to think twice upon reacting to situations as well. It prompted me to dive more into the Old Testament to see how the atonement is applicable in every facet of life. This ranks to be one of my most all-time favorite books. It is worth buying because you will want to read it and re-read it to grasp all of the deep meaning. What an intelligent author who scripts the verses so eloquently."

Shaara could knit quite a yarn and with Longstreet, Chaimberlain, Lee, &amp; Hancock, as just some of the characters psyche's he has you delving into you won't put it down till crossing THE END. I had never heard of this book until I looked at the book list for my college class. It turned out to be a great book and when you have a professor teaching you to read critically you realize how intriguing this book actually is to read. I would recommend it for anyone. I am not much of a fan of historical fiction, but I make an exception for this book. Shaara is so effective at recreating the battle of Gettysburg that you often forget that its a novel. The authenticity is absolutely amazing. The book was used as the basis for TNT's superior film &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; and it is easy to see why. Shaara's descriptions are so vivid, they're like screenwriting just waiting to be filmed. Just like the movie, Union Colonel Joshua Chamberlain is the most memorable character. His story, like this book is for anyone who wants to know what it truly means to be an American. amazingly readable for a history.very hard to put down. the only downside is appearace of maps on original Kindle. don't miss this. I have little to add to the raves but this:Despite a good education, I had little other than a cursory knowledge of the Civil War until I read this book, a quarter-century ago. I spent the next five years reading everything I could find on the nation's seminal event.Thank you, Michael Shaara I cannot estimate how favorably hard-core Civil War buffs would receive this historical novel, but as someone with limited knowledge around historical context, battle strategies, major players, and sequence of events, this book has truly whet the appetite. The book is not packed full of technical details. Rather, it offers an engaging (but not exhaustive) description of events in the battle of Gettysburg, descriptions that are provided from the perspective of several major players (Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Buford). It provides insight not simply into the chain of events that transpired, but also into the proclivities, thought processes, and characters of the Generals that played a major role in these events. The book focuses on the events over a 5-day period, June 29-July 3, 1863. Absolutely brilliant piece of work. I borrowed it from my brother--if/when I return it to him I will be buying a copy for myself. This book represents American historical storytelling at it's finest. An absolultely divine page-turner; one of the most profound insights on the Civil War I have read. This book presents history in a compelling manner that is easy to read but still encapsulates the thoughts and emotions comprising the American Civil War. It is beautifully divided into chapters aptly named after the officers they portray. Each character's experiences jump through the reader to give him an understanding of the common themes of the North and the South. Common themes including the reasoning behind the war, specifically slavery or state's rights and family against family, and friend against friend are presented in manner that exonerates the humanity of both points of view. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in American history, military history, American philosophy, or just interesting reading. This truly is one of the best books I have ever read. The author's ability to humanize people (who have only been historical figures to me) is amazing. Have always been interested in the Civil War, but am now ready to pack my bags and see Gettysburg. While reading the book, I felt I was on the battlefield, taking part. Although it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1975, Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels\" (1974) was little-noted when it first appeared. The stature of the book has grown with time. It was used in a television series of the Civil War and in a movie version of the Battle of Gettysburg. The novel has been criticized on various grounds. Sharra's factual account of the battle and the importance he ascribes to Little Round Top can be challenged. Shaara focuses too much on the high command of the two armies and gives too little attention to the soldiers in the ranks. Shaara minimizes the importance of slavery to the conflict. For all these criticisms, this book remains a moving account of Gettysburg. It will continue to introduce many Americans to the Battle and encourage them to reflect and get beyond some of the factual limitations of the book. The book is taught in history and literature classes and properly so as it introduces new generations of Americans to their history. It has also appeared in this relatively new Modern Library edition to replace the old dog-eared paperback. The remainder of this review is drawn primarily from the review I wrote some time ago of the earlier edition.This is an outstanding work of historical fiction. The book deserves the praise it has received. There is much more to this novel than can be captured in any movie or TV series on the Civil War. The book is a fitting introduction to the Civil War and to the Battle of Gettysburg. The book illustrates a lesson too easily forgotten --how fiction, creatively done, has the power to give meaning to fact.The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1 -- July 3, 1863. Although some students of the Civil War tend to downplay its importance to the result of the conflict in favor of the the surrender of Vicksburg to Grant on July 4, 1863, Gettysburg remains a pivotal event in the war. It has been written about endlessly.Michael Shaara's novel is in four large chapters, one for each day of the battle together with an introductory chapter setting the stage. The story is told in sections devoted alternately to the perspectives and roles of many of the leading protagonists: the Confederate Commanding General Robert E. Lee, his \"old war horse\" the controversial James Longstreet, and Lewis Armistead, more of whom below. Shaara also describes the British military attache Freemantle, who was a guest in the Confederate camp during the battle and who wrote an important memoir describing his experience. On the Union side Shaara focuses on Joshua Chamberlain, a bookish college professor from Maine who became the hero of Little Round Top, and General John Buford, the cavalry commander whose actions delayed the Confederate advance at the outset of the battle.There are many excellent historical studies of the Battle of Gettysburg. The most important is the long study by Edward Coddington. Both Steven Sears and Noah Trudeau have written two recent extended studies of the battle. Detailed specialized studies have been written on every aspect of the battle including Buford's role on the first day, Little Round Top on the second day, and Pickett's charge on the third day. These and other works make difficult, challenging reading. It is worth thinking about how such studies differ in intent and content from the novelistic portrayal of the Battle of Gettysburg in \"The Killer Angels.\"The novel gives a vivid picture of each of the three days of the battle, but it is more selective, focused picture than we get in the histories. The novel concentrates on the events on Little Round Top -- the far left of the Union line on the second day of the battle, July 2. The hero is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain and his men from the twentieth Maine who hold of a furious Confederate charge over the boulders of Little Round Top led by William Oates of Mississippi and help save the Union position. Many years after the battle, Chamberlain and Oates would write extensively about Little Round Top and correspond with each other. Some historians tend to discount the importance of Little Round Top to the result at Gettysburg. Whether or not they are correct, Shaara's novel shows the human drama of the battle in the way a narrative history generally cannot. He captures the heroism on both sides at this revered site.The novel also concentrates on Pickett's doomed charge on the third day of Gettysburg. He offers a portrayal of General Lewis Armistead, one the the three Confederate General's serving in General Pickett's division. In the pre-Civil War army, Armistead had been a great friend of the Union General, Winfield Scott Hancock who performed admirably on each of the three days of Gettysburg. Armistead died after crossing the Union line in the charge and, as legend has it, with his dying breath asked for Hancock's forgiveness.The novel form allows the writer to concentrate on specific scenes, as Shaara does well in \"The Killer Angels\", to a degree the historian cannot. The novel also allows the writer freedom to explore introspectively. The novelist may describe the thoughts of the protagonists to a degree that goes beyond the historical record. Sharra exploits this possibility to the utmost. He gives the reader interchanges between Lee and Longstreet, for example, that are entirely plausible, that make them come alive, and that cast great light upon their activities and motivations during the Battle. We see a great deal of Colonel Chamberlain, of course. The reader hears Sharra recreating Chamberlain's innermost thoughts and is encouraged to think about the making of a hero.The novelistic form also allows Sharaa to use characters to express their views of the meaning of the War. Sharaa gives the reader a picture of what both sides thought they were fighting for and invites the reader to think further about the Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg and their significance.This novel will not replace historical studies for those interested in learning more about the Civil War or about the details of the Battle of Gettysburg. But it is a thoroughly admirable novel which captures something of the harshness and the heroism of the War and of the American character. It will give the careful reader a good understanding, or a good way to work through to an understanding, of the events of these three days in 1863. \"The Killer Angels\" will encourage the reader to deepen his or her appreciation of, our country's history.Robin Friedman Years before I knew about this book, I saw the movie, &quot;Gettysburg.&quot; It was four hours long and felt as if it were over in an instant. I've rented it three times since then, and finally purchased it. My local book-review club members reminded me about &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; and I purchased it. It was tremendous -- I could hardly put it down, and then my husband started reading it and felt the same way about it. It's interesting that the book, which came first, is so nearly identical to the screenplay. To me, that attests to the quality of the author's writing as much as to the good judgment of the producer and director of the movie. Excellent book. Wonderful insight into the battle at Gettysburg. As a result of reading this book I have a much clearer perception of the generals representing the north and the south during this conflict. It is also a great read to find out more about the strategy employed by both sides and the lack of agreement in both camps about how these stratageies were to be executed. Much of what I learned in history classes relating to this battle and the civil war in general was contradicted. Great book and great service. Killer angels arrived in France before I expected, was read and well enjoyed. Thank you, John This is a great book. If you are a civil war buff, it puts you right in the thick of things. It is well written. I highly recommend it. Novelizations of real events usually do not interest me much. I'd rather have the \"non-fiction\" historically researched work instead in most cases. \"Killer Angels\" is an exception. Compelling and fast-moving and thoroughly credible, it is a great introduction to the Civil War for those who have not yet become hooked on the work of historians. Mr. Shaara died too soon, but his son has carried on his peculiar contribution to American history, and done so almost as well as his father did. At times in this wonderful novel the author's narrative approaches the realm of poetry--sometimes I had to read a line several times, so great was its beauty. Don't let the word &quot;poetry&quot; turn you off, however. This is not a ponderous, pedantic novel. It is an absorbing, rich read and a painless source of detailed knowledge about the Battle of Gettysburg. Oops! I just posted a review for this book under Gods and Generals. Anyways, this is an excellent book that I think that anyone could enjoy. It's been called the best Civil War novel ever written and I would have to agree with that review. The Killer Angels was an exciting Historical Fiction Novel based on the Battle of Gettysburg. It focuses on certain people that were important at the battle. I loved this book so muck I bought the whole series. The main characters in this book come alive. As I turned the pages it's as if I could feel the sun beating down on my back in those July days of 1863. I sensed the fear the soldiers must have had as they contemplated the charge that ended the battle. I felt the fatique of Robert E Lee, the humble courage of Joshua Chamberlain, and the pain of Armistead as he lay there dying, thinking of his old friend. If you are wondering about what it felt like to be at Gettysburg, read this book. A MUST READ for all Americans. The Army War College in Carlisle, PA uses this marvelous work as the background for its Staff Ride program on the Gettysburg encounter. The future of both the Republic and the Confederacy hinged on many parts of this battle. I also grew to admire Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain for his quiet leadership and faithfulness to his men, be they from Maine or elsewhere. I have worn out, or given away to friends, at least a dozen copies of this book as hooks into study of this critical period in our history. It belongs in every library and history classroom. THe Killer Angels makes the battle of Gettysburg come alive for the reader. Shaara takes historical facts and injects the human dimension which makes the novel both educational and a page turner. Highly recommend that people of all ages read this masterpiece and immerse themselves in the most turbulent period of our nation's history. This was one of the best, if not the best, historical novels I've ever read. I often read books on WWI, WWII, but usually they are histories or biographies. I've wanted to read some books on the Civil War, but I decided to start with a highly recommended historical novel instead of the usual histories. I think this was a good move, because this book really piqued my interest, and it sent me several times onto the Internet to look up several things including maps and biographies about people that were more in depth.Michael Shaara wrote beautifully. It's been a long time since I've read a book with such descriptive phrasing that drew pictures of the battleground. I've been to Gettysburg, since I live in Pittsburgh...Shaara was able to describe how lush and green the farmlands around the area is, and what it is like in summer mornings when dew is on the grounds and fog lies in the trees. The book makes you want to cry when you think of men facing each other in battle, and so many of them actually knew each other on the other side. Readers will spend a lot of time with their heart in their throat reading this book...you are glad our country won't have to go through another war like this one, it was so neccessary but so devastating.I learned so much from this book, so much that I want to learn more. It never occurred to me that the British were thinking that if the South won, they could just come in and take over again like the Revolution had never happened. The men of the South were very courageous, and many of them were not fighting for slavery but for state rights and other reasons. It was much more complicated than I thought. You end up feeling a lot of sorrow for not just the men who were killed needlessly, but for the men who had to send so many into battle, for Robert E Lee who was very ill at Gettysburg, and I ended up feeling bad for the women of the South because I read elsewhere that many young women never married because so many prime young men died in the Civil War there was nothing for them to choose from. It's the same thing that happened after WWI in England.I will be reading more on this topic thanks to this book...(Warning: Book had maps which you can't see on Kindle very well) Fast delivery, item delivered as described. I would buy from this seller again and recommend this seller to others. This novel has no words to describe it...it is truly wonderful. I read it in the 7th grade...before our class fieldtrip to Gettysburg and I loved it so much..I bought the rest of the series. It may look long...but doesn't take long to finish. It taught me a lot about Gettysburg...now I'm like a book on it!! And if you like it...Care to watch the Movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;..Based on the Killer Angels. It is one of my FAVORITE BOOKS =D The Shaara writing style clearly enhances the historical facts and you can more easily comprehend the actual steps in the various confrontations on the battlefields.. This is probably the best I have read on the Gettysburg. This is the only book so far I removed from my kindle as I thought it was hard to follow. I finished the book in its entirety but I just didnot like the book the way I thought I would. For one I would liked more on the civil war rather rather than so many pages on all the different generals and their personalities.No right now I donot want the book back. The Killer Angels provides insight into the very men that shaped our country's history. It stripped away all the preconceived notions of the slave mongering, and morally decrepit Confederate Army. Many characters in this book could simply not fight against their family, even thought they swore an oath at Westpoint to defend the Union. Others merely wanted to defend their states' honor. Others believed that it was their constitutional right to govern themselves that they were fighting for.It is very possible that the underlying cause for the War was slavery, but not because men hungered to own other men as property.I have read some reviews by people for whom this book was required reading, and they have not been fair reviews. I truly feel sorry for anyone who does not have the capacity to understand this fine work of literature. And it is certainly Literature. This book is written so that you may glimpse into the mind of men with great burdens upon them, and makes you one of them. At the end of this book I had a lump in my throat because I feel now I can better understand the enormity of the burden these men faced.Read this book. You owe it to yourself. Whether you are interested in the Civil War, or any war for that matter. Recently, I read another great War novel, the Louise Maude translation of Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\". THAT was the greatest book I've ever read. This one is also a sensational read--and I'm not one who is usually into war. Shaara's device of picking a few main characters and following them around is well done. It's an interesting read and totally recommended. I would say my one desire had been that he remind us at the start of every new big chapter which side each of the players are on. Small quibble, kind of like wishing that Gabriel Garcia-Marquez had not named so many characters Arianlo in \"100 Years of Solitude\". If you have the slightest interest in the Civil War, don't fail to read the late Michael Shaara's book \"The Killer Angels\". It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1974.For some reason this book had never crossed my path. It wasn't until Father's Day this year that I was even aware of its existence. My 27 year old son gave me a DVD that had both Gods and Generals and Gettysburg on it. In reading the jacket of the DVD I saw the movie was based on this book. After watching the movie, I headed off to the library. I was not disappointed.This volume shows both the courage and determination of the Union and Confederate soldiers. It examines the story from both viewpoints. You are told the story through the key leadership of the battle. You will read about Robert E. Lee. You will learn what his decisions were based on. You will see why he was so beloved by his army. The book allows you to be present as Lee struggles with decision after decision from his headquarters. You can feel the frustration of Longstreet as he tries to convince Lee that defense is a better choice. You will get a picture of the flamboyant Pickett. You will feel Lee's and Longstreet's frustration with J.E.B. Stuart. I met a new hero in the book - Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin as I read about the 20th Maine Regiment and Chamberlain who with a bayonet charge on Little Big Top held the end of the Union line. Another new hero I encountered was General John Buford. You will experience his anguish as he decides to engage Rebel forces. He knows that he was seriously outnumbered. He is determined to save the only high ground in the area.I was emotionally involved in the book from the beginning to the end. This is the book that blurs the line between historical fiction and creative non-fiction. It is simply great reading. While the movie was good, the book is great. Michael Shaara had the vision, did the research, and wrote one of the best books ever. Thank you! Shaara has produced a rare gem: a novel that educates, entertains, saddens, and elightens all at once. His history is sharp and well researched, without sacrificing story or character. Shaara makes historical figures who have often been villified or deified into people. By the end of the novel I had a deeper understanding of the motivations and significance of the Civil War, and its military leaders, than any history class could give me. I wish other writers would take the time an d effort to write character driven books about other great battles in history. Shaara's &quot;Killer Angels&quot; stands alone as a great read but when read in conjunction with his son's &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; and now &quot;Last Full Measure&quot;, it takes on even greater significance as a window into the events and persons of our Civil War. For me, it introduced me to Joshua Chamberlain--and I've been in awe of him ever since Michael Shaara takes us through the Battle of Gettysburg in sharp detail from start to finish. Not knowing that Ted Turner's film Gettysburg was based on this book, it became obvious after just a few pages. As I recall, the film is true to Shaara's book. Shaara's characters are presented brilliantly from start to finish; these are the men who defined the course of our nation during this bloody encounter in Pennsylvania. Shaara's novel is a painless way for us to learn about this important event in American history. When all is said and done, Shaara's book reminds us at a time when we sit on the brink of war that, as always, &quot;war is hell.&quot; In my opinion Michael Shaara has created a masterpiece that has no equal. He explains in such detail the events of the battle of Gettysburg,But at the same time shows us the people, not just a number on a casualty report but the way the people were when they wern't off fighting and being brave and dying valiantly for what they believed to be right and just. Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of historical fiction. Michael Shaara's Pulitzer-Prize winning Killer Angels is so good that I make an exception in its case. The book works on a variety of levels, which in my opinion separates it from the rest of the genre.On one level is the story of the battle of Gettysberg itself, which Shaara does an exemlpary job of describing. On another level is the complex interaciton of personalities - characters based on real people, many of whom had been educated together at West Point, served together in peace and war and who were close friends before the Civil War began. A third level uses the battle itself as a microcosm for the Civil War, exploring the various motivations behind participants from both north and south.The book is truly a masterpiece of fiction. The drama created by Shaara's dialogue is enhanced by real events, but the real genius of the story is its many facets. I recommend this book to anyone -serious civil war buff or those simply looking for a good book to engross themselves in. You won;t be disappointed. After many years of interest in the history of the Civil War I was amazed to be surrounded by the characters that were there. The lifelike and authentic portrayal of the people and events was wonderful. This novel was an absorbing emotional experience lending some understanding to the question of how so many casualties could have occured in such a short time. This reads well; I found myself engaged with the action and the characters at all times. Both sides of the conflict were portrayed fairly whether north, south or officers or enlisted men or volunteers. The reader becomes aware of the personal hardship, the thrill of going into battle and the terrible waste of human life. It seemed most of the men saw this as an issue of the states' right to be independent of the national government; but as the conflict continued and they all became farther from their own homes and saw more of slavery in action, emancipation rose in importance. LIke many people, I saw the movie Gettysburg before I read Michael Shaara's book. As much as I loved the film, the book is even better! What I appreciated the most was Shaara's way of showing both the Northern and Southern viewpoints equally. He avoided the politically correct trap of demonizing the South, and instead gave a thougtful explanation of why the South felt it was right in breaking off from the United States and taking up arms in defense of it's lands.Two of my heros from the War Between the States are Longstreet and Chamberlain. this book charts their actions during this campaign is a way that helps the reader understand not just what they did, but WHY they did what they did. Any student of the history of the War Between the States should ready this book for it's study of the characters involved in the conflict. Even though it is a work of fiction, it brings the major players of the Gettysburg campaign alive in a way that no other author has yet achieved.This is an outstanding book, and should be required reading in all college-level American History classes. Had the opportunity to read this twice before (I was hooked the first time!) With other good books piling up, figured the best way to \"review\" Killer Angels was to listen to it on tape while driving on business. Was not disappointed. Previous comments about the READER had given me some misgivings. And yes, perhaps Lionel Barrymore could have been a wee bit better.....but the reading was top notch and faithful to the story.Noticed just a couple a areas where the story dragged just a bit; this was not apparent to me when I was actually reading the novel. Nevertheless, the entire presentation was a great experience, from the prologue to the epilogue.HIGHLY RECCOMMEND this book, regardless of the format. And after you've read it maybe you'll be like me, and visit both Gettysburg and the Maine home and burial site of Joshua Chamberlain. I was made to read this in High School and it opened my eyes to historical fiction. One of my favorites. One of two books read in my entire lifetime that I consider a masterpiece.This book's language is sweet, smooth-flowing, stunning in its simplicity and focus. The Battle of Gettysburg is well documented and has been written about since July 4, 1863..... but to someone unversed in warfare and battlefields, it brought home the bravery, certainty and uncertainty, fear, foolishness, conflicts, nobility, and humanity of the men struggling to survive the 3 days in Pennsylvania that turned the tide of the war.I loved the structure of the novel - alternating chapters among the key figures of the war - Lee, Chamberlain, Longstreet, Buford, Armistead, The Spy, Freemantle. I appreciated the maps, the brief biographical notes at the beginning of the novel and the afterward describing the principal characters lives after the war.I want to learn more about Longstreet and Chamberlain particularly and want to see Gettysburg.I'm not sure I could have appreciated this book at any earlier time in my life so am grateful that I've read it now. The book started out by what seemed like trudging thorugh mud. About 1/3 way through, it started to get very interesting. A worthwile read! Actually, I've been meaniing to review this book for quite some time. This is one of my favorite civil war books.Anyone who was totally confused by the lack of presence of Buford in the movie and who doesn't own the director's cut will find more of his actions in the book.Historically, it is fairly accurate. Of course, only diary excerpts and letters can recount the conversations, etc., and they are usually not exact, word-for-word retellings. Some of the conversations used in the book were taken from retellings by one of the participants. General Ewell and RE Lee, for instance. Others are completely created dialogue. It's impossible to know which if you are not a civil war expert, which I am not.The Killer Angels is a wonderful place to start. A very good Michael Shaarah book that everyone should read to get a perspective on the Civil War. This Pulitzer Prize winning novel captures the Civil War battle of Gettysburg from both the Union and the Confederate side in an interesting and informative way. Each chapter forcuses on a General - alternating with the Blue and the Gray. Although I have visited Gettsburg and read much on the Civil War, this particular tale brings it to life in a gripping way that is unmatched by any other. You will love it! And excellent integration of historical fact with a novel which makes for a very good read for anyone interested in the Civil War and the personalities that fought it. Special attention is given to the top members of the Confederate and Union armies command structure as well as the enlisted men and their reasons for fighting this war which remain topics of debate even now. The book centers on the battle of Gettysburg which I have visited several times in Pennsylvania and the author brings to life that battle in no other way by any other author and in an authentic way which will capture the imagination of any Civil War buff. Having just returned from Gettysburg, I decided this would be a good time to read this too long postponed historical novel. Rather than tell a traditional &quot;narrative&quot; of battle, Killer Angels looks at events through the wholly subjective (and incredibly blind) eyes of five participants (contrary to another reviewer, Grant was not involved, and plays no part in this novel).Despite the extreme limitations of knowledge of each of the characters--which characterizes even current military battles, despite increased technology, the reader gets a very good sense of the over all ebb and flow of what happened, why generals made the decisions they did, and how much of war depnds on luck and the unanticipated consequences of decisions made for entirely different reasons.The prime example, which forms the ceterpiece of the book, is Chamberlain's defense of the Union flank at Little Round Top. Having the vastly superior position, but the uneviable job of being the far right of the Union lines, Chambelin finds his troops at dusk without enough bullets to fight off another Confederate charge. Nonetheless, he has orders not to retreat, no mattter what, because if he does, then the Confederates will be able to gain the high gtround from the rear, and the Union position will become untenable.When the Confederates charge, out of complete desperation, Chamberlain orders a bayonette charge. This appears completely suicidal (and Chamberlain probably thought that he was ordering his troops to certain death). Bayonettes in the face of bullets do not have a good track record. However, when the Confederate troops saw the charging Union soldiers, they panicked and retreated. Thus the day was saved, the battle won, and many would say, the course fo the war changed forever. Yet, the decision was made not out of bravery of tactics, but out of desperation.As good as the battle descriptions are, even more powerful are the scenes in which generals on both sides wrestle with the fact that they are issuing orders which will result in thousands of men killing thousands of their fellow citizens, and in many cases, the generals facing each other were good friends before the war. Shaara's strength is making this impossible tragedy make sense, from both sides.Shaara closes his book with a quote from Winston Churchill about how the Civil War was the bloodiest, yet least preventible wars in history. Once the tragic commitment to slavery had been made, Civil War was sure to follow. The result was a massive purging of the great American dilemna through the blood of brothers. &quot;Where were the angels?&quot;, is a question every reader should ask. The minds of men justifying sending thousands of men to their deaths. Only when the father/motherland loses it's sanctity will the horror of war end. While in college, I took a synthesis course on the human response to war. Most of the books we read were World War II and Vietnam. How on Earth this book wasn't included, I have no idea?Sometimes this country takes for granted the Civil War. This book puts everything in perspective. Brother on brother. Generals fighting against their friends. It's the most important war in this country's history and maybe even the world's in the last 1,000 yaers.Read this account about the Battle of Gettysburg to find out why. This is one of the best books I've ever read. It gives an interesting and personal view into the worst war in american history. I found myself understanding and admiring the men in blue and gray. Thought-provoking and mind numbing, whether a civil war buff or just mildly curious, it is both entertaining and educational. A must read. listened to the book on CD after watching the movie \"Gettysburg\" and visiting the battlefield. The whole package was a great experience. Listening to the CD really provided the detail. A+ One of the most brilliant, moving, extraordinary, and beautiful novels I have ever read, The Killer Angels details the events of the Battle of Gettysburg from the perspective of the men who fought it. Union soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is a professor turned soldier that will make a brilliant tactical move out of desperation, a move that not only will win the battle but perhaps the war. Chamberlain is fighting the war to destroy the aristocratic South that has no business owning slaves in the democratic United States, but is also fighting to understand his feeling toward the black man and his role as a soldier. On the Confederate side, James Longstreet is fighting a war he doesn't believe in, knows he cannot win, against his own men and own army, using tactics that he knows will result in massacre and failure. And he can't even quit. Longstreet's ideas are decades ahead of his time and are considered cowardly in this age of Romantic chivalry and honor. This is the story of two armies clashing in an epic battle. One a homogeneous army of white, protestant men fighting for disunion, for their \"rights\", homes, and honor. They fight with morale under a leader they adore. The other, an army deeply varied in customs, religion, language, and color, fighting for the union of the country under the ideal that all men are created equal. This powerful, fascinating and very readable novel brings to life and understanding this momentous, chaotic, complex period of history, brings to life the men who fought this war, brings to life what went through their tortured souls and minds with staggering brilliance. An amazing novel. Grade: A+ The first two-thirds of the book were somewhat of a chore to get through - my initial reaction (to a marketing blurb) was: no way this is better than Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage! Why? Well, Shaara spends the first two days shifting troops around, having protagonists yakking about pretty mundane things, doing pretty everyday things like drinking coffee... there were too many characters (various generals, colonels, officers of both sides) without sufficient depth or emotional connection to each. The prose was also not outstanding.However, once we got to the battle on the third day, it's as if we have a different book. The prose suddenly shone with the poignancy, the cannon sounds, the emotions, the confusion, the pathos of the battlefield. Chapter after chapter, Shaara's pen delivers the most engaging battle scene - not just the mechanics of it, but the emotional and psychological aspect of it - I've read... we connect with Longstreet, Chamberlain, Lee (though like Longstreet, it's hard to forgive him too)... and yes, I now concede defeat to the marketing blurb - Killer Angels is in the end (literally), better than Red Badge of Courage.On that basis (can't comment, don't know enough about, civil war history), it's a five-star. But be ready for a slow trek through the first two days as Shaara sets the stage for the finest battlefield climax yet. I was assigned this book for summer reading for my english class. I saw it was about the civil war and I put it off because I figured I'd have to drag myself through the book. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't put this book down and finished it in 3 days. The success is due to Shaara's excellent skill. He takes the unique approach of telling the story from the view points of me on both sides. This could have been horribly executed if he wrote in a way to vilify one side or another, to make the reader root for the naturally &quot;good&quot;. Shaara goes the authentic route (and does it quite well) by making all of the men real and is able to bring out the personalities in just the writing styles.GREAT BOOK! I was so impressed with Shaara's classic work that it spurred me to write my own novel about the Civil War. While some of the action was a bit overly condensed, which gave me an opening to write more about Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the writing is amazing. The Killer Angels is an excellent starting point for anyone studying the Civil War. I think Robert E Lee was indeed one of the wars greatest generals, but this book shows how age and health can case even the best to deteriorate to near incompetance. Longstreet of course is a rock as always. have listened to tape version,this one is much better throughly enjoyed this one. Have listened several times, ver well done. What a fantastic book. I've always wanted to meet Robert E. Lee, and now I feel I have. Not only did I get a chance to meet the general, I got to meet a whole host of his contemporaries. While Mr. Shaara could not actually read the minds of these long gone figures, he did base his interpretation of their thoughts on surviving correspondence. Nevertheless, it was a masterful stroke to make these characters as fully human as this work does with the limited clues available in their letters and journals.If you have any interest in vicariously taking part in one of this nations most influential historical events, I strongly recommend letting Mr. Shaara be your guide. i didn't know much about Gettysburg except there was an important battle there and President Lincoln made his famous short speech there. But this book gave me a better understanding of what went on. We were visiting there and toured the fields, so it gave me a much better understanding, rather than just looking at monuments. After going up to Little Round Top, then reading how the union soldiers were dug in there and how the rebs were just mowed down as they came up that mountain, I could visualize the battle. The whole thing makes me think how sad and useless is war. So many young American men and boys killed. Michael Shaara has captured the very essense of the most important three days in American history. From the first word until the last, the reader is gripped by the drama and humanity of the battle of Gettysburg.Historically accurate, painstakingly researched, and flawlessly executed, The Killer Angels puts you on the battlefield and leaves you breathless.This book is a must reading for anyone who truly cares about American history. I was always interested in Americas' Civil War and had read some excellent books on the subject such as \"A Brotherhood of Valor\", \"Through Blood and Fire at Gettysburg\", \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" but \"The Killer Angels\" is a very special one.Late Michael Shaara has performed an excellent research on private papers of this battle protagonist. Based on this material he produce a griping story, presenting the men that march to the tragic encounter, with their ideals, memories, sorrows, doubts & hopes.He follows Generals Lee and Longstreet, Colonel Chamberlain amongst others, penetrating their most intimate thoughts in a way the reader can't avoid wondering how this is possible.Mr. Shaara does not pick sides, he presents the reader with the confronting \"Cause\", which every man into the field believes to be just, and for which is willing to shed his blood. The valor and self sacrifice these men deploy, is reflected in each page of this incredible good book.Enough maps are shown enabling the reader to follow the displacement of the armies in the field.For the readers interested in this matter, Michael's son, Jeff, has written \"Gods & Generals\" and \"The Last Full Measure\" telling the events preceding and following this crucial struggle.A great stuff to be read by history buffs or casual readers. Enjoy!!!.Reviewed by Max Yofre. This book was one of the most incredible pieces of literature I have ever read. I have visited the battlefield at Gettysburg several times as a child but never really contemplated what occured there, but after reading this book I shall visit again with awe and reverence. This books moves to tears, stirs the heart and the soul, and finally, lifts one to a greater understanding of men in battle. The writing of the battles of Little Round Top and the description of Pickett's charge actually left me breathless and time seemed to stop as I read these passages. Well, anyway, this was one heck of a read. A truly amazing work. Recommended for anyone with an interest in the Civil War (obviously) but also for anyone with a desire to know the human spirit. If you have recently read &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; because its been a popular pick by the book clubs or in anticipation of the upcoming movie release, you will likely hear about &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. I had heard from a number of people that Cold Mountain was the best book of the Civil War genre since Killer Angels and one of the reviews in the book jacket for Cold Mountain comments similarly. I'm not a Civil War fan or a history buff and yet I was very much moved by what I read. If you don't like history or the Civil War as a subject, do not let it put you off from reading this book. Shaara brings the story to life so well and with such facility that you become engrossed in the novel. He almost supercedes the subject itself. Its a shame he hasn't written more 'historical novels'. His ability to put you into the perspective and the minds of the Generals and Officers involved in the conflict is second to none. Sir Walter Scott was the originator of the historical novel genre, but I haven't read anyone as good as Shaara. I can understand now why it won a Pulitzer and I would certainly expect that 100 or 200 years from people will view Shaara's work with the same reverence they view the classic novels now. Every once in a while you read a book that simply moves you as a person, that changes your perspective and your understanding of the world around you. This is one of those books. I enjoy history novels as they provide lessons from the past to navigate the shoals of the present. They do so in an entertaining way. Known and unknown, two sides of the same coin, the currency of war, could benefit from history when making `either-or' decisions. Without it, beyond a coin flip, unknown has the upper hand in shaping not only the strategy but he outcome of at least the battle and on occasion the war, including why you fought it. In this review I conclude with lessons learned than may be applied to decisions you make in November 2012.In our American Civil War, the troops from both sides were converging on Gettysburg, neither side knowing exactly who or how many as late as the day before the first day of the battle. Then there was the dynamic of what to believe from your Scouts. Lee suffered from this in two ways. He didn't trust his spies, and he trusted General Stuart of the Confederate Calvary was out doing anything but following orders. Buford's Calvary was, based on limited intelligence and counting on battle instinct, already digging in on Cemetery Hill and Lee discounted that information as being a Militia of townspeople. This author portrays the first shot early morning of Gettysburg came from a picket line soldier from Buford's Calvary acting on Buford's orders into the advancing Rebel Army.The first day...Buford's stand held the Rebels at bay long enough for Union reinforcement to arrive and hold the high ground While Buford's acts were courageous and strategic, two dynamics made the difference. First General Lee, not having accurate intelligence as to who was on Cemetery Hill, gave orders to proceed with caution. The orders were due to the unknown that should have been known had his Cavalry General Stuart followed orders and already been to Gettysburg. This combined with General Ewell freezing `like a pond in the dark\" gave the Confederates the town of Gettysburg, but left the advantageous high ground to the Union Army. It was an inverse predicament to Fredericksburg, where the Confederate Army held the high ground and prevailed. Like Fredericksburg, there was too much momentum to reverse the pending conflict. The unknown set the stage for unmerciful carnage.Lee's second day strategy dealt with some known and unknowns. He knew the first day's victory was due to numeric superiority against a Union Army that was just beginning to form, unbeknownst to him. He gave instruction to his Generals to proceed to Gettysburg with caution. Not having surveyed the town with that order he was not aware of the importance of achieving high ground immediately south of the town. Arriving in Gettysburg during the first day's battle he gave orders to General Ewell to take Cemetery Hill, the first hill. Ewell froze; they had the advantage in terms of battle momentum but did not take Cemetery Hill.This allowed Union forces to dig, and bought time to replenish and reinforce in mass. Had General Stuart's Calvary been available Lee would have had advance lay of the land and knowledge of Union troop strength. Instead of an order to preceed with caution, Lee would likely have stated Cemetery Hill and all high ground as an objective. Failures of Stuart and Ewell left the Rebels with a captured town and the Union digging in on high ground.Lee's second day strategic orders were an `en echelon' assault. Longstreet's orders were to sweep right and attack Cemetery Hill by surprise. In the middle of his march he realized he needed a different route than planned. This took extra time. When they were finally in position his army was tired from the march before and General Hoods regiment was facing a charge up a hill where the hill alone wad insurmountable. Both Hood and Longstreet knew at this time. Had Lee held better intelligence in the morning, an attack from the rear would have been included in the morning orders. Missing was intelligence that would have come from Stuart. What was missing was Stuart that would have carried out Lee's orders.The folly of day one battle was a clear display of undisciplined orders leading to lack of intelligence. Lomgstreet knew Lee's strategy was flawed. He had the intelligence of a spy that Lee gave half hearted attention to. With General Stuart gallivanting his cavalry across Pennsylvania, not in accord with Lee's orders, he gave Longstreet orders to attack straight up Cemetery Ridge. But Longstreet insisted on following Lee's morning orders. On day one the battlefield intelligence was much better in the afternoon than the morning, but the orders of the morning prevailed. Communications in that era did not allow for change in strategy. Strict army discipline let orders get in the way.The high ground, creative initiative, and shear instinctive courage gave Colonel Chamberlain's Maine regiment gave the Union army a strategic battle second day victory that forced an even more difficult battle plan for Lee on the third and final day of the battle of Gettysburg. In the days leading up to Chamberlain's march to Gettysburg he was ordered to discipline Union deserters from his home state of Maine. He could not find it within him to shoot them so he gave them a speech to convince them to join his regiment. The result was an additional 200 men that would prove essential in defending the Rebel charge up Cemetery Ridge on day one.The Rebels charged up the hill with what seemed to Chamberlain's regiment and infinite supply of men. They came in waves and drained the Union army of their ammunition. In preparation of the Rebel last charge of that day, Chamberlain ordered bayonets to the rifles and a counter charge down the hill at the Rebels. It was that act of courage, akin to the Charge of the Light Brigade, observed by the Rebels that sent them back down the hill never to return. Had the Rebels knew Chamberlain's troops were out of ammunition, they may had reacted differently. That Rebel charge not only cost Longstreet half of his men, he did not achieve the high ground advantage that forced an even more desperate battle strategy on Lee for the third and final day of the Battle of Gettysburg.Had Stuart and his cavalry been in Gettysburg for that second day, a flanking attack from the rear would have doomed Chamberlain long before his famous bayonet charge. Since Longstreet's charge was at the end of the Union defense, a quick victory on that portion of the whole battle field would have allowed the Confederate Army to storm right through the Union Army from the rear. Without this key advantage, the `what if' drama unfolded with the Union army digging in on both flanks forcing Lee to order on day three an attack right up the middle of the Union Army.Longstreet had grave regret for the events ordered for day and the predictable results. This gave him reason for extreme contempt for Stuart and a high degree of disdain towards General Lee. Lee had, to a fault recognized by Lee himself, a fatherly approach towards his Generals which allowed for critical failures at Gettysburg. General Ewell's failure to take Cemetery Hill when he had clear opportunity in conjunction with Stuarts failure to show up until the evening of the second day cost the Confederate Army half its troops. Together these were major contributors to the losses on day two and the eventual loss of the Battle of Gettysburg. Lee recognizing there was no one to back fill those senior ranks of General Officer was forgiving and consoling. Longstreet stressed and strained as he was the one officer with the vision to see Lee's failure. He cried visibly at the beginning of day three, sucked it up and gave the general orders for the slaughter that he knew was ensuing.If you want to look at character building and my connection to lessons learned please key word cigarroomofbooks NO!! It defined the beggining of a tottaly new era! My discovery of this piece of american history, started with my interest for films about battles, go figure, from films about II World War to films about Vietnam, so naturaly the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; caught my attention. After seeing it everything changed, and my search for more material started, until i discovered that it had been based on a book by a fellow named Michael Shaara. To my suprise discovered one of the best books i have ever read (and i have read plenty). Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, A.P. Hill, Stuart, Hancock, Armistead, Buford, among others, where brought to live before me eyes, not by the pictures of the movie, but more profoundly by the words of the author. This book taught me much about the spirit that bindes the american people, and that turned that nation into the &quot;leader&quot; of our world society. This book contains the most vivid combat descriptions, superb characterizations, fully capturing the divided lives, the heroism and the madness of this fratricidal war. NOW, STOP READING THIS AND GO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN A WONDERFULL, HISTORICAL &quot;TALE&quot; OF MEN AND THEIR BELIEVES. This novel gives you glimpses into the minds of some of the key figures in the battle of Gettysburg. It follows the chronology of the battle, day by day. Chapters are named for the characters - Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Buford, and others - and events are told from their perspectives. These are all real people who played important roles in the battle. The reader sees glimpses of the action, but not the grand scale. The maps are very helpful in seeing how the armies engaged. The author's matter-of-fact style agrees well with the topic. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads the history of the battle of Gettysburg and aches to know more. I've never considered myself a fan of historical fiction, but this is one of the best novels I've ever read. Epic in power and scope of the recreation of the leaders on both sides of the battle marking the end of the U.S's childhood as a nation, this novel is riveting and deeply moving. It does not glorify war, but marks it as something terrible we do.It does emphasize the fallacy that in light of the fluidity of technological development military strategists ever could plan for success. In a particular section, one of the leaders marvels that Jackson--yes, Stonewall Jackson, long dead before the battle of Gettysburg--could have ordered thousands of pikes to be used against musket and cannon.I don't know how accurate, it is, either, of course. It portrays Lee as an inspirational boob inspiring all who saw him while critically ignoring Longstreet's far more insightful view of tactical advantage at a terrible cost. In retrospect, of course, we know that we wouldn't have the nation we have if Lee hadn't.Still, this is a powerful work, perhaps made more powerful by our knowledge of all the bloody conflicts still to come and all the birth pangs the U.S. to this day endures. But it's a great work, a tremendous achievement, and I appreciate that it was written. If you want a good picture about what it was like to defend Little Round Top, charge across a field during Pickett's Charge, or make critical decisions concerning the outcome of mens lives and the battle; READ THIS BOOK. It neither glorifies nor denounces war but focuses on the emotions and convictions of the men that fought the Battle of Gettysburg. I could not put this book down. It tells the story of Gettysburg as well as any nonfiction book, but also delves into the human element of war and battle. The book tells the story of the battle primarily through the words and thoughts of COL Joshua Chamberlain, General Longstreet, and General Lee. If you are looking for a Civil War History starter book, this is the one. You will be hooked. Truly the best Civil War series that I have ever read is the one by the Shaaras. These guys did an awsome job. These books are well-written and well-reaserched. I have never read a more heart-felt novel about this war. The Killer Angels brings you up close and personal with these heroes. It is written in such a way that you can laugh with them, cry with them and feel the fire of the war. I am an aspiring author myself so I can recognise hard work when I see it. I have never met a Civil War fan that didn't like these books. I would recomend this book to teachers. I believe that this is a story that needs to be told. It is very good for Americans to hear what these people sacrificed for us. Michael gave us a great gift. Although a Civil War buff since junior high school, I did not discover this marvel until attending the U.S. Army Command &amp; General Staff College, where it was required reading. I was not the only student who read it in one sitting. It also caused some of the most lively discussions, debates, and arguments our class engaged in throughout the course. The most compelling thing about the book was Mr. Sharra's ability to draw one completely into the characters' thoughts and emotions. It was also a concise and riveting look at commanders' relationships with other commanders and the soldiers they would send and/or lead into battle. If you are only interested in gory battle scenes, this book is not for you. Although the battle descriptions will make you feel as if you are a participant (one can almost feel the ground trembling under the largest artillery barrage ever conducted in North America), the real story is about the individuals. It is, easily, the best historical novel I have ever read. If it doesn't make you want to run out and become a Civil War reenactor, or at least read Jeff Shaara's prequel, then you need to borrow Commander Data's emotion chip. Now, where's that hoop skirt pattern? Most times, I would much prefer to read a work of nonfiction as opposed to historical fiction. But after reading dozens of books about the Battle of Gettysburg, it was refreshing to read Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning Killer Angels. This fictional account gives us a viewpoint not to be found in nonfiction works.What makes Killer Angels different is that each chapter is written through the eyes of the various leaders from both the Union and the Confederacy including Buford, Longstreet, Lee, Chamberlain, Armistead, as well as an English observer, Fremantle. Shaara used diaries, journals, letters and memoirs to recreate not only what was happening on the battlefield, but also, what these men were thinking, seeing and feeling. It's as if you're an eyewitness to history. Killer Angels does not attempt to cover every minute of the Battle of Gettysburg. In fact, Shaara focuses on four main aspects: Buford's establishing Union lines on good ground before the battle, Longstreet's ambivalence about fighting at Gettysburg, Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine defending Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge.I found myself especially haunted by James Longstreet. Once a carefree, amiable man, he's still reeling from the recent deaths of 3 of his 4 children in one week. Robert E. Lee's number two man, he knows that a frontal attack (Pickett's charge) will be disastrous. He is tortured that Lee won't listen to his advice, and inconsolable after so many men are killed. \"Along with all the horror of loss, and the weariness, and all the sick helpless rage, there was coming now a monstrous disgust. He was through. They had all died for nothing and he sent them...The army would not recover from this day.\"I also gained an appreciation for Joshua Chamberlain. Chamberlain was not a trained soldier, but a college professor. But he was definitely a born leader. He started the Civil War as a lieutenant colonel and finished as a brigadier general. His heroics in leading his men on Little Round Top is a thing of legend, probably saved the Union and earned him a Medal of Honor.I have found that once Gettysburg has gotten under your skin, you'll never tire of reading about this important battle that changed the course of the war. For fictional accounts, Killer Angels is about as good as it gets. I've always wanted to be a writer. Now I can't, because there is no way I could ever top the emotion, insight and history of Shaara's masterpiece. Even if you aren't the least bit interested in the Civil War, reading this magnificent work of art will perhaps make you realize that the Battle of Gettysburg was the penultimate moment in this country's history. It's tragic beauty. I can't imagine anyone putting this book down... A writer this good should have had a great editor who could hold his feet to the fire and show him some matters of craft that a few of the best writers of today employ. Shame, shame, shame. I'm not a Civil War buff, preferring my military history more current, but I read Killer Angels because so many friends recommended it. Now, I'm going to read everything Michael Shaara and his son Jeff (another historic fiction novelist) have written. The author approaches the Battle of Gettysburg from the human side. He touches on causes, but only as the soldiers would experience them. One Union soldier laments that if the South wins, he will no longer be able to visit the great fishing holes he enjoys in what would become a new and separate nation if the South wins.The youthful soldiers on both sides, the battles they endure without enough food or supplies, the repercussions of a volunteer army--boys and men volunteered alongside others from their own state--makes for greater drama than any military fiction. No one was conscripted. The fear many felt because they weren't warriors, weren't trained in battle, just common people drawn into the cause of their side. Killer Angels doesn't replace the typical historic account of Gettysburg. It enhances it by adding the human layer, likely the most important in any battle. Even 150 years ago, the military taught its grunts to fight for the guy next to them in the foxhole, not some cause their government espoused.In the end, my heart was saddened for the losers, for the death of their dreams and the loss of their innocence. I never did decide which side Shaara considered to be the Killer Angels.( This book not only depics the battle of Gettysburg, but digs into the personalities of the officers on each side, their close friendships at Westpoint and theit fighting spirit on the battlefield. I didnt like the author's writing style. He could have made a brilliant adventure on every page, but gets lost in too many details rather than the overall picture of events. Still a good read, I just wasn't \"blown away\" like so many people said I would be. The Killer Angels is one of, if not the greatest and most compassionately written war books of anybody's generation. By showing both sides of the fight without showing favorites, Shaara really does show that there are no winners in war. He gets through all the myths and goes straight to the meaning of this legendary battle. Taking place in the few days before and after the Battle of Gettysburg, Shaara depicts a feeling of camaraderie and hope in both armies. The main characters, such as Peter Longstreet, Joshua Chamberlain, and Robert Lee, are beautifully developed and readers will get up close and personal with their thoughts and feelings of what is going on during their day.The South is portrayed not as slave drivers with a thirst for power, but rather as people fighting for what they believe in. As a soldier for the Confederacy put it, the war was not about slavery. Instead it is as if the South joined a club, and as easily as they were admitted, they want out, but the North will not have that.Placed through out the book is a series of maps to better the understanding of the peril of each army's stance in the war. Greatly researched, the maps provide positions of different brigades and squadrons, their general, and an estimate, shown in size, of how many soldiers are in each group. Shaara also seperaes the book into different days, starting on day 1 and ending on day 4. The first two days are spent explaining each army's predicaments and feelings of their situations. The second two are an in-depth portrayal of the losses and emotional roller coaster war can rage on soldiers.Not being an avid Civil War enthusiast, several people recommended this book to me, and it could not have been a better suggestion. This book surpasses far and beyond what a movie could in entertainment and educational value. I found myself flipping page after page as I became engrossed in Michael Shaara's interpretation of the American Civil War in, The Killer Angels. I had never been a fan of the Civil War, and picked up Mr. Shaara's book only after it was repeatedly suggested as an excellent piece of literature. This book has completely changed my view of the Civil War and my interest in historical fiction. I couldn't put it down, and finished it in two days.The book is a fast-paced account of the 4 days of battle at Gettysburg. Mr. Shaara wrote the book based as accurately as he could from the accounts of those who were there, doing so in the first person primarily through 4 of the commanding generals. It is Mr. Shaara's understanding of Confederate General Robert E. Lee that is the most impressive, he seems to do an excellent job in letting us glimpse how this now highly revered General looked at the war. Another lead character is Union Col. Joshua Chamberlain, a fascinating introduction as Chamberlain had been a professor at Bowdoin University with no military experience. His perspective on the war is vastly different from Lee's, allowing him to function as a well-written foil to Lee's perspective as a career military man. Chamberlain's unit was key to holding the Union flank and their ultimate success in this most devastating of battles.This book was so good that I have gone on to read/listen to multiple other books on the Civil War, including all of the books by Jeff Shaara, the author's son. This however, has been the clear best of the bunch. I cannot recommend the book enough, it is absolutely riveting. We had to read this book in English class, and it is INCREDIBLY boring, and hard to even read one page.I do NOT recommend this book.Please, save yourself the time. Virtually every seasoned Civil War buff has already read The Killer Angels, but there is a new generation of history readers coming along that must be made aware of this brilliant and compelling work of art. Even readers not particularly interested in military history would enjoy this wonderfully written and fact-based account of the Battle of Gettysburg, a major turning point in the war between the states.Shaara's account of Joshua Chamberlain's crucial defense of Little Roundtop and his repelling bayonet charge against a veteran Rebel force that had never tasted defeat will send chills up your spine. Red-blooded Americans north and south will cheer at the bravery, while simultaneously blanching at the folly and gore of a pitched battle.Shaara brings several things to this book. Fantastic characterizations is one. By book's end you feel as if you know and understand each major character and how and why they acted as they did. Ability to write is another. His descriptions of scene, battle, time, and emotion are top notch. The story pours out like fine wine. Shaara also breaks new ground with The Killer Angels by fictionalizing a historical event. This is a technique that will be copied many times over. His thorough research is to be commended as well. Shaara is that rare mix of good writer and historian.The only question I was left with at the end was why Lee, touted as such a military genius, would proceed with the ill-advised and ultimately tragic Pickett's Charge. I found the answer in Shelby Foote's &quot;The Civil War.&quot; Lee, abandoned by Jeb Stuart's Cavalry, over-extended in enemy territory, out-numbered, under-supplied, and under the gun, returned to the one thing that had never failed him in campaign after campaign: the bold frontal attack that always seemed to rout the Yankees. It's hard to understand Lee's motivations without getting a broader sense of his prior actions. I recommend both books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author Wake Up Dead. I'll admit it right away, I am not a fan of history-type books. I am usually bored to death by them. However, I recently read this after an eighth-grade trip to Gettysburg on the recommendation of a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised. It reads more like a good novel than a history textbook, while at the same time being very informative as to what went on. Very well written! I love reading about history whether its novelized or non-fiction. But this book was very different from all the other novels I've read. Shaara tries to encompass the whole Civil War in those 3 days. Its amazing how Shaara includes not only the battle but the whole philosophy of the entire War. I think that's the part that really moved me. He seems to depict the main characters so thoroughly that the reader seems to know each one of them as real humans not just historical characters in history books. I have never read a novelize history book with so much fiction along with history. I think 'The Killer Angels' was one of the best novels I've ever read. This was an incredible read. It imparts all of the tension, drama and romance needed to give an in depth view into the events surrounding and during Gettysburg. I've read it over and over, as well as Jeff Shaara's &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;."

         "The Man from Stone Creek",
         "I am not a big fan of anything western or cheesy romance stuff- I only had this to read one day, and I totally loved it!! I was so surprised that no one had previously reviewed this book! The story caught me from the first page, and was very hard to put back down! This book was so well written and all the characters, especially Maddie and Mr. SOB were brought to life. Humor, drama, life and death situations, this story had it all. I have to admit that I would have liked to see it end a bit differently, but for the era that the book was written in, it was appropriate! Highly Recommended!! The Man From Stone Creek is a historical western romance set in 1903 in the Arizona Territory. The main romance is filled with suspense as the hero seeks to round up cattle rustlers and train robbers. The novel achieves an emotional depth as the heroine's romance heals a past tragedy. Linda Lael Miller's romance, however, is not just a hero-heroine romance --- it is the romance of a whole town where justice is found and the downtrodden find love.Lawman Sam O'Ballivan has come to town to replace the schoolteacher. The minute he arrives, the local schoolboy fight and the boys learn justice O'Ballivan style. The boy who teased another is himself held by his feet with his head dangling down the well. The disciplined boy's complaints to his mother brings him to the attention of postmistress Maddie Chancelor. The sparks fly. When they collide, circumstances force Maddie into the sight of the most dangerous family in town. With Sam by her side, will she conquer the past or will his secret mission place her in the thick of even more trouble?Sam may be working undercover to capture the castle rustlers and thieves terrorizing the local area, but his efforts to blend just seem to lead him into more trouble. Just as he realizes Maddie has his heart, his intended bride comes in on the stagecoach. Can it get any worse? Of course! The question is can all this danger change hearts so that romance succeeds?Linda Lael Miller's magnificent romance is more than just Sam and Maddie. The reader sees problems that plagued the American West: the terrorists of the day, sickness, brothels which were often the only way for a woman to survive, children left orphaned or in need, and those left behind in the huge expansion of the West. The author does not shrink from the unpleasant realities of the historical setting, but she creates a romance where hearts are healed. Orphans and lost souls (children, adults and animals) find goodness, and justice is served. When her characters dare to opens their hearts and expose their vulnerabilities, love is found, and the lost or neglected who surround them get found. There's a new schoolmaster in Haven, Arizona, and he's making waves. While the current teacher is the bookish wimp of a man the residents of Haven expect to find doing woman's work, his replacement is something else altogether. Sam O'Ballivan may be a schoolmaster but he's not like any this town has ever seen. In fact, he's big and he's broad and he's armed and he has the women of Haven, from housewives to ladies of the evening, swooning.One woman who is immune to his sterling qualities, however, is postmistress and merchant Maddie Chancelor. Already overprotective of her younger brother, Terran, Miss Chancelor doesn't take kindly when the new schoolmaster upbraids him for a boyish but potentially harmful prank within minutes of riding into town. Maddie is determined to keep the undercover lawman at arm's length, but that proves harder and harder to do as they are repeatedly thrown together.While Sam is taking on the local children as well as working undercover to round up a local band of train robbers and rustlers, Maddie Chancelor is a complication he didn't anticipate. He may be engaged to the girl back home, but it's Maddie who fills his mind and heats his loins even as she's railing at him for his shortcomings. He can't help but be enchanted by this woman's beauty and personality even as she hides her inner tenderness under a tough exterior designed to help her provide for herself and her brother in a man's world.It doesn't take long for Sam to hone in on possible suspects for wrongdoing when he encounters the wild and wanton Donagher family. The patriarch, Mungo, is a stern and scowling man who keeps his four sons in line with fear and physical violence. Too bad he doesn't have the same effect on his hot-to-trot wife, Undine, who has developed a strong attraction to Sam.It's hard for a man to get any work done, however, when there is a constant stream of the needy dropping in on him in the schoolhouse. From little Violet Perkins who needs to be taught to bathe and could use some new clothes, to Oralee Pringle, the proprietress of the Rattlesnake Saloon and a puppy in need of a home, everyone seems to need a piece of Sam's time. Even fancy woman Bird of Paradise comes bearing food and offers of other sensual delights enough to tempt a man. Somehow though, Sam manages to stick to his business even if his mind tends to wander to more pleasurable pursuits.THE MAN FROM STONE CREEK by Linda Lael Miller is an absolutely delightful romance with plenty of action that transported me to the Old West and kept me there page after page as I got to know the endearing residents of Haven. It's a definite keeper for my bookshelf and one I'll take time to reread even when I'm tempted by the plethora of new books that constantly vie for my attention. It's one of those books that makes you wonder, long after you've read the last page, what the people you've come to know and love are doing.--- Reviewed by Amie Taylor I love Linda lael Miller. This is a good book and you will enjoy it."

         "Very helpful, photos illustrate the step by step instructions in the text. Covers my 1982 R100rs. I would recommend this manual. I bought an old BMW that needed some TLC. I didn't want to take it to the mechanic for every little issue, and this book has helped me immensely. I found the diagrams helpful and the step by step instructions to be accurate. While I'm not much of a gear-head and I admit that other books may be more thorough this does everything I need and has lots of useful information. Thanks to this book, I've done some repairs that I would've thought previously were out of my ability, and I did them well. This book is great, I tuned up my 79 R100RT in no time at all. Good illustrations, directions and tips.Iam very satisified. I find this manual just about useless. They have crammed too many models into one manual and the information is so convuluted it is almost impossible to find the information specific to your bike.I have 2 R100GS bikes and finally end up just doing the work rather than try and follow anything in this book.I will say the wiring diagram is pretty nice, but that's available for free from several sources.When I first got it I tried just to find what size the tires on my bike are and that information, along with much other useful information is not in the manual at all.I would definitely look elsewhere if you have an airhead BMW. I needed a good book to detail the pieces of the R100GS fairing and control cluster, so I could re-assemble a bike that had been badly \"customized\" This manual had the diagrams, the pictures, and the wiring information I needed. Good history on the different BMW models in the preface as well."

         "I enjoyed this book. I am now reading the rest of the series and I have not been disappointed. You fall in love with the characters, the story and Richards drive to save the people he loves. Just awesome, a recommended read!!!! It's been a while since I've read this book, perhaps a few years back, actuually, but I do remember why I got it. Imagine this:I'm in a book store with a limited amount of money, maybe enough for two paperbacks. Wanting to get my money's worth and passed over smaller (but much better) books to try out this monster of a novel, what a great deal! I figured that even after I finish this one, Mr. Goodkind has other books in the series to keep me interested for a good long time. I soon realized that I should've listened once again to the age-old morals I've been taught as a child but never listened to.Quality, not quantity.To give the author proper due, he does describe everything in full and rich detail, painting a picture of the scene before you. Unfortunately, my praise has to stop there. Every character within the story happens to be a flat, one-dimensional stereotypical person, with changes in personality that doesn't make any type of sense. As another reviewer mentioned, a lot of focus was placed on 'friends' and what they do for each other. Oh oh, I'm getting queasy just remembering this. It was very painful to read, but I spent money on it so I will damn well read the whole thing even if it made me physically ill. The only thing that made it tolerable and maybe even a bit more enjoyable was imagining the whole book as an anime (and I do love anime :) ).. then all the melodrama and posturing made more sense, not to mention all the kinky S&amp;M + over the top torture. The only redeeming thing about this novel is that it is a fairly enclosed book (ie. doesn't end with a cliffhanger) so I wouldn't be forced to read another just to finish the 'story'.I did finish the book, however, and it is now with a friend somewhere on the other side of the continent with the hope that she reads a bit of it and tell me if it is really that bad or that I am just nuts. I think it is rightfully still gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. I loved this book! The action and story line was non-stop...It was hard to ever put the book down. No non-essential details or rambling story lines it was all stuff i wanted to know. Enjoy! I only hope the other 10 in the series are the same. This book started slow and I almost didn't finish it. Don't make this mistake. It picks up in the middle and then it never slows down. It is a very good read.In Wizard's First Rule, we are introduce to Richard, a ranger. His father was recently murdered, and it was gruesome. While off the in the forest, he encounters a beautiful women fleeing for her life. Is there a connection?From these earlier scenes, we encounter Wizards, Witches, Friendly Spirits and Deadly Ghosts. There are also talking dragons and flying, fierce winged warrior beasts.The whole world may be destroyed, if Richard makes the wrong choice. The writer has a good sense of style, and good sense of humor, and an interesting sense of morality. At one point a Wizard says that he did the worst thing possible, he let the people suffer from the consequences of their actions. Of all this is an excellent book and I think most fantasy lovers will enjoy it. A good start in a great series. I read a lot of highly technical material for work so I admit I don't read as much for pleasure as many others. I prefer fantasy/sci-fi; Tolkien and Frank Herbert are obvious choices as favorites for deeper reading, and I admit I'm partial to McCaffrey's Pern books and Ray Feist when I want something light. Feist is the kind of writer who makes me think writing a fantasy novel would be fun and easy; just write up an old D&D; campaign! (I realize it's not actually that simple and I certainly don't have time to pursue it myself, but that's how Feist makes me feel when I read him.)I wanted something vaguely along those lines. I had heard of Goodkind and picked up _Phantom_ at Target right before heading off, not realizing it's the 11th book in the series. When I realized the series was called the \"Sword of Truth\" series, an alarm went off in my head (I need to learn to listen to those). But I found a bookstore on the trip and bought the first book, _Wizards First Rule_.Ugh. I found this to be hopelessly hackneyed and depressingly derivative. (Warning: I haven't even read Jordan's WoT series and I *still* thought this was derivative.) I think \"leave no cliche unturned\" must have been Goodkind's motto when writing this. Other 1-star reviews here are spot-on with this; this novel is almost a parody of the fantasy/sci-fi genre. (Actually, it probably would have been better as a parody.)I almost gave up on it numerous time but I hung in there to find out what a Confessor was and I really hope that was Goodkind's idea, because it was the only standout concept in the entire book. At that point the book was more than half over and I plowed on figuring I got that far, might as well finish.The major \"departure\" from the cliche-fest is Goodkind's agenda of inserting political philosophy. I found this almost comically ham-handed. You see, the bad guys are Commies! Yep, complete with the \"People's Palace.\" I actually laughed out loud at the \"trial\" of the farmer by the evil queen (whose name I forget; surprisingly, it isn't \"Queen Mao\"). Message to all you fantasy fans who think this is deep and philosophical because he included this: no, it really isn't. Not a single idea expressed is novel and his descriptions of the positions are simplistic caricatures.And the 100-page excursion into S&M; was simply juvenile and served almost exactly no purpose. I'm sure I would have loved it when I was 13; I thought McCaffrey's _Dragonflight_ was pretty racy back then.And I fail to see what's so compelling about the characters that all these five-star reviews get on about. What's interesting about Richard? He's freaking superman: big, strong, slightly clueless (except when it's REALLY important to get out of some contrived jam), but flawless woodsman, horse rider, archer, swordsman, wannabe wizard, etc. Yawn. I was shocked that he didn't turn water into wine at some point in the book. While some of the other characters were indeed better, the problem is that the worst character happened to be the main protagonist and most of the pages were devoted to him.One of the finer moments which almost caused me to put the book down was the name of the villain: Darken. Seriously, Darken. You know, as in \"dark.\" Remember, kids, black = evil! I was similarly shocked when Goodkind didn't have him wear a black cowboy hat. I know, that's a really stupid surface feature and doesn't get to the heart of whether the writing or the story or the characters are good. But look at it this way: if the easy stuff is that blunt, how well do you think he did with the important stuff?And for the love of all that is holy, who was Goodkind's editor? 800 pages? For this? I want that editor's job. \"Sure, Terry, just leave it all in there... yeah, I gotta run, I have an afternoon tee time...\" How about EDITING?Now, to be honest, I didn't hate every minute of it. Honestly, when I finished this book and thought about how I felt about it, I was thinking 1.5 stars. Seeing that the average is four, though, I had to give it one rather than two to drop the average. There is NO WAY this is a four-star book. None. I can see how maybe someone with somewhat different tastes could give it a three, but four seems like a serious reach and five is IMPOSSIBLE. _Dune_ is a five-star book. _Lord of the Rings_ are five-star books. I'm very, very afraid to see that some people think this belongs in the same category. Very afraid indeed. Anxious to see of Book #2 is as good as the first one. Hoping this series does not evolve into a soap opera. Terry Goodkind is simply awe-inspiring. His prose is the best I've encountered in a long while. This is a must read! This book was a bit too much of the typical fantasy novel with the all powerful bad guy and the band of merry men who have to find a way to stop him. Despite it's 800 or so pages, I finished it very quickly, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was so simple that I didn't have to think about what I was reading. That isn't too say it didn't have any redeeming qualities. It was entertaining enough for me to want to finish it, but was definately along the lines of easy summer reading. I am not usually read fantasy books. But somehow I picked up this one. The first chapter was difficult going but after that I was enthralled in the world that Goodkind created. The wizards, the confessors, the sword of truth...I read the whole book in one night. Though the major theme, good vs. evil, is not original or complex, it is the characters and the magnificent creatures and settings that makes this book so spellbinding. This was recommended by many family members, and when I finally read it, it was entertaining and enjoyable! Great fantasy. Maybe I've been forever spoiled by Tolkien. Maybe I'm setting the bar too high because I expect my heroes to be heroic in the old sense of the word (like the heroes of Icelanding and northern mythology that he drew from) and my characters, especially the dragons, to possess certain characteristics that don't make them seem like people from the 1990's. Maybe I expect a world rich in magic and culture and worth saving, and maybe I like villains who I can feel are evil without their having to torture children or ravish women in explicit detail. It's possible, I suppose, that these and other factors make it impossible for me to really enjoy a fantasy novel like this one.This book is not without its merits. Some of the minor characters are very interesting, and there are times when the narrative is gripping. But overall this novel fell very short for me for a number of reasons. The main characters are at times very interesting, at times dull and boring. The hero, Richard, is a fairly flat character, always doing the right thing and unfailing in his devotion to the woman he loves. At times he is brilliant and insightful-at times he lets the most obvious detail rush past him without even considering it. Much of the trouble he gets in comes from completely missing something obvious, most of the trouble he gets himself out of comes from an astute observation that puts him in possession of some knowledge you'd swear he couldn't have gotten on his own.Kahlan, the heroine, could be a great character if it weren't for her girl next door qualities that make it difficult to really believe in her. Most of the other main characters share some of these qualities-you want to like them, but you just can't quite bring yourself to do it. For the most part the dialog is corny and the plot glaringly predictable. The author's attempts at plot twists usually stem out of \"this is impossible-there's no way it can be done\" followed by a character finding a way it can, in fact, be done.So why give it a decent rating? Quite simply put I don't feel that the time I took to read the book was wasted. The book is an entertaining read, and some of the adventures our heroes find themselves in are done well. I did find myself reading large parts of the book at a time-something I don't do when I'm struggling to finish a book. Still, there just isn't enough here to call it good fantasy. The constant hopeless situations the characters find themselves in are tedious-you won't believe how many brushes with death two people can have in the course of a day or a week. Still, Goodkind does a decent job of moving the plot along (even though, as I said, it is incredibly predictable) and has a talent for detail and descriptions, especially of scenery. One redeeming quality of the book is one reason I won't be reading the rest of them-the characters, especially Kahlan, show many sides throughout the book and vary from weakness to an inner strength that ultimately rounds them out nicely. That said, having seen the full spectrum of Kahlan's character in this book makes me feel there's nothing else she can offer to the plot of the next books.In conclusion, if you're a fantasy diehard this book (and who knows, maybe the series) are worth a look. I didn't particularly enjoy the book but didn't put it down either, so I guess it was worth one read. Just one though-no finishing of the series for me. Wow lots of bad or lackluster reviews.I picked up these books long ago because they 1) were fat, and 2) looked interesting. I love long complex stories that have time to really explore people/charactors and these books did not let me down.Maybe the way Terry teaches moral lessons through the events of his charactors as he tells this amazing story are too much for some folks.I have just reread the first 5 books in this series for the 3rd time I'm still amazed at the strong emotions he can invoke. From joy, to humor, to sadness Terry uses his story to entertain and to teach. Richard may be the main char in the book but Khalan comes in a close second. A stronger woman is hard to find and between them they present great role models for everyone.Each book reveals a new Wizards rule which is staring each of us in the face everyday if only we cared to see it. To spoil the first rule: People will believe what they want to believe. Just look around and you can see how true this is. Facts seem to have no bearing on what people believe.Enjoy the story and watch as Terry explains our real world as he entertains you. I had read all of Jordan's books and liked them. I had read most of Mercades Lackay's books after picking up Winds of Fate off the shelf at random. I was so board because I could not find anything that kept me reading for more than 5 pages. Then I saw Wizard's First Rule on the shelf and decided to try it. That was close the best decision of my life. I read it in 3 days, because it was so inthralling. It has the usual fantasy ingrediants, romance, magic, different kingdoms in conflict. But it also had suprises waiting in every page. I loved it. Kahlan and Moiraine (of Jordan's Wheel of Time) have become my heroines, and I adored Rachel. Most people reveiwing Goodkind say it resembles Jordan's work. I think that Terry Goodkind has made a better first book than Jordan's Eye of the World, which I love and own. Wizard's First Rule is much more inthralling at the start and drws you in more than the Eye of the World. I, personally, love it. I rate it 6 out of 5 stars if I could. Oh, did I mention, I read it over 3 times after I finished it? Of late, I get skeptical with multiple volume sagas, but Wizard's First Rule (WFR) has a lot going for it. First of all, the characters are unpretentiously realistic. Throughout the book, despite their respective gifts, the protagonists retain their essential human traits of jealously and insecurity, refreshing counterpoints to their undoubted merits. These are no infallible superbeings, thank God. The downside to their abilities too is spelled out clearly as Terry Goodkind (TG) brings out the cost to them of exercising their powers. For that matter, the villain, wicked as he is, is not pure unalloyed evil either. Clearly, TG deals in many shades of grey, and not pure black and white. Secondly, TG has introduced some interestingly novel concepts like the magic of the Confessors, the Mord-Sith. A number of reviews have protested the graphic violence and sexual assault depicted but I must disagree. Yes, the depictions are gory and make your stomach twist, but their integrity to the story line is beyond question. It is only as you continue past the first volume that you realize how important to the saga these harsh scenes are. For all that, there are flaws aplenty. Some of TG's concepts are almost insultingly silly like classifying magic as Additive and Subtractive (I suppose he was trying to avoid the hackneyed white vs. black or good vs. evil, but this is a pathetic substitute) or short tailed gars being smart because they count their blood flies (Puhleeze!). Also the absence of a prologue is unsettling and the quality of the maps is terrible. Why do fantasy authors never realize that a reader needs maps to picture a new world? Figuring the geographic location of the characters from the maps provided is a task for the very gifted indeed. First time readers would do well to first read \"Debt of Bones\", a short story by TG, set prior to the events of WFR, (which can be found in \"Legends : Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy\" edited by Robert Silverberg) as this provides some context for the saga. All in all, a very good beginning and a must for fantasy fans. Be warned, this book is insidiously hypnotic. Once you start reading, you will find it very difficult to stop! A good read with lots of action. Our hero Richard Cypher gets into one tight spot after another and amazingly escapes. Great book for both young and old. I am looking forward to next book in the series. First Introduce to me by my husband. Now I can't help myself to his next book.. It is great story, which have lot of plot, medival background plus magical and fantasy in throw into the plot too. Great BOok. Thrilling, but could have been a lot better if ...1. Some elements would have received more thought. Take the \"boundary\" for example. As was mentioned in a review before the \"boundary\" makes little sense the way it is presented. The differences between the two worlds separated only about 20 years ago are not reasonable. The \"boundary\" should have been there for a few hundred years at least to make sense in the context of the story. Another example, the space of the world the story takes place seems to bee stupidly small. It makes you fell like you can travel from one corner of the world to the other in a matter of days.2. The \"speed\" of the story would have been more constant. What I mean is that sometimes the story \"rushes\" trough the events making your head spin around when a lot of significant things happen very fast, while others times the story just \"camps\" making you want to skip a few pages. Not a good writing technique. The same with details. Sometimes the author exposes every tiny detail as if he wants everyone to get a very detailed picture of what is happening while other times he reveals very few details leting the reader's imagination to complete the picture. Decide! it should be either the first or the second approach.3. The story takes places in an fantasy world inspired mostly from medieval Europe (like most fantasy novels). However (some of )the characters way of thinking (psychology?) seams to belong in our modern western culture. Emphases of modern (politically correct)themes like pedophilia, rape or equality between sexes are unnatural to the story \"medieval\" atmosphere as are some of the characters dilemmas.4. Last, as in too many fantasy stories the characters (both good and bad) are sometimes ludicrously overconfident. Their success is based too much on good luck. I think it wouldn't hurt to make them more realistic. This book was a true masterpeice, Richard Cypher comes from a land of no magic and is thrust into a ferocious battle with an unimaginable evil: Darken Rahl. The only weapon he has is the magical Sword Of Truth that his wizard friend gives to him. His companions are Zedd and the Mother Confesser: Kahlan Amnell. Richard follows Kahlan blindly into the midlands to fight Darken Rahl. This book was excellent and anybody who critizes it is out of their mind. By pure chance i got this book of the shelf of a librarby in a pick-and-choose mood. Oh dear. Having just finished the Robyn Hobb Liveship seeries I looked for another series to start reading. This time I wanted to go with something that was largely published so I didn't have to wait between installments. Now I won't have to. This book and the second in the series were complete shockers.Save your money.Rob Now, this review is coming from a self-proclaimed fantasy snob. I don't read fantasy-- except for Tolkien... but for some reason I decided to start this series.Imagine my surprise when I really enjoyed the book. It has fast-paced action, characters that I liked and hated, and by the end, I'll admit, I had a itsy-bitsy crush on Richard.I didn't notice any major issues with the story line or language... there were a few editing issues that I caught, but despite the elements that are undoubtedly similar to Star Wars and LOTR... it was still an interesting, well-written easy to read and enjoy thrill ride.It is very adult in places, so I don't recommend this to children, not even young teenagers.All in all, good read! I didn't expect to like this book. My husband got me to read it, and I'm glad he did. It is inventive, lushly descriptive, and the characters are wonderful. It's a beautiful novel. It has incredible intracicies. The story twists and turns. Goodkind is a master of description, drawing the reader into this fantastic world. When you learn what the Wizard's First Rule is, you'll be surprised. In many ways, it's a story of romance and Goodkind's interesting, individualistic philosophy of the world. It's truly a great story, one of the best I've ever read. The joy of this book is in that the concepts put forth by the author are simple, direct, and therefore all the more powerful for it. The best ideas are those that are clean and easy to understand, and Wizard's First Rule manages to incorporate several of these philosophies into a story that is not only entertaining, but involves characters whose motivations, while not high-minded or full of \"deep\" meaning, are -real-. I love this book! I could not put it down. The characters are awesome, Zed is my favorite. Everybody that has borrowed it from me are hooked on the series now. This book is a great read and very original material. I love the creative different classes of characters. There is great drama between the characters and a very good story line. I highly recommend for anyone that loves fantasy. My step-dad, Ashley, told me to read this book. Even though he only read half, I trust his judgment. I mean, he got me into Dragonlance! I doubted a little when I read reviews of this book, saying it was \"bland and conventional\", had \"bad dialog and prose\" and is \"overwritten, hackneyed and lengthy.\" My guess is that these reviewers didnt actually finnish the book. Yes, there were very obvious and over used fantasy cliches, like the innocent farm boy-turns hero, old mentor for life is actually very powerful wizard, and maiden saved in first chapter is love intrest through the whole story. But Terry Goodkind is able to take this basic stuff and turn it into something wonderful. AND, for those who call it unoriginal, I'd like to point out that there was not one elf or dwarf. Plus, theres an evil villian you just love to loath, and the Mord-Sith completly took me off guard. Also, the main charector's name: Richard. So simple, so common, so easy to pronounce. I think it adds to the rawness of the story. This book is wonderfuly detailed, and the shocker at the end is so painfuly obvious that it makes you deliciously surprised, flabergasted, and left wanting for more. Personaly, I found the \"love conflict\" resolved to quickly, and it was a bit cheesy. And at times, I thought I could have written the dialouge better. BUT, the book was amazing. For a first book, Goodkind definetly outdid himself. I just finished &quot;Wizards First Rule&quot; (Okay I thought the way Goodkind worked the title into the story was nicely done) and for the most part I was rather disappointed by the book. While I found the book to move along quickly, I also found it to be very predictable. I found the way Goodkind repeatedly had his characters ignore ALL the clues and just happily muck things up (but always recover effortlessly) rather insulting. I will not compare this book to any other, I believe that to be unfair to the ART in a book. I will say that, with the exception of the torture pages, this would have made a wonderful read for older children and young adults.In summary: This book, because of the torture and sado-erotic portion is not recommended for young readers. Further, because of the simple plot twists and writing style, this book may be too juvenile for many adult readers. However, if you simply must have something to read for that flight from NY to LA (why I grabbed it) or just want to be entertained without needing to think too much this is not a bad book. I totally enjoyed the book. A very good read with a love story as an added sub story. If you enjoyed the Inheritance series then you will enjoy this one. I read this once before, 7 or 8 years ago. But after reading Goodkind's newest, The Legend of Magna Searus, I knew I needed/wanted to read it again. This book was even better, now that some things had been explained. I highly recommend both books! This is a dark and graphic book. And I don't mean just in a blood and guts way but in a really evil, sick way. Horrendous evils are described. What are some of the worst things you can imagine happening to someone (even a child)? It's in there. The author has an extremely sick imagination. I was really disturbed by this book. A friend of mine recommended it to me and knowing her, I'm shocked that SHE likes it. I love fantasy and this is like no fantasy I've ever read. There are some moving/touching moments in the book, but it's not worth all the horror. But, if you're into 'horror fantasy' then you might like it.The writing is not that great. The adult characters often make elementary grammar mistakes which make them sound like 3 year olds. And they repeat their gestures a lot, such as 'small smiles', 'quiet smiles,' holding each other's chins, looking at each other from 'under their eyebrows' etc. But despite the writing fallacies (it's his first novel after all), I would have enjoyed the story if it were not for all the unnecessary disturbing descriptions.Unless you enjoy reading about dark and terrible acts of cruelty and disgusting things being done to people, avoid this book. Wonderful story. You will fall in love with the characters. Good service too. This book is one of my favourites, firstly it does not do the whole \"lets copy tolkien and capitalise on it\" and is quite original in its world making. As far as i can remember there are no orcs or elves in this book which already is a bonus to being original in creature creation. A very original story that grips you and leaves you breathless for more (refer to the mord-sith ordeal). Terry has a nice fluid style of writing and thats important as it makes the story feel smoother and it flows easier. Standard fantasy plot: good vs. evil, world hangs in balance, unlikely hero. The badness starts with Richard, the protagonist. \"A rare person,\" other characters annoyingly remind us. What they mean is that he unwaveringly does the right thing. A fine trait in a human. A bad trait in a character. It makes him seem flat. It also devalues his struggles, because the only thing that can save such a stubborn protagonist from such a dangerous world is screwball world logic. At the same time, Goodkind strives for horrific villains and situations, but combined with the shallow characters and cartoonish twists, it just feels distasteful and off, like the Muppets doing a torture documentary.Even when it's not grim, the story's pretty cheesy. For example, what does god-of-evil antagonist Darken Rahl do when he captures Richard? He leaves Richard with a leather-clad dominatrix who tortures him by biting his lower lip and zapping him with a magical riding crop. Um... with enemies like these, couldn't all of us be unwavering? I've squandered many paychecks on the very same treatment, but supposedly it's a fate worse than death. Granted, the scene gave me a week's worth of masturbation fodder, but couldn't Goodkind give his reader something to spank off to without tanking the credibility of his whole plot?Another eye-roller: Demmin Nass is Rahl's right-hand-man, built up as a total badass. He finally appears late in the book, capturing Kahlan, the female lead. Pretty intense... until Goodkind tells us Kahlan can turn Incredible Hulk, which she does, then dismembers Nass in about half a sentence. Imagine if late in Fellowship, Frodo casually tore a Nazgul limb from limb, Tolkien explaining, \"I forgot to mention, Frodo's a beast when he's angry.\" Wouldn't that suck? It does here, too. Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is definitely the best fantasy series I've ever come across. The prose is excellent, everything is described in just enough detail so that the reader can adequately visualize the scenario, but not too much so as to bog down the significance of whatever is occurring with meaningless details. All of the characters are interesting and easy to \"get into\". The main character, Richard, could have easily fallen into the fantasy trap of bland and boring main character with no background suddenly having to save the world (think Rand from Wheel of Time or Shea from the Shannara series). Thankfully, Richard actually interests the reader! He has his own way of thinking and motivations that differentiate him from the other characters and actually highlight why he is able to lead everyone else, instead of just being \"the chosen one\" or whatever. The other major characters in the first chapter of this epic saga are Zedd, a former wizard, and Kahlan, the Mother Confessor of the midlands, which is not only a title of rank, but also sort of a \"character class\" (if you want to look at it from a gaming perspective) as the Confessors have a special ability which is wholely unique, and put to good use throughout the whole series. Although there are several major enemies lurking in the background that aren't wholly revealed until later books, the main baddy here is one Darken Rahl, an insane wizard of considerable power. Like Richard, Darken Rahl is in no way a boring or cardboard cut-out type character. The reader is given more details regarding Darken all the way through the series. Darken has a strange kind of insanity that makes complete sense to himself. It only seems natural to him that, being a being of great power like himself, he should have complete ownership of everything and everyone.This entire series is based on the philosophy of Objectivism by Ayn Rand. To better understand this series, I recommend reading \"For the New Intellectual\" by Ayn Rand. You will better understand the archetypes and themes Goodkind is shooting for when brother Narev and Emporer Jagang are introduced a little bit later in the series (the priest and the barbarian - the two components necessary to subjugate a society). Of course, if you wanted to take the idea further and extend it into reality, you could apply this same archetype to several prominent members of American government. Whether intentional or not, Goodkind's writing makes you think about more than swords and dragons.So far, every book in this series has managed to make me tear up a little, if not outright cry. You really start to lose yourself in the characters after a while. Towards the end, when Kahlan discovers that Richard is being held captive and tortured daily by a Mord-Sith, and it appears that all is lost and the whole group will be killed by Demmin Nas (Oh Demmin - the best fantasy villain of all time. I sincerely wish he hadn't been killed off as early as he was. Goodkind had the balls to actually present a villain that we truly reviled), Kahlan's primal scream of agony and anguish (combined with her shocking revelation of the magic of Kon Dar) were described in such perfect detail that I felt as though I was there. I could feel the horror and anguish within Kahlan slowly change to a simmering anger, which built to a full flung righteous wrath, demanding nothing less than the blood of Demmin Nas. The writing is done so well here that the reader can almost see the magic of Kon Dar explode out from Kahlan, swaying the trees and sending the pine needles flying, and then everything just stops for a dreadful moment when you realize something crazy intense is about to occur, and it does. What occurs next is highly reminiscent of the climax of the film \"28 Days Later\", when the main character becomes the physical embodiment of absolute rage, pulling out all the stops and absolutely destroying anything that comes between himself and his goal - which is the same in both the book and the film - to save the character's loved ones from certian doom.I was very suprised to read the other reviews of this book and discover that many people were supremely offended when they realized that this book had realistic depictions of battle, death, and even *gasp* torture! You guys seem to have stumbled into the wrong section of the library. You were supposed to go under that big archway over there - you know, the one with the little plastic river under it and styrofoam unicorns and a big, colorful sign that says \"Kids Section\". Yes everyone, there is in fact grown up material in this novel! Unbeliavable, isn't it? I find it strange that the more adult material in this book was specifically targeted by people as \"perverse and unnecessary\" as it seemed to me to be the exact opposite of that. The depictions of torture in this book, besides working on their own as a legitimate literary device to emotionally impact the reader, does in fact serve a greater purpose. The segment of the book where Richard is being held and tortured by the Mord-Sith gives us a deeper look into the character that is Richard - we begin to see who he really is under pressure and what he will develop into later on in the series when similar circumstances befall him again.I could go on for pages more about how great this series is. Pick this book up and find out for yourself. Mildly engrossing at times, but the plot is pure soap opera. Not an uncommon problem in the fantsay genre, but each plot &quot;twist&quot; is apparent about 150 pages before hand. I struggled to reach the end and will not be finishing the series. I first read this book as a young teenager in 1994. And I loved every page of it. I thought it was the best fantasy book ever written. I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars, because I still cherish that experience.Decades have passed since then, and I find my tastes have changed. WFR is still a fast-moving story with some fresh ideas, but when I read it now, I find the storytelling to be lazy and indulgent.It's still worth reading. Just have the right expectations. Expect to have fun, not have your world view altered. Listen people, any one who gives the SoT series a bad rap needs to learn ONE THING. Terry Goodkind Is a Lawyer Not some Language Professor who spent his whole Life in The library Like warren in the palace of the prophets. So would you people BACK OFF!!! And another thing most of you are saying that he copies Robert Jorden's charecters and plots. Yet you Dont give an Example of what he ripped off... I have to say, I've never been so into a book series that I literally read until I fall asleep, and have to find my place in the book when I wake up in the morning! This was a wonderful book, and the ones to follow just get better! Of course there are some cliche parts, but it was still fantastic! Terry Goodkind is one of the GREAT fantasy authors. If you're looking for a truly captivating story with vivid scene setting,fully developed characters, and a presentation that makes putting it down a serious challenge, then start here for the fantasy adventure of a lifetime. You'll want to continue through all eight books in the series. I decided to give this series a try. In the Netherlands the amount of Fantasy series is less then in some other countries, and this is one of the series that is in nearly every bookstore. So it probably sells decently. Now that unfortunately is not a measure of quality.What i did not like about this book! I am about 50 pages from the end, but decided to give my review anyway. For all i disliked its simplicity. There is one storyline. And only one! It all circles about our hero Richard. (Some very small diversions to other characters but those can be neglected) And some of the things that happen are very coincidental, like the finding of a certain magical object. A bit too coincidental in my opinion! Futhermore the author drags on some scenes until the point where i got the feeling &quot;Ok&eacute;, now we got the idea&quot;, like the whole Denna-thing. The whole concept/plot is rather cliche.But on the other hand. It is a fairly easy read. And i have seen worse. I'm not sure whether i will read on in the series. Maybe if the library has them, and i'm out of other thing to read. Loved this book, its fairly long, which is good it gives you time to get to know the characters. Its the classic good vs. evil story. Wizard's First Rule is a well put together story that will keep you flipping pages to get to the next chapter. I finished this book then moved on to Stone of Tears and am now reading Blood of the Fold. Each book contains themes that will be answered as the books unfold, but each book is complete with a satisfying ending and won't leave you hanging until the next book. I don't know how he does it but these books will make you want to spend more time outdoors instead of sitting in front of the TV. Also, Truth, Honor, and Loyalty and the ability to make hard decisions is a major focal point of these books. So if these things still matter to you, hop on board for a thrilling ride. Ignore the critics, they are never happy with anything, and read this book for yourself. You may just find yourself looking forward to the next. I received this from my son and although it took a few chapters to capture me, it certainly captured me well when it did. A great story with some unique character types within the framework of the often-seen. A book unafraid to show a hero AND a heroine as equally important to the story line and without the common \"Me da man, me musclebound\" type hero stuff normally encountered. Richard is every inch as desirable as a hero should be without the chest-beating or mind-warping melodrama often assigned to heroes. I quite enjoyed this book. Can't find too many clear-headed opinions on Terry Goodkind, or so it seems.Mr Goodkind is not the greatest author going, despite what the gushers say. His writing skills do need work. He doesn't paint pictures very well, except for the S&M; parts, which he describes rather too well. He does do his characters well, though, which is why I like the book.I'm pretty sure he writes fantasy to get his philosophical views across, though they aren't overbearing in this book.Mr Goodkind is not the worst writer on the planet, either, despite what the screamers say.It's a simple story about woods guide (Richard) who finds a woman (Kahlan) in the forest and begins an adventure. He visits new lands, meets interesting people and gains new responsibilities. There aren't any huge plot twists and not much suspense either, but for this story that is just fine. It's a pleasant, light read. If you're looking for the next Tolkien, you'll be disappointed (and angry, judging by some of the other reviews).The only major problem I had with this particular book is with the torture/S&M; that seems to go on for quite a long time. So if you're a responsible parent, your 12 year old SHOULD NOT BE READING THIS BOOK.Overall, I like this book a lot. I liked the way he did his characters and that made up for the not-so-good descriptions of places. One other nice thing is that while this is part of a long series, this book can stand alone on it's own. It's the best book in the series. On the surface this was a very simple and cliched fantasy novel, until the final couple hundred pages when Mistress Denna was introduced. At that point the work became more mature and sophisticated which I appreciate. What was most interesting about the novel wasn't the story, but the powerful questions it raised and the ongoing political dialogue.I feel the best books are books that force readers to ask questions about themselves and the world around them, and Wizard's First Rule succeeds at doing so. The first rule, which states \"people are stupid, they believe what they want to believe,\" forces readers to think about their own beliefs and values, and if the readers adhere to those values or belief systems because they have the facts to prove them, or if they believe them because they want to think they are true.Terry Goodkind's website indicates that The Sword of Truth series was written to express Goodkind's objectivist views, and is linked to the Ayn Rand Institute. Goodkind's website has an objectivist forum, where fans of the series discuss the virtues of libertarian capitalism, which is at the core of objectivist philosophy. Whether Goodkind intended this or not, Wizard's First Rule actually promotes Noam Chomsky's libertarian socialist views. For example the Queen of Tamarang is symbolic of what happens when societies adopt Rand's politics of libertarian capitialism, which is the politcs of nearly all Third World countries, where there is a seperation between government and economics. Whenever workers, in this case the peasants of the Midlands, lose their collective bargaining power, a few individuals seize control of most of the property and you are left with a rule by the rich, as was the case with the Queen and her rich pals in their relations with the poor farmers. Violet's lust for beheading peasants is symbolic of the objectivist absense of altruism. When people care only about maximizing profits, as objectivists argue they should, they don't care about the welfare of the poor. Trying to maximize profits and protect human rights is a contradiction that can't exist. Here in America shareholders can sue corporations for trying to be altruistic because it interferes with the shareholders moral and legal rights of making the most money possible. If Goodkind wanted to promote objectivism, then why are all the villians Randian?Richard and Kahlan are liberals. Richard doesn't want to be on the quest, but does so anyway because of altruism which Rand despises. Objectivists would blast Kahlan for being a socialist as she uses her govermental power to redistribute wealth and power, giving the poor workers more opportunities. In every instance of Wizard's First Rule, where governmental corruption takes place, the focus is pointing out the negative attributes of hierarchical power that libertarian socialists see as being in the way of human rights. Throughout the novel readers are given examples of where the rich have power and the poor don't, and human rights abuses are commited, which is the end result of the implementation of Randian politics.It's worth pointing out that in this post 9/11 world, no adult will be able to read Wizard's First Rule without comparing Darken Rahl to George W. Bush, and the People's Party to the Republican Party. Like Darken, Bush is a charismatic and charming figure that people want to put their trust in, just like the people from the Midlands and D'Hara, but Rahl's Randian persuit of self interest ends up destroying the lives of many of his own people, and also the people he invades (parallels to U.S. and Iraq abound).I really enjoyed this book as a work of philosophy, and the story made the philosophy much more readable than standard philosophical treatises. WOW! Even though I'm only eleven and it took me a full nine days to read this (Well, technically ten, I had to stay up past twelve o'clock on the last night to finish it) I think it's great. Of course it's not written for kids my age and all, but I think it rocks. I concurr with other people: I was glad that this book is what it is beacause I finish books faster than I can buy them or check them out of the library and it becoames *AGGRAVATING*. I highly reccomemnd this book...but a warning: it has a few &quot;bad&quot; things in it. It's worth it, though...I would say. Read this if you like fantasy...or even if you don't! Is Terry Goodkind a man or a woman? I also must praise Zedd...he's extremely FUNNY! Well, maybe not extremely, but I liked him a good deal. Read this book! Normally I despise fantasy books with the exception of Tolken's Lord of the Rings. A friend of mine recommended this book and I have to say it was excellent. I could not put it down. The characters were well developed though I have to say in the end there was one scene where my only reaction was \"WHAT?\" Goodkind is a good writer but there are some scenes in this text that one can do without, ie the scenes with the Deanna, the Mord-Sith, were prolonged and slightly too involved and explicit for my tastes. With the exceptions of these scenes, the overall writing style was great. The story was well developed and a good prelude to the rest of the series. I would highly recommend reading this book though the length is somewhere in the 800 or so pages. Wizards First Rule was a horrible mess of a book. There was absolutely no charactur development, and I could really care less what hapened to them. Dont start this series because they are all aweful. Read books by J.R.R Tolkien, George R.R.Martin because those are much better written then The Sword of Truth series. I started with tv series n am now on too the books n I'm hooked way better than the show I hated in the show that Richard n kaylan were kept apart can't wait too see how it work out with them together on to the next book love it love it love it yipeeeee This book is the beginning to what has to be one of the greatest series ever written. I personally loved this book but it's only a start and the farther in the series you get the better it becomes. Goodkind questions, pokes and prods at modern society giving praise to individuality and original ways of thinking. If you've read any Robert Jordan and liked it you'll love Terry Goodkind because the two series are easily comparable and both are amazing. I have a very literate friend that always berated sci-fi fantasy books as trash literature. Until I read this book I never really quite understood what it was that she saw in them that she found so offensive. This book is quite literally trash. Characters constantly burst into cliched conversations about love and friendship, and they continuously act and react in ways that fit the plot but are totally out of character and or without sufficient motivation. The writing is horrendous. Never have I cringed so much at poor writing than I did when I read this book. I know of course that it must take a lot of talent to be able to fill 800+ pages, but still the writing stinks.With that said, this is however actually a pretty interesting book. It starts off incredibly slow; I think that Goodkind must have assumed that readers would be so immediately enchanted by his main characters that they wouldn't notice the lack of plot in the first half of the book. It does, however, really start to pick up the pace towards the middle of the book, and by the end you won't be able to put it down. The story is typical fantasy; a back woods guy has a chance meeting with a mysterious woman that results in a series of events that will determine the fate of the world. Nothing really new here. If you can get over the aforementioned cliched dialogue and completely unmotivated actions, the characters are pretty interesting and likeable.I have read a couple of the books that follow in this series and while they suffer from the same aforementioned problems they are more interesting than this first novel and thus make reading the series worthwhile. All in all, I would have to say that if you are interested in reading a long series, and don't really care if your brain will turn into mush, then the Sword of Truth novels are not a bad choice. I would however recommend Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" series instead. The good things about this book are Goodkind's crafty use of words, the memorable characters and its readability. However, these strengths are outweighed by the fact that the story moves too slowly as you often find yourself waiting for something of importance to happen. If an author is going to write a book of this length, he or she must be sure to keep the plot moving--Goodkind fails in this respect. Also, Goodkind goes beyond an average level of violence to images and events that are graphic, vile and just plain disgusting. What is worse is that these scenes have little bearing on the plot and just seem to be included for shock value. I don't recommend this book because it just isn't worth the time. Ok I am not going to try and compare this to the Wheel of Time series. The main reason being that I have never read the Wheel of Time series, although I plan on it. I have heard of the similarities and all I say is I don't care. This is hands down one of the best books I have ever read. I can't say it is my favorite because there are 6 books in the series and they are all equally fantastic. I have never cared about characters in a book as much as I care about these characters. I could not stop reading it. I read the last 600 pages in one day. I was hooked. As for Dragonlance, I think is is a great series, but nowhere close to SoT. This book has action galore, it is intelligent, and it never loses its focus. You find yourself rooting for the characters and holding your breath as you turn the page. You have to view this series apart from Jordan's. Even if he did borrow ideas, who cares? These books are so great I would reccomend them to anyone. Go read it, you will not regret it. 6 Years ago I bought this book,I read 20/30 pages and thought &quot;potboiler&quot;.In year 2000 that word still applies.If you have read any classic/cult fantasy in the last 20 years,then this book should be avoided.Why you ask?,well it is for those of you who read,David Eddings,Terry Brookes,Raymond Feist,Robert Jordan and that never ending stream of sausage factory Tolkein clones.Of course this may just be your bag,but if you want thought provoking fantasy,try the works of Robert Holdstock,Jan Seigel(Prosperos Daughters),Terry Windling,Charles de Lint,Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett(aka Lord Dunsany) And of course you could always read LOTR again for the 20th time.The worst thing about this type of series is that once you have bought the first you feel bound to buy the rest,in the vain hope things will get better.Just like Robert Jordans door stoppers,which by all accounts do not.Therefore, in summary we have a book which fulfils all the needs of the mainstream fantasy market,without really pushing back the boundaries(no pun intended)of fantasy writing.The style of writing maybe grittier and more involved,but it does not matter how many times you repaint and touch up an automobile,it's still the same beaten up piece of junk you bought 20 years ago. I can't believe the praises other reviewers have posted here. The book is way too long, underedited, in fact. The author wasted a good number of pages explaining things that are obvious to readers. This style may be beneficial to young fans but with themes like pedophilia and sado-masochism, it is clearly a mature book without the mature writing style. Yes, Mr. Goodkind is inventive in his plot twists and characterizations, the overall plot is a cliche. He also crammed the interesting parts near the end. As a result, the ending was rushed since too many important events are happening without much explanation. Probably because he devoted too much time on the little things (a crime the Wheel of Time series is also guilty of). I'd rather read Feist's books. Even if the plots are cliche, they are still good reading... I have all the books in this series and they are falling apart from constant reading. This way they won't wear out. People usually say that Goodkind has a lot in common with Jordan.The only thing I think he has in common with him is his ridiculously long books.Otherwise there are not as many pointless characters,the magic is as in depth as Terry Brooks,and the plot is fast moving and gripping.Richard Cypher,an unsuspecting person in the Westland,suddenly saves a mysterious woman called Kahlan Amnell,who tells him some disturbing news:Darken Rahl(the evil dude)has two of the boxes of Orden and is searching for the third one.She has come to the Westland searching for the only wizard powerful enough to destroy Darken Rahl.When the wizard turns out to be Richard's old friend Zedd,Zedd appoints him Seeker and gives him the mission to destroy Darken Rahl.This is a tale of romance,adventure,and wonderful magic .Buy it. I can understand, to a certain extent, the popularity of this series. It provides a fairly well done presentation of standard fantasy conceits and themes - a common man who becomes a hero, the old wizard, the evil master who is on the verge of conquering the world of good people, and the quest to defeat him via a powerful artifact or artifacts. These themes do work quite well - they resonate with readers on a very basic level. The problem, though, is that they have been literally done to death in the fantasy genre. In fact, the themes listed are those of the seminal high fantasy (swords and sorcery, if you will) text, Lord of the Rings. They have been reworked and repeated again and again - by Terry Brooks, by Robert Jordan, and by many others.Goodkind gains an advantage in his presentation by claiming not to be a fantasy author in the traditional fantasy, not a part of the clique, if you will. This may make him more approachable to those not accustomed to reading the genre, but it masks the fact that, when it comes right down to it, his series is in fact quite typical and even pedestrian (save, perhaps, in its very graphic violence). It's themes - even in detail - seem cribbed from other works (Jordan and Brooks in particular, but experienced readers will see Martin and Tolkien as well). Perhaps this is not unexpected, if one accepts these themes as archetypal in fantasy literature, and many of them are.But this very fact in the end demonstrates why Goodkind's series is really nothing special. It breaks almost no new ground in fantasy literature. In fact, much of modern fantasy - even high fantasy - overturns or twists the very archetypes Goodkind (apparently unknowingly) embraces, attempting to present a new perspective on the usual expectations. Though Goodkind's popularity stems from the fact that he - and his expected audience - do not know that his works fall into long established trends within the genre, his series must still be judged against those other works. Goodkind's assertion that he is not a fantasy author or fan does not mean he cannot be compared to other fantasy literature.Examined in this way, Goodkind's series - and this book in particular - cannot be seen as anything except second rate. The themes have been done and redone before. The writing itself is not noteworthy, rarely rising above the level of a pulp novel. In fact, the emphasis on graphic violence, the broad, simplistic, and stereotypical characterizations, and the pedestrian presentation all fit quite neatly into this category. Its themes, as discussed above, are typical fantasy fare, with almost nothing except minor detail to differentiate them. In fact, in many of these minor details one is reminded again of pulp literature - Goodkind's villian, Darken Rahl, has many aspects in common with classic comic supervillians.Certainly there is nothing inherently wrong with following the established boundaries of a genre, but at the same time any author who does so must exceed expectations with his or her work. He or she needs to present a story better crafted and more finely wrought than those of hsi or her predecessors. After all, those predecessors are the ones who first defined the limits of the genre, creating something new in the process - a writer who is following those footsteps cannot be noteworthy unless he or she surpasses those who came before. Goodkind fails in this; in fact, I would classify his work as pulp fantasy, akin to dozens of similar works - certainly nothing special or noteworthy within the genre.I do think that Goodkind's series is noteworthy for fantasy in one respect, however. In presenting it as literature first and fantasy second, Goodkind manages to break out of the literary ghetto fantasy literature has traditionally been placed in. As I stated before, this is the source of its popularity. But the real benefit of it, as I see things, is that once readers begin to compare Goodkind's works to what already exists within that ghetto, they will realize that fantasy literature in general isn't as tripe or absurd as is commonly believed (even though Goodkind's series will also be shown as nothing more than pulp fiction). The contribution of Goodkind's work, I expect, will be to reveal that fantasy literature does contain great works that deserve to be judged against \"standard\" literature on equal footing. Certainly, its legacy won't be to \"redefine\" the genre. The fact that Goodkind believes he is doing so, and that his series breaks new ground in fantasy, simply reveals how ignorant he is of the genre. OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; READ: 2000 (revised review early April 2012).CONCEPT: A young woodsman is chosen as the Seeker, a long lost position of power given to a warrior of ultimate good in distant lands. Now, he must go to those distant lands to face the Evil controlling it, as well as to deal with issues of truth. Along his journey, his position is tested as his love for his new lady love. (This didn't hit me as big of a concept as say HUMA or THE HOBBIT. But, it attracted a lot of fantasy readers, who tend to be more thinkers, and it holds a great deal of promise). MARKETING APPEAL: This story dealt with archetypes and LEVEL ONE readers; it was above average of most fantasy novels; used archetypes and the mythical Hero's Quest to appeal; good characters and focus on context; less on plot and surprises. Richard was very noble and easy to anger when faced with lies or difficult appeal; I think this resonated with many readers who are tired of the BS in our society and desire simpler times; characters are interesting but only on a simple level; if you want gray characters and profound thinking and interactions, you won't get it in this series. I suspect this is a VERY HEAVY LEVEL ONE series.SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)DIALOGUE: B STRUCTURE: B HISTORY SETTING: A- CHARACTERS: A- EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: C+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B+ SURPRISES: B MONSTERS: A- PACING: B LITTLE THINGS: B OVERALL STYLE: B FLOW OF WORDS: B CHOICE OF FOCUS: B TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B+ COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: BOVERALL GRADE: B to B+OVERALL STRUCTURE: Spent a lot of time building up the characters. This is much more a story of context and characters than of plot or fast action. A great deal of time is spent playing off the character relationships, describing the landscape and people and monsters and also in laying out the History. And actually, the History is pretty interesting as are the monsters. There were several character revelations which weren't surprising in this novel since it was so character focused. A few surprises and such, too. Richard Cypher is a good and moral character. Perhaps a bit too much. He is the typical innocent yet good youth (from mythology) who sets out on a mission where the odds seem insurmountable.WHY IT WORKED FOR ME: As described above, the monsters were orchestrated nicely into the ecology. The dragon character was fresh enough and the description of the travels along the wilderness were interesting. The interplay between Richard and Kahlan kept my interest. Enough tug and pull and conflict. Zedd was introduced naked which was interesting and new. He wasn't stereotypical either and had enough of his own lines to make him stand out more. Also, he wasn't some big buffed dude. I liked the way he manipulated in a good sense towards other people to achieve some better end, but still felt bad over it. The viewpoint of using a child and changing the word usage was good, too. The villain wasn't different but interesting enough. The sexual debauchery made them even worse. No doubt this was to create moral outrage. Have to say Richard is no warrior in the first novel but that's okay. He seemed to get out of jams enough times. Not clever. More noble and good that he gets others to help him as in the case of the Dragon. Interesting how Richard went through pain whenever he took a human life and had to deal with the results. Magic, in other words, has its limitations. Great details of the world and History; in regards to the lands being divided into three areas; the red fruit that is poisonous in the magical lands; the illusions used to fool the hero and heroine; the limitation of magic users; the confessor development and History; the Seekers and info. on their creation; the ecology of the monsters was something new and entertaining (many fantasy books forget that there are so many monsters that the ecological system would be destroyed); great interplay between the lovers even though some of the dialogue was a bit simple at times on Richard's part (of course, he's supposed to be a simple character so I won't hold this against the author). Pay attention to some of the names: DARKEN RAHL (for evil) and Richard Cypher (for DECIPHER since he's a seeker of truth). Those are the main ones which come to mind but I'm sure there are others. Also interesting were the little phrases that permeated the storyline, giving it texture. For instance, Zedd the high wizard had the best ones: \"Nothing is every easy.\" and \"Bags!\" (a swear word). One other thing I found interesting in relation to truth was Wizard's First Rule: \"People are stupid and will believe what they want to believe.\" This came in handy during the story when many of the townfolk were told to blame the good people for their problems and used those good people as scapegoats. So too, Richard's people were told that the magic lands were dangerous to their well being and created an army to put an end to it. It's little points such as this, as well as blends with style, that pushed this up from a solid B to a B+. It would have gotten even higher if the themes of truth had been elaborated upon more so. Why not have someone who is compelled to tell the truth all the time in difficult situations to show the flip side of being honest? Psychologists tells us that our society couldn't exist if everyone told the truth b/c it would come across as tactless and because most people aren't good at taking conflict or criticism. While being honest with your intimate partner is an ideal, being honest in the workforce or with people you hardly know can sometimes be destructive. Too much self disclosure to such types looks bad and weak. Another area that I felt was missed on truth was to develop the local populace opinions on what they felt was right. While Goodkind did a good job with it, I felt he could have really mined this area more to make it more thought provoking.FLAWS: Too much introspection can turn some readers off. The discussion of truth wasn't taken far enough or really hammered into the them big time. The part about Richard being a bastard child of the villain was revealed a bit late and made it anticlimatic. Perhaps it was intended and the next book will tell. The story lacked surprises. There were certainly a few but not enough for such a long novel. As I said above, it was more of a page turned for appreciation of the characters than a great moving story with lots of surprises and mysteries to it. It tended to be formulaic in the quest and perhaps it would have done Goodkind well to hold back some of the information of the story rather than reveal too much up front as he did. COMMENTS: A lot of details to characters and somewhat of a hit on truth and what is truth. For those interested in such areas, it's an entertaining read. I wouldn't advise this for people who don't like innocent, good hearted youths (since Richard dominates most of the text), or people who are more interested in a plot driven fantasyGRADE REASON: I am giving this an at the cusp B+ (higher than I give most fantasy novels) for the reasons listed above). The fact that Goodkind followed the typical mold of the innocent, good youth on a quest doesn't really place it any higher because it follows a typical pattern that has been done over and over by fantasy authors. So too, the love story got melodramatic at certain points (losing the feeling of this being love than just effects) and there weren't as many surprises as I felt there should have been. However, it had some truly amazing characters in it, even if parts of the love story got irritating at times. Moreover, the history setting of the land divisions, the rules on magic, the History of seekers, confessors and wizards, as well as the ecologically sound monsters pumped it up pretty high. There were certain points where it lagged at times, but perhaps that is attributed to the required page count of novels at a 1000 pages now. Very long. Geesh. It probably would have gotten a solid B+ or even an A- if Terry had analyzed more issues of truth and really pushed the limits upon the characters. However, since there was so much story to cover, I can see why there were problems in doing so. Perhaps additional books will cover these matters in the future. Of course, he would have had to develop his Evil antagonist beyond a caricature, too. I think it should be mentioned that Goodkind is dyslexiac and spends something like 12 hours a day working on his books (6 or 7 days a week). The man is obviously driven. Some have claimed he stole many ideas from Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME (I only read the first book in the series and found the passive male characters and constant meandering not to my liking) but I don't see this as much as they claim. If anything, I would take Goodkind over Jordan since there's more thinking in the head. It is no surprise to me, however, that this book broke the record and Terry was awarded $275,000 for the first novel. There are a lot of great ideas in here, as well as characters (if Richard's simple philosophies are not viewed as abhorrent) and it delivers on several components of the genre. All in all, this is much better than perhaps 75% of the fantasy books I have read in the past. Every once in a while something special happens...Often you have no control over that event, occasionally you do.If you want to read something that will leave you spellbound (pun intended), and asking yourself questions way after the book is complete then this is the novel for you.As much an encapsulation of most popular genres of fiction all rolled into one this book is not for the faint hearted, containing many suspenseful scenes, much horror and gore, packed with drama and a beuatiful love story in the making.Be warned the novel is quite lengthy, and may have you burning the midnight oil to reach its dazzling conclusion.Goodkind has an uncanny and rare talent for making you care about the fate of the characters and leaving each chapter craving you for more. Additionally, there is a fantastic fan based site on www.terrygoodkind.com where you are welcomed to discuss and debate all aspects of the book.This is the first novel in the 'Sword of Truth' Series and the tenth (including a brief prequel) is soon to hit the shops.Some people might be put off by the length of the novel (over 700 pages) but almost from the onset its an incredible tale and one which continues to build as the adventure unfolds.Some people might compare elements in the storyline to 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars' or a few other classics. I'd beg to differ - Its a tale that works on so many levels - there is an underlying philosophical structure, a multi layed intricately woven storyline and something that will appeal to teenagers and adults alike, each finding much to appease their interest.Try it for yourself.. what have you got to lose? The story and the writing style are excellent. The problem is that Mr. Goodkind likes to wallow in depravity. While many other modern authors (eg, Robert Jordon, Guy Gavriel Kay) also deal with cruelty, torture, sexual perversions and the like, they use it to show evil for what it is and &quot;go on.&quot; Goodkind, however, writes continually about it, focusing on it like some extremely unhealthy obsession with a death camp and its methods.Again, the story is good and the writing is lucid, but he leaves you feeling very dirty afterwords. This is, simply put, the junk-food equivalent of the fantasy world. If you seek semi-intelligent reading, this is not a book for you. The ridiculously derivative plot allows an experienced fantasy reader to guess nearly if not all plot \"twists\". It has an interesting and inventive story but is executed poorly. The writing is so bad it makes me want to throw it into a fire. The only thing that keeps me going is the story. It is a shame that the editors didn't have enough guts to get the author to rewrite or bring someone else in to co-author. Case in point: When Richard is going to Zedd's house we are told that the \"old mans house was to far to reach before dark and the trail too treacherous to travel at night.\" But when they leave the house 100 pages later, \"It was an easy trail, almost a road.\" If this is not the same trail, then why not take it in the first place? This is a slight example of a regular occurrence. Don't start this book unless you want to know first hand what bad writing is. This book was amazing. It had so much character development, and it really kept you reading till the last page.The next few books in the series were pretty good, the second equally as, but then it started to drag on a bit...The main character Richard started to seem a little too perfect. So if you want to start reading a complete series, I wouldn't reccomend this book, but if you want to just read a great fanatsy, then this is the one for you. I read this book years ago before I read Jordan's books. It is still fun to listen to, but wow did he copy all of Jordan's ideas? The only reason that I even bother saying anything about this book (or shall I call it a piece of junk?), is because almost every reviewer of this book likes it! I can say countless bad things about this book (the names, the descriptions, the bad atmosphere, the wierd characters and lots of more), but I'll concentrate on the major problem of this book (or is it in fact Goodkind's problem?):There is so much graphic violence, sex, torture and other disgusting things that is in this book! I feel pity for all the young boys (or girls) that have read this book, mainly because of the perverted Demin Nass who favours young boys!!!!!!!!!! What the hell is this Goodkind? Is this the kind of thoughts that are created in your mind?There are countless other perverted parts and other things that I would not like to mention, I believe that you all know what I mean. While I'll admit that it is not the most original concept in the world; Evil wizard, exotic women, magic sword; He takes such basic concept and makes them his own. But thats not the strength of this book. Goodkind is a master philosipher and really relays a powerful message in all of his books. He makes you really feel for the characters. All in all Goodkind is a master in the genre and doesn't get the respect he deserves. Who can read this DRIVEL? Poorly written, with an almost juvenile writing style. Boring. Predictable. The interactions between the Kahlen and Richard, laughable. They have known each other for, um, one day, and already she has \"a secret smile just for him!\" Ugh. I kept reading parts of it out loud to my family and LAUGHING! I had to quit after about 100 pages. I am surprised I managed to get that far and shocked that this is a bestseller. Compares in my mind to the Eragon books by Christopher Paolini, except his are written by a teen, and for a pre-teen and teen audience. Still can't stand them, though. I would skip this book without hesitation. Go buy George R.R. Martin, or even L.E. Modesitt instead; you'll thank me later. There are SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, kind of.1) Characters are *constantly* changing their tone. They'll use stiff language one sentence, shunning all use of contractions, then use contractions left and right the next sentence. I hate this. It detracts from their believability -- characters should have a consistent feel to them, and if their speech is stilted and distant in one sentence, their speech should continue to be stilted and distant. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, which there aren't in this case.2) Plot elements are thrown in willy-nilly. I like a good plot progression. I enjoy good writing. I hate it when an author smacks my head with a ten pound hammer to get a plot element across -- Zedd's a WIZARD?! Who would have guessed? Goodkind makes it nicely obvious, then (in case you missed it), makes it explicit, then (just in case you're a ...) has the protagonist talk about it alot.3) Logical consistency is lacking. The concept of the boundary is logically inconsistent with the heart hounds, the timing of the boundary makes no sense in relation to Zedd's being the high wizard or Darken Rahl's appearance, etc. etc. etc. It's been THREE GENERATIONS, folks. People who were around *BEFORE THE BOUNDARY* are still alive. Why are the characters so surprised by each other?4) The writing is inconsistent. One second Zedd will be giving a wonderful exposition of how a Seeker should act, the next his language is muddled and he's calling people 'dear one'. What up?I'm running out of space. This book bothered me -- the pubescent love-at-first-sight [stuff], the instant friendliness. There's a quote on the jacket from Marion Zimmer Bradley saying this book would \"sweep the country as Tolkien's work did...\" Good Lord, I hope not. What a waste of time that would be.- Andrew Wizard's First Rule is a great start to the Sword of Truth books, Goodkind is a master at his writing. At first read, Goodkind's book comes across as derivative. In fact, you'll make the inevitable comparisons to Tolkien, Jordan, Eddings, and others. While there are obvious nods to the above-mentioned it must be mentioned that the 'best' in the genre rip off from older traditions. Look at Joseph Campbell's writings on myth and its framework to see what I mean. Consider that the formula of 'farmboy-turns-saviour (even god?)' is used to effect by the above-mentioned, and has even been recycled as space opera in George Lucas' original 'Star Wars' films. Ditto for the Harry Potter series and alot of Disney's successful films, and you'll also find that Herbert's \"Dune\" (which is ostensibly a 'scifi' epic) is structured using this very same template.Let's face it folks... Goodkind's opening formula is NOT original, and has not been since that bygone day when Man first started telling stories. Hell, that's part of what makes it so good, and which makes the cycle worthy of standing amid the ranks of fantasy literature's luminaries. Does that make it bad? Absolutely NOT.All that being said, the second half of this book WILL throw you for a loop. Once the archetypal set-up is out of the way, it soon becoms apparent that the hero is both vunerable and fallible, not to mention weak on many levels, and Goodkind exploits these vulnerablilites to effect.I guarantee that by the middle act of \"Wizard's First Rule\" you'll be as flabbergasted about its outcome as I was. Goodkind takes these plot twists and builds upon them, and he's not shy about using more 'twists' in subsequent volumes of his series. I'm halfway through Book IV of the Sword of Truth cycke, and I have yet to be disappointed, but it has been a fun ride the entire time.Pick up this book. You'll be pleased. That's my affirmation of Truth. (wink) This comment is for Kindle readers only, who do not get Amazon reviews.I have been intrigued by the popularity of this series for a long time. So, when I saw it become available on the kindle, I purchsed it since I love fantasy. I have started it recently and it seems like pretty standard fantasy so far. I amwriting this now becausw Amazon deleted a Kindle review which was very helpful to me as it allowed me to set my expectations much more appropriately and also let me understand this story ccould be read on a standalone basis and the later books disappointed many readers. So I suggest you read some of the more balanced reviews on Amazon. I stilll bought the book, but with much different expectations. I hope that Amazon leaves this Kindle review posted since the other one helped me. Do not fear. You can pick up Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time seriesThe Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)and read what Terry Goodkind horribly tried to imitate. If you read them both you see what I mean. I did not believe the Wheel of Time was as great as everyone said but I enjoyed quite a bit and find myself waiting for each new book. The characters have more depth, the story line makes sense, and the action is realistic. Goodkind's characters just do whatever they need to to continue what almost passes as a story line. They do not follow descriptions or previous actions or dialogs. It reads like a child cheating at a role playing game. Great fantasy writing in English has one name, George R. R. Martin.A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1) Let me start by saying, \"What a FANTASTIC story!\" I am not an avid reader... it is rare that I pick up any fictional title. I mostly read non-fiction books if I read anything at all. I actually listened to the audio book during my lengthy car rides to/from work, over lunch, over dinner, while walking the dog, while going to sleep, etc. I lived deep within this book for over 30 hours, and loved nearly every minute of it.Rage, Love, Hate, Passion, Truth, Lies, Betrayal, Devotion, Triumph, Failure, Fear, Terror, Suspense, Anger and Pain are the many facets of this book. Invoking groans, laughs, discomfort, disgust, and compassion are some of Terry Goodkind's talents. I highly recommend this book (especially the audiobook) to anyone interested in starting a LONG series in this magical world of fantasy.In my relatively limited experience with fantasy novels, the characters are amazingly intelligent and observant, yet painfully slow to realize/act... often deliberating on some critical issue to the extreme. I found myself generally getting ahead of the character's thoughts... often knowing the answer to their problems before the author gets around to spitting it out. Don't get me wrong, I like knowing that I'm right, and I honestly think that agreeing with a character before they make up their mind makes one more empathetic with that character (perhaps what Goodkind intended all along). The lead characters are richly entertaining; each with a unique, albeit conveniently noble, history/lineage. Much of the book is predictable; not to say there were no twists, because I was misled as many times as I was on track.Goodkind really does make the characters come to life... you love and cheer for Richard, you wish you could wrap your arms around and gaze at the stunningly beautiful Kahlen, wish you could discuss philosophy with Zedd, and wish you could decapitate any number of villains (which I think he paints better than all the rest). Villains are deliciously evil in this book, perverting the idea of power over others (especially those who are helpless/defenseless), pushing the limits of reckless disregard for others' wellbeing, and poignantly portraying how corruptible political leaders can be. I am particularly impressed with how well Goodkind is able to make me disgusted with a young princess in the middle part of the book... I'd say more but I don't want to give anything away.I enjoyed how original the magic of this world seemed to me, and although I haven't started book 2 (I will tomorrow), I assume there will be much more to learn about the various different magics described in the first book. I also enjoyed the creatures in this book as they were familiar (like dragons) to non-typical night-wisps, deathly shadow creatures, even a carnivorous creature with a symbiotic relationship with blood-flies to help them locate their next meal...Overall it was a fantastical book with a good albeit \"typical\" fantasy plot... what really makes this book are the devious and perverse enemies, laughable and loveable heroes and the authors ability to craft suspense between sub-plots... and how could it not, there are so many hundreds of pages that I can't imagine this book not covering a little of everything. I stumbled upon Terry's work accidentally. I workout a lot and like to listen to books while I workout, so I was looking for a very long book to listen to...and I stumbled upon \"Wizard's First Rule\" by Terry Goodkind, which had over 30 hours of listening time. As I listened to the book I became enraptured with the characters and the storyline. I told my parents about this wonderful author by the name of Terry Goodkind and his Sword of Truth novels. My parents started the series - and have been fans ever since. Around the time I was finishing \"Stone of Tears\" (the second book in the series) I was having difficulty with my middle son. He started acting out, getting into trouble at school, bad grates, etc. He was diagnosed as ADD/ADHD when he was a young child so I have always struggled to keep him focused. As a form of \"punishment\" for acting out, he had to read out loud to me. I chose \"Wizard's First Rule\". He would read a page, I would read a page, and so on and so on...this would continue for an hour every night. On the third night he picked up the book, took it into his room and read without me. He informed me that he couldn't wait for me and that an hour a night was not enough. My son finished the series and has been an avid fan of Terry's since the first book...as has the rest of my family. My son is now in the Marines - and although he could have chosen many directions in the Marines, he has chosen to be an infantryman. Terry's books have captured my families interest and are inspirational. Also, I have three nephews that also have read and love Terry's books. When I first picked up this book I was looking for a hefty tome to keep me enthralled for a good long while. It's easier than finding something new to read a few days later. This book fit that description and promised future volumes with which to enchant me. Great. I could only hope now that it was a good series and we had a winner.Well this first book was truly great. I enjoyed it immensely and finished it in a little over a week. That's pretty good shelf life for me. I went out and bought the next book in the series, still good but not AS good. Onto number three, ok now there is a definate downhill slide that gets progressively worse as the stories continue. I was soooo disappointed, I really liked the first book and was truly eager to read a great big long series (at that time I think Goodkind was on book Six) and get lost in a different world. And I tried too! I kept reading them all despite my lack of interest, all the way up to book five and it just didn't get better, only worse. So I can't speak for future volumes of the saga but if you make it that far then you are a much more patient person than I.My advice would be to read this book, because it is very good, but leave it at that. You don't have to read any more of them for this to have a satisfying end. Of course there is the obligatory refernces that the evil wasn't completely destroyed, but hey you can just pretend it was. Because it was still alive in some form as far as book five and giving it that old geriatric try. The monotony was more frightening.I hope this was helpful. Bought this a number of years ago and only read a few pages. Then picked it up again and read through at upwards of a couple of hundred pages in a day. Agree with the comments about writing style but did not want to look ahead to his later volumes to see if his style has matured, and so my comments are specific to just this novel. Also agree the plot had many elements of other fantasy novels as well, though it also had some interesting twists. As some have pointed out, it starts out like it is written for young readers, but towards the end becomes very adult in its content.Yet in the end, it had me page turning for hours on end so clearly it easily held my interest. Despite issues of his writing style, he gets one critical element right. Fantasy series such as by a number of English writers flood you with too many characters too quickly. The result is you lose the plot trying to remember who a particular character is and why you should care. Goodkind introduces characters and then spends enough time that you remember them the next time they show up. This helps the plot move along at a good reading pace.There were enough twists, turns, and surprises to balance out the groaners. Remembering that this was the first novel in the series, the real question is whether you would want to read the next. I usually alternate series, but in this case, I am moving into Volume 2 right away. Four starts for the first novel flaws, but otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable reading. The Wizard's First Rule is an excellent book that created a very believable alternate world with a relucant hero who uses strong character traits to win the respect of all with whom he works or battles. He is exceptionally believable in his behavior and holds to his values, making him an exceptional character. The story has some great twists and turns that are totally unexpected. The ending is exceptionally satisfiying, to the point I have gone back a reread it a few times just to relive the satisfaction.This was my first experience with this author, but certainly not my last. He is on my list up there with Orson Scott Card for writing the most believable fantsy with well-crafted characters. This book had potential. But turned me off with the sadistic torture of children. Unnecessary. One of the reviews on the cover compare it to the work of Tolkien. That is a stretch. this book is great. Up to par with Tolkien. An amazing storyline and an amazing ending. Two-thumbs up. If you like a well written fable of a young man who grows into his manhood with liberal sprinklings of magic, swordfights, adventures and a bit of romance then this is for you. This is a totally engrossing story which will whisk you away to a far land where you can spend many happy hours exploring and living the life of a hero. I'm not going to tell you the ending but the hero ........... Mild spoiler alerts in this review. A standard fantasy structure: humble young protagonist who grows into the hero he was meant to be, opposes powerful evil ruler, aided by magical companions, motivated by a deep romantic love and a world-saving calling, on a long journey through detailed, beautiful, and treacherous landscapes, and undergoing various sub-quests along the way. The author has a penchant for manipulative and graphic sado-masochistic scenes, and there's quite a bit of fantasy violence and endurance that exceeds credibility, but what else would one expect? Goodkind is striving for a balance of believability and world consistency within his premise. I often find the promise more enticing than the product; some of his ideas were intriguing, such as the boundaries between the worlds, and the drama of passing through the boundaries. Goodkind's Ayn Rand-ian views came off well when voiced as wizardly lore. This is the first book of a long series, and I felt it tried to do too much; the ending was too convenient to be satisfying. I felt less and less engaged as I read through this book, and by the end I was not inclined to read more in this series. This whole series is one which will be a classic as the Tolkien books. Terry Goodkind's ability to make a novel so real you can see the event happening as you read. I could not put any of these books down. Thank you, Terry for many hours of breathtaking enjoyment. This the first book in a huge saga of books that follows the tale of Richard Cypher and the start of his epic tale and the meaning behind what is happening to him. I first found out about this series watching season one of the Sword of Truth tv series and I wanted to read the series after that. After reading this book I realized that this is an amazing story. The author isn't afraid to write about anything, which can make this quite interesting.Even though it may seem as a straight forward evil versus bad type of book, it does have its grey areas and I think it really expands upon Richard as a person. He goes to a ton of places throughout the story and he does have various combat situations that pop up and can become really intense. It all leads to a very satisfying conclusion.The writing and editing IMO are well done. I read through the 800 pages seamlessly and didn't have to stop reading due to bad writing. The quality of the book is pretty well and even though it had a bunch of creases in the middle after I read it, it didn't fall apart or I lose any pages.If you're a fan of middle ages themed book with a great story and tons of action, I recommend this book to you. I really enjoyed this book and the great start to a long series of books. For some reason, this is one of those books that people have strong opinions about. I scanned through many of the reviews of WFR and was suprised to find quite a few angry pans of it. I can understand those who think WFR is flawed and that Goodkind's writing is strange. I can even understand the claims that WTR borrowed themes and ideas from other fantasy writers. I caught myself thinking the same things about WFR. However, what I don't understand is the pathos of some of Goodkind's critics here. They seem darned angry about WFR's success for some reason.I suspect some of it has to do with Goodkind's arrogance. I must admit, judging from what Goodkind says in his interviews, he does come off as a pompous, self-important jerk. It's quite clear that Goodkind takes himself very seriously, and that he also seriously believes--as his book often points out--that people are stupid. Of course, all you have to do is look at the pictures of Goodkind to figure that out. The guy actually LOOKS like a jerk. But, I think that art should be judged separately from the artist, and so, I'm willing to overlook Goodkind's obvious egomania, although I am sympathetic to those who find it distasteful.The rest of the ire spewed in Goodkind's direction revolves around the character of his writing. The claim is frequently made, for instance, that WFR borrows heavily from other fantasy authors. However, I don't know of many fantasy authors who don't borrow heavily from the grand daddy of fantasy fiction, J.R. Tolkein. Without the Lord of the Rings, many of today's writers would be pretty hard up for material. The key though to using the ideas of other authors (and yes, all authors do this whether they claim to or not) is to take only the essence of the idea and somehow change it, filter it, mutate it until it becomes more a product of your own thinking than the originator's. So, when I happened upon a Gollum-like character midway through WFR, I worried that Goodkind was traipsing on thin ice. Then, of course, that character had an extremely minor role (about 20 pages and very little dialog) and seemed to me to be a very different kind of character than the one many of you will be aquainted with from LOTR. Apparently, there are other more egregious plagiarisms in WFR, but I'm willing to bet that the parallels seen by other critics are a bit exaggerated for the sake of justifying their dislike for Goodkind.Additionally, many critics dislike the sadism and overt sexuality of some of the passages in WFR. However, I believe these criticism are also exaggerated. At no point did I find the sexuality, rape, or torture present in WFR to be gratuitous. All of the depictions of violence and depravity in WFR had a purpose to the story. I think it's a good thing for authors to depict these kinds of depravity in an explicit and horrible light because they are indeed horrible things to behold or be the victim of. No one should be flippant about the psychic and physical impact of rape, murder, or torture. I believe that Goodkind's writing attempts to depict real suffering on the part of his characters and in doing so draws an enlarged empathy from his readers. Shying away from those subjects would remove a great deal of the emotional impact of the story.My own criticism of Goodkind is that his interpretation of love is dismally simplistic, and far too sexual in nature. Love is not limited to male/female partenships, yet again and again, the main character, Richard, is propelled by his love of Kahlan as by no other motivating force. I've seen this kind of drivel before in many forms and it always strikes me as (sadly) a very male interpretation of love. The idea always seems to be that the \"power of love\" and specifically, sexual love, will overcome all obstacles. History shows this to be an abysmally ill-conceived notion. In fact, the love demonstrated in WFR is of a fundamentally selfish and one-dimensional nature. That's very unfortunate since Goodkind built the entire story of WFR around this very kind of love.Additionally, to use the \"Power of Love\" to turn the sword of truth white--to kill with the \"Power of Love\"--strikes me as a desecration of love itself. I've heard of ideas like this before, but it's usually from boyfriends and husbands who beat their wives. \"I beat her because I love her so much,\" is the kind of rhetoric you'd hear from them. Goodkind takes pains toward the end of the book to show how love and brutality can become linked and that it's unhealthy, yet he falls into the trap of justifying brutality if it's done with the \"Power of Love.\" The \"Power of Love\" is a trite and dangerous idea, one I wish more authors would avoid, and I'm disappointed that Goodkind is so simplistic (and ignorant) in this regard.However, there are good points to WFR. Its pacing is great, and the plot twists are often jarring (in a good way). The story kept me on my toes and held my interest...no small feet after 800 pages. I also applaud Goodkind's attempt to inject emotion into his story, something other fantasy authors are often reluctant to do to the degree Goodkind has. It's refreshing to see fantasy subject matter depicted in this manner.But, in the end, I don't recommend this book. While the intent behind WFR is interesting and inspiring, its execution is poor...including the editing. The first 40 chapters were great, so I bought the whole 9 book set... too bad the writer has a morbid fascination/imagination in chapters 40 plus... I would not recommend this book to anyone.. sorry While this book has all the basic fantasy elements, an old wizard, a hesitant hero and a strong love interest.. It makes the entire experience new with the amazing hero's and the characters that you can really root for and that are amazing to follow since they make mistakes and they are relatable. The story also has amazing philosophy that speaks to everyone about life and the value of each person. This is a MUST READ that simply cant be put down, and will have you racing for the next installment in the series. This book was my first experience with science fiction fantasy. I couldn't have made a better choice. Wizard's First Rule was spellbinding from the first page to the last. The characters were real and extremely likable. I look forward to reading each book in the series. this was an incredibly great book. if u r into great fantasy books then u really need to try out this goodkind book. it will have everything tthat u could want in a book. A friend of mine pointed out to me that there was a new show called \"Legend of the Seeker\" based on books by Terry Goodkind. i instantly remebered reading Wizard's first rule and after watching a few of the episodes on TV and enjoying them i went to the library and brought Wizard's first rule home and started to engulf myself in it.......then i realized how much i hated this book. My 4 year old daughter has the same writing skills as Mr Goodkind does. the characters seemed to change on how they acted from page to page. The \"original\" story lines we outstanding. I mean when you think of the sword of truth nothing comes to mind like Terry Brooks.....i mean Goodkind, and lets not bring up all the little stuff he ripped of from Robert Jordan (yes his books got a little tiresome too but that was after book 5 or 6 not chapter one in book 1 ). I had to stop after ten chapters just to keep my sanity. if you want to read something fun and original try Brandan Sanderson's \"Mistborn\" series and his \"Elantris\" solo book. These books are fresh and fun with great writing. This is the book that got me hooked reading fantasy novels. You will not be disappointed. This book is the first in a series called the sword of truth series. It has your basic fantasy elements (magic, wizards, evil people trying to bring the world into utter darkness, soldiers, beasts that can fly) and will keep you reading right to the end to see how the story finishes.To be honest the reason I love the book so much is because it has a compelling love story between the main character Richard Cypher and a woman he meets named Kahlan. The world that Terry Goodkind creates is very descriptive and the characters believable. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fantasy lover. Also if you like this book you'll definitely like \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R.R. Martin. The most striking piece of Terry Goodkind's _Wizard's_ First_ Rule_ was the re-creation in prose of a Sam Peckinpaugh-esque cinematic device: the slow-motion death of a villain, described in vivid detail as the his head erupts in a spray of gore, courtesy of the protagonist's sword. It captured a phenomenon I have experienced in real life, temporal distortion. While some will find that sort of imagery offensive, the scene had me &quot;inside the story.&quot; The same was true of some scenes near &quot;the Boundary,&quot; an interesting device that is well thought out.Sadly, these gems are exceptions that highlight a long winded tale. The story lacks timing and punch, although I admire the sustained effort to capture the sarcastic banter common among team members sharing a difficult task. Magic is far too commonplace to allow any sense of connection to &quot;reality&quot; -- the suspension of deibelief required is too great. Contrast with Jordan's first WoT book, where the wonder of &quot;magic&quot; shows how rare it is, and how it intimidates normal mortals.In general, the characterizations aren't deep enough, and the contrived emotional tension between Richard and Kahlan is overdone. The vignette covering the abuse/brainwash/mutilation of a preadolescent boy seemed out of place in this story, a mere &quot;proof&quot; that the villain is thoroughly evil. We didn't need gratuitous child brutality to figure that out.Insofar as providing a setting/world/background, this book falls woefully short of many other works. Descriptions were eratic, and did not paint a very complete picture of the setting.Do I have the patience for the next three books of this series, hoping the style will tighten up? The size of the paper backs does not bode well for that outcome. I give Goodkind credit for energy and productivity, however page count does not equate to greatness. It is the quality of the paragraphs that make for enjoyable reading, not the quantity.For those entusiastic readers who gush about Goodkind being the next Tolkein, or on the same level as Martin or Jordan, you obviously have not read enough different styles or genres. Try some regular fiction, some non-fiction, some short stories. Read the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, at the very least. You will see that a tight prose style is a key ingredient to successful story telling. When reading high fantasy, I rarely have high hopes as to originality of plot, and there were no surprises here. I do generally expect more writing skill and better dialogue than Mr. Goodking bothered to provide. The dialogue seemed forced on almost every occasion; the writing seemed to be that of a sophomore in high school. If it weren't for the low standards I hold the genre to, I would have rated this book as a 1. Being a long time magic lover, I fell in love with the story after reading the first page. It was mesmerizing, filled with excitement, humor, wisdom and human frailty. It was easy to read and provided hours and hours of total entertainment. I highly recommend this to anyone who misses Harry Potter. I have read fantasy since I was seven years old (starting with C.S. Lewis and Tolkien), and this book was on the 2nd grade reading level. The authors writing style was simplistic and redundant, and 90 percent of the images in the book were hackneyed and trite. The Bone Woman and multiflavored Gars were the worst. The only original part of the book concerned the Mord-Sith and the still somewhat cheesy training by pain. If you want a serious good book do not look here. I have never been an avid reader of fantasy novels, yet Goodkind has spellbounded me with his wondorous writing style and magnificent characters. You begin your read with such appreciation for the pace and direction of the story, that putting it down is almost painful. His characters are strong, intelligent yet not above pain and suffering. They are each representative of who we are in so many ways, and who we fantasize to be in our minds. The story itself never stops moving, not for a second. I loved that best of all! Terry does not write this book as a screenplay for Hollywood (as so many authors I find do today) he writes this as a true storyteller. I cannot say enough positive things about this book. Treat yourself by engulfing your mind into a fantastic story of love, hate, strength, weakness, and best of all magic! I hesitated when giving this book a 4 star rating because my impulse was to give it 5. After some thought I decided to give it 4 stars instead when compared to 'Lord of the Rings' books for example which are masterpieces. I first became aware of the book through a friend that shared my love of reading. I was blown away by the vast complex world and I was hooked. I have since read the entire 'Sword of Truth' series as well as all of Goodkind's books.The story centers around Richard Cypher, a woods guide, who becomes our eyes and ears in this magical world. He is as mesmerized as we are by the strange landscape and inhabitants. He travels through this new world after the death of his father with a young woman he saved from four men which makes the beginning of his perilous journey. This wonderful tale is written with excellent descriptive and detailed language. The character development is intricate and satisfying for a reader. You manage to get invested quickly and end up scratching your head after going through eight hundred twenty pages as fast as you did.Beware of the violence: torture is the favorite pastime of the evil. If you have a weak stomach, this may not be your book.In conclusion, if you are looking for a good story with great characters, and wizards, and dragons, and magic, then this is your cup of tea. The overall story has clich&eacute;d elements but the heart of the story is interesting and refreshing. I read this book/series at least once every couple of years. It makes me happy. :) Nice little door stopper/paper weight/S&amp;M novel form the writer who apperently thinks that if a book has enouth words in it it will somehow reach criticall mass and become good I thought this was a good book. It's easy to read, has easy to like characters and the plot is not to difficult to discern. Read it for yourself, develop your own opinion, and you may find that you like the book better than you thought you would. The good:The first 300 pages. Careful and sensitive location and environment descriptions, primarily in the woodland areas. It's worth also mentioning the spine-chilling chapter where Richard & Kahlan are in the middle of the boundary crossing, which is written brilliantly - It'll make your hair stand on end! At this point I thought I was in for a cracking read.The bad:Almost the whole of the rest of the book, starting with the mind-numbing stay with the mud-people. The uninteresting sections of this book go on for just far too long. The last 100 pages descend into soap-operatic farce, with almost any improbable scenario being made up in a rush to get to the excedingly disappointing climax.The Unnecessarily perverse:I do not want to read 75 repetitive pages detailing torture and horrendous cruelty if it does little in terms of developing the plot. I do not want to read descriptions of children being raped, molested and killed, even if it does help develop the plot. I understand the need for mature content, but this type of subject matter pops up far too often to make reading this book an enjoyable experience for any decent person.I was ready to love this book after I read some great sequences near the beginning - to be fair there are some original ideas, and Goodkind's writing style has a soft sensitive warmth at times that I haven't come across elsewhere. However, ultimately as time wore on it wasn't enough to stop my mind wandering, and when the end arrived I found myself breathing an apathetic sigh of relief. Is that abomination of an editorial review supposed to be helpful? I'm left wondering if the editorial reviewer actually read the book!Wizard's First Rule is one of the most unique and intriguing books you'll ever read. The characters are a fascinating representation of the true human condition; their interactions, relationships, challenges and journey will draw you in, deeper and deeper, until you've completed the entire series and are left hungry for more.Human issues, romance, murder/mystery, war, religion, thriller, fantasy, philosophy. This book has everything and more.CMCEverett, WA Wizards First Rule begins to take you on an adventure that will challenge you. Once the book is picked up you can become totally engulfed in what is going on. You see the challenges that Richard, Kahlan and Zedd will face and end up cheering them on as the story progresses. Which will win? What will the outcome be? Richard and Kahlan are characters that are believable. You can get lost in the book. It was a rewarding read. I loved taking the lessons that were learned in the book by Richard and Kahlan and seeing how they ended and how the characters changed through the series. I know I learned a lot of life lessons from the series and look at things differently. I am a better person because of it. Wizards first rule and the series reminds you of the important things in life that we often forget to remember or take the time to do. I learn something new every time I read the book. Thank you. Wizard's First Rule is only the beginning to the most hauntingly beautiful and enthralling story I have, and will ever have read. It lays predcessor to five other books that match and consecutively and increasingly improve upon what I first percieved as pure literary genius. After reading all six books, Sword of Truth has made all other books I have read in the past and ever book I have picked up since seem pale and dull in comparison. Read these books. I picked this book up on the recomendation of a book seller and I was desperate for something new to read.The first time I tried to read it, I didn't get through the first chapter. I should have taken it back and demanded my money back. But I tried it again years later. I can read 2 or 3 books a day, but it took me 2 weeks to slog through this drivel.It's so forgettable that I remember now is that it had a hero... no worthwhile female characters and someone that liked to torture along with sex so that they would become intertwined. Gee thats really uplifting. I have seldom read a book I have despised more. Imagine if Christopher Paolini had decided to write Wheel of Time fanfiction. That's what this is. Oh, and it gets served up with a side of Ayn Rand (excuse me while I vomit).Is it bad? Well, kinda; I really would place it about on the same level as Eragon in terms of originality (none) and writing style (juvenile). However, I put it lower for two reasons: Paolini actually WAS just a kid (granted, a kid with publisher parents) whereas Goodkind was not; and Wizard's First Rule spends a great deal of space on some rather unpleasant topics (murder, rape, torture [much of which has sadomasochistic overtones]) which would be difficult to handle even in the hands of a more gifted author. With Goodkind it's just miserable.The characters are cutouts, Richard in particular. I would say that all of them, again especially Richard, get worse as the series wears on (starting off here as bumbling dupes and eventually turning into sociopathic dictators to serve as the author's mouthpiece) but I'll try to restrain myself to just this book. The world is rather flat and unrealistic, with nothing that really pops out. Unlike, say, Jordan. They both use lots of words, but Jordan turns his words into worlds. Goodkind just lets them stay words. The fantasy elements don't really work, but then Goodkind has said that it isn't really fantasy; he's somewhat ashamed to be considered such.I've been told that this is actually the best of the series; I only made it through the first three before deciding I really could find better things to do with my time. Would I recommend it? Eh, if you want something that's not too taxing and you don't expect much from it, I guess this one (AND ONLY THIS ONE) is okay. Otherwise, just skip it. Don't waste your time on Terry Goodkind. He doesn't have an original story element in any of his books. I have read his first several books in the hope of finding something interesting. Unfortunately, he apparently can't come up with his own ideas. If you have read much fantasy, you will recognize ideas he has lifted from Tolkien, Jordan and a number of other authors with actual talent. In some cases it is so blatant that I wonder the other authors don't sue for copyright infringement. Don't waste your time or money on these books. Read the originals. I read this book on a recomendation of a friend. It took a bit of effort to get started. It started out a Luke Sywalker Character then he meek Ben Zoolander Kanobi and Princes Leigha. Out of the blue Richard Sywalker saves some random girl that comes wandering by his home. He has some megomanic brother that has gives this speech against fire. Richard Skywalker finds out that Drunken Darth Rahl is planning to take over the world and he gets the light saber of truth. I would even venture to say that there is the Han and Chewy characters.I would have given the book four stars up to 3/4 of the book. The main characters can't comunicate and hold a great deal of secrets from \"best friends\". It is very plausable that Darth Rahl would have been stopped if the whole group stayed home and not bothered. There is some quest for the last box to complete the total control of the universe. The box is secured from Darth Rahl and the good guys get their hands on it and get it back to Rahl.There are so many missed opertunites and walking into traps. I didn't mind the sex and violence and creepy characters. That was the best part of the book because the rest of it was so lame. They seem to have it won then they screw it up or by the way there is a spell you have to go back.The philosophy and set up for the story was really good despite the overly good characters. The quest was fun trying to figure where the box was. They have it in their hands and just when things are settled by the way something really messed up happens. That happens four or five times. Finally Richard Skywalker ends up in a confrontation with Darth Rahl and uses a lame trick to save the day. I read this book awhile ago and a friend recently asked to borrow it from me. I gave it to her. I got through the first book barely and a couple chapters into the secound book I just gave up. This book was so predictable, and not in the \"wow I want this to happen\" way. The main characters were way overdone and not at all interesting. I just couldn't find anything I enjoyed about the book when it was done. I had a hard time getting into this. It took me awhile to get everyone straight and to figure out what was going on. Once I did, I enjoyed it very much. The rough start could have been helped if I had read the prequel BEFORE I read this one. But alas, I failed to do that and didn't pick up the prequel until I had closed the curtain on book #1. There is a formula that books in this genre follow, this one was no different, but I enjoyed the journey to the same old story/plot/ending. I will try book two of this series as well. Advice to Goodkind: If you *must* imitate someone, it's best to imitate someone better than merely adequate. But this isn't a Wheel of Time review. No, it's about the tawdry little thing called Wizard's First Rule. The predictable Gandalf-clone mentors the predictable Rand-clone into the Full Use of His Awesome Powers (tm). There are a few (woefully rare) excellent stylistic moments, but the plot is strictly by-the-numbers and the characterization is down there with Larry Niven. I finished it, but it was a pretty boring slog through the last third, after I realized Goodkind wasn't going to really work with the relationship of overwhelming rage to good/evil at all, which was the one interesting core idea in the book. Still, Piers Anthony sells books, so I suppose *somebody* finds this worthwhile, and who am I to spit on their little pleasures? By all means, read W1stR, and get the rest of 'em if it appeals to you. It keeps Goodkind off the public dole, and I suppose someone would have processed that wood into pulp anyhow. I love the Sword of Truth series - I've been reading it for years and with two novels left to read, am very excited to reach the end. Goodkind's main abililty is creation of characters that you truly care about; they grow and change as the series goes on, they have real motivations and reasons for the things they do, and they have flaws which make them human (or whatever race they happen to be). New characters move in and out of the series, creating a large network that gives a sense of a real world. His themes range from the more traditional fantasy, like love and power, to the very contemporary, like rape and child molestation. This merging of the two worlds is perhaps Goodkind's greatest achievement.That being said, like any author, Goodkind has his flaws. He does have some very hackneyed plot points, most evident in this, his first novel. He grows as a writer, however, as the series continues and starts to move away from overused ideas to some truly original creations. Goodkind is no Robert Jordan, though, and lacks in seriously intricate plot weavings and political manuervering. But by the same token, you won't need a glossary just to have a clue what's going on. His main weakness is with language, where he stuggles with more adult sentence creation and word choice. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; it does make the series very accessible. And although Goodkind has a way with people, he lacks in his creation of a robust landscape. This is very evident in his map, which is by no means a Tolkienesque feat. The world is really just a large area cut into three pieces.Overall, if you're willing to commit to a series of 12 books (most end on a cliff-hanger so you'll probably be stuck in the series before you know it) the Sword of Truth series is a worthly addition to almost any fantasy lovers bookshelf. There are a lot of self published books that are far better written than this thing. Very slow going, the hero is presented as some sort of imbecile, the characters aren't engaging. Don't waste your time. Wizard's First Rule was full of fast paced battles, inticate puzzles,an exciting plot line,and agreeable characters which blinded me from ever noticing the book's size. Richard,the main character,starts off as a normal woods giude when a conffesor crosses the boundary and changes his life,this starts thier heart pounding journey to save everyone from the merciless rule of Darken Rhal. This book contains all the great elements action,romance,drama,and even some comic relief. Terry Goodkind has woven a wonderful story that surpassess the writing of many of the great fantasy authors I have read.This is how Jordan should have written Wheel of Time series. Wizard's First Rule is for everyone to enjoy. The first book is a tediously slow start to what ultimately becomes a very engrossing and detailed epic. Why then are there many low and mediocre reviews? There is an underlying ideological theme that develops as the series unfolds. The first book takes a long time to develop due to the intricate plot and scope of the full series. Anyone who sees the book as simple, trite, hackneyed, etc. simply does not posses the intellect to comprehend so many contiguous and interwoven storylines, plots and characters. You either get it, or you don't. The underlying \"political\" ideology regarding the evil of a government that dictates \"what's best for the common good of the people\", will bring cheers from those more conservative minded readers, and jeers from more liberal readers. Book review on Wizard's First RuleA trail guide, Richard, finds a lady, Kahlan, in the wood that is being pursued; he later finds out that she is of a high status. The lady tells him that the barrier dividing her region from his is failing and will soon be gone. Shortly afterwards he is appointed a Seeker of Truth by his old friend, Zed, who turned out to be a wizard. He goes out to avenge the death of his father, who was killed by Darken Rahl. In his quest for truth he was finally able to prevail against Darken Rahl.The book Wizard's First Rule was influential because it showed how righteous anger can be a good thing if you know how to use it since it allows you to finish your goal. Anger also has a negative side that can make you do things that you regret later. The book also shows that the truth is not what always what you want to hear. Another influential part is the wizards first rule \"People are stupid, given proper motivation; almost anyone will believe almost anything.\" The book Wizard's First Rule was very influential to me.The book tells me that all people have a temper just some people can hold it better that others and since all people are stupid. It also shows that some people side with the power hungry people who have a larger probability to win because of their unethical methods. The power hungry people will eventually be overthrown by the rest of the public who dislike the person. It also shows that in the short time that those people are in power they can do irreversible damage. The book revealed some things about people that I hadn't known previously.The author style was narration with short paragraphs and chapters. The author also used many adjectives to give a vivid image in your of the setting. He gives all his characters unique personalities and makes sure you don't forget them. Wizard's First Rule is a very enjoyable read. I was recommended this series by a work mate who also put me onto Game of Thrones. Reading this book straight after finishing all the Game of Thrones books is probably not a good idea. They are two totally different reading experiences. I have to admit although I love the story in Wizard's First Rule, and all the information about magic, I found the dialogue a bit wooden and not very sophisticated. The thing which irked me the most was the character of Rachael the little girl talking about \"having to go potty\". I know she's only a little child but really...it just grated on me...Also, Samuel seemed very much like Gollum from Lord of the Rings and the Mord-SITH??? Star Wars anyone??? But, in spite of all of this I recognise it's a totally different book, series of books, and a totally different writer to Game of Thrones. Having said that, after I finished each GOT book I was desperate to start the next one, whereas with this one, well I have bought the second book in the series, because I do want to follow Richard and Kahlan on their journeys, but I am not desperate to begin just yet...So, all in all I enjoyed it very much, and in spite of referencing other fantasy/sci fi stories it's a very original story. I am glad I read it and I will pick it up again in the near future. &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; shows the brilliant and creative imagination of Mr. Goodkind. I found myself unable to place the book down. His intriguing and descriptive usage of words, pull you in from the first to the last page.This book displays a mixture of fantasy, mystery, and suspense. Towards the end of this book, you think you have finally solved the puzzle, when out of no where, Goodkind adds another detail and the puzzle--you realize--is now missing pieces. Once again, you must put your mind to the test and rearrange the characters, conditions, and settings. At times, it is very contradicting!Throughout the story, Kahlan Amnell, Richard Cypher(Rahl)--a once quiet and modest woodsman, and Zedd--the last of great wizards--stand together to battle evil and protect the innocent throughout the lands of Westland, the Midlands, and D'Hara. During their journey's, Richard discovers many dark secrets about his past and is named the Seeker.The Seeker carries the Sword of Truth--now you understand where the series' title comes from--and searches in the name of truth. Richard travels to D'Hara and the People's Palace primarily to stop Darken Rahl and to destroy the boxes of Orden. During the course of the tale, things turn out as hoped, but other things fail. At the end of the book, you want to run to the library and pick up the sequel in order to find out what happens.I recommend all of the books in the Sword of Truth Series! Amazingly, the sequels are always getting better and better!Though some argue that Mr. Goodkind's books tend to be on the graphic side, I tend to think that because they are graphic, it means Mr. Goodkind has been able to place words in such a way, we are able to picture what he is writing. Only talented writers such J.R.R. Tolkien and Terry Goodkind are able to make the words flow with such intensity. After having read this book for the third time, I'm still not entirely sure what I think about it. There are parts of it I like, there are parts of it that I hate and in this book they are more or less evenly mixed. While I feel that there are some glaring issues in this book that detract from the overall story, it's not as bad as the books that come later in the series. It is a little bit difficult to forget what is coming and that does give me a slightly more unfavorable than I would otherwise.The story in this book is really pretty interesting. There are some unique characters and adventures that take place that drag you deeper into the story but there are also some things that I feel were borrowed from other fantasy series. This makes me lose a little respect for the author but it's pretty popular in fantasy series these days so it's not that major. The story is intriguing and keeps the book moving forward but sometimes I had issues with the pacing. It was like jumping from major event to major event without much down time between. I prefer to really get into the story rather than just jumping into danger after danger after danger. That's probably more personal preference than anything else.One of the other things I really didn't like about this book (or this series) is some of the characters' inconsistencies. I don't need perfect realism in my characters but I should be able to relate and believe them. Their emotions and actions should make sense given what I've been told about them. I don't feel like this is a case a lot of the time. One character that this really irritates me with is Kahlan. In several scenes, she is almost on the point of killing someone only to be crying on their shoulder or cuddling with them the next. It doesn't make sense and is unrealistic. It's highly unlikely that she would have revealed as many of her secrets as she did to Richard on their first day of meeting, much less spent the night cuddled up with him. Nor is it realistic that as soon as Richard sees her (from a vast distance, no less) that he's already head over heels in love with her. There is nothing wrong with love in books, it's a natural human emotion. But love doesn't develop instantaneously as it seems to have this pair. Nor are many people as inconstant in their emotions as a lot of his characters seem to be. Kahlan can either be a strong character or be a weak, typical woman. It's demeaning to her as a character to make her both simply to advance the love story along or make her more relatable.But that isn't the only issue that really bothers me with this book, there's more. I dislike the way Richard is sometimes. At some points, he's a wonderful, respectful young man who is always eager to help and avoid fights. Other points, he is completely intolerant of other people and their cultures. He is even described that way when they are with the Mud People (really original name there). If the story is going to have one clear, cut hero the reader really should like him. And at this point, I don't.Additionally, there are several points in this books where the author clearly trumpets his views using a thin veneer of story. If you think Socialism is evil, that's fine but I don't want to read about it in your fiction. Write a nonfiction about it and be done with it. I don't want conscious allegory; I don't want to feel like I'm reading a scene written only to reveal the evil of a worldview; I want to read a fantasy novel that may make me think about those things. But please, don't insult the reader's intelligence. Most of us don't need taken by the hand and led to your beliefs. I'll get it whether or not you clearly spell it out and have a lot more respect for you as a writer for it.All in all, the story is pretty decent but it is constantly let down by its writer. From what I remember of the series, it only gets worse at it goes on but we'll see as I give this series on last chance. If you're looking for an exciting, intelligent fantasy series, I'd highly suggest A Song of Ice and Fire or The Wheel of Time. Both of them provide a better, more immersive reading experience without leaving a lot to be desired. I find it hard to believe that some folks are giving this book 4 (or FIVE???) stars. This book is awful.First the good. From the first page, to the last, there were 2 decent memorable scenes. During those scenes, I had to force my imagination to fill in some detail, and ignore the dreadful prose.One scene was the creature with the flies on it.The second scene was our heroes navigating through the \"secret\" break in the impenetrable force field. (Oh, there MUST be a break in the impenetrable force field you see, because our hero MUST get through... SOMEHOW!)As a general statement regarding the good parts, they only rate \"good\" because they were interesting IDEAS presented with the ever present junior high school writing style.That's it for the good.Now for the bad. The main character, Richard (bleh) is about as sappy, and cliche as possible. The female that he's going to cliche fall in love with (you'll know it's part of the cliche plot it's so bad) is as cliche and syrupy as possible. I can't even remember her sappy cliche name. Probably \"Mary\" or something equally uncreative.The cardboard characters move around the cardboard world with all the excitement and stilted emotion of paper doll cutouts. The concept of \"character development\" is taken to the extreme lower depths of creativity as our hero Richard repeatedly \"runs his fingers through his hair\" until I was ready to scream at him to stop the idiotic behavior. (Ohhhh, the use of \"behavioral quirks\" though! Yes! It's necessary so the hero's friends could identify him later by this annoying behavioral quirk.)Character development is the worst I've ever read.The dialogue is horrendously bad, and holds the dubious distinction of being the WORST I've ever read.The ridiculous plot is so bad it's almost the worst I've ever read (The House of Doors holding the bottom spot). The entire story is replete with the author withholding information that the characters (especially the female sidekick) would have, could have, and SHOULD have told our hero under \"normal\" circumstances. But to do so would cause the story to fall apart. Instead of rethinking and editing the story for a smoother plotline, the author forges ahead and forces the female sidekick to cliche \"bite her knuckles\" and offer various clich&eacute; ways of:Mary gnawed on her knuckle and sniffled \"I... I just can't tell you Richard.\"::shrieks::God it's bad. It's cliche hell.And then we come to the end of the story where our cardboard hero finds himself mercilessly tortured by sadists with maximum magical torture devices. And, naturally he falls in love with his tormentor. (Oh, he'll do ANYTHING for her love!)About this time, I began to puke onto my copy of this book.Apparently, the author had come across information regarding hostages occasionally falling in love with their kidnappers, and stupidly applied that psychological abnormality to someone who's being TORTURED. His lack of research on THAT subject leads to the idiotic ending.The final revelation as to the nature of the Sword of Truth and it's purpose, and the nature of the female sidekick, reveals even MORE clich&eacute;s, as if we had an insatiable appetite for them.Apparently, the author had a warehouse full of clich&eacute;s and decided to package them up in this story to get the inventory down.I had to force myself to finish this horrendously bad book.If you're looking for a few ideas for use in a gaming world, you'll find a couple interesting ideas that could be further developed, but if you are looking for a decent story, this isn't worth your time, let alone your hard earned money.This book sucks in all ways, from all angles, from start to finish, and I was personally furious that Mariam Zimmer Bradley gave a review (that encouraged me to purchase this piece of crap) that said \"I honestly believe this will take the world like J. R. Tolkein\" or something to that effect.Yeah, right.Believe ME... this story, and the writing, is terrible.- Alleyrat This is the first book of a series. I've never cared for Fantasy before, but I was hooked from page one. Goodkind is a master storyteller. The plot and characters are highly imaginative and lots of fun, a real page-turner, hard to put down. I highly recommend this story to those who enjoy both high adventure and deeper thoughts. Well, my boyfriend got me reading this series, and it was amazing that he was able to, seeing as though I have never liked fantasy. But, I gave it a try, mostly just to humor him, and I was shocked: I actually enjoyed it! Even though it's well over 800 pages and is very slow in some parts (hence the 4 stars, not 5), the overall story more than makes up for it. The love story between Richard the Seeker and Kahlan the Mother Confessor is a beautiful one. And the main villain plot was interesting, though I think it could have been more climactic. I highly recommend that anyone (excluding maybe younger readers) read this series, even if they're not into fantasy. Hey, I wasn't, but I am now. Seriously, you will not be disappointed. Wizard's First Rule (by Terry Goodkind) is absolutely one of the best books I've read in a long time!! I purchased the book in audio version because I have a very long commute. The book kept me well entertained and my mind off the traffic. The world that Goodkind creates is rich and creative. The narrator's (Sam Tsoutsouvas) voice is deep and seems to fit the story well. His voice is soothing, but not boring -- it's puts me in the mind of my Grandfather. I'll continue onto the next books and I can't wait!!FYI: I wish they would have kept the same narrator for the other versions -- but they didn't :( I'm giving this book four stars because I ENJOYED it, even though the enjoyment is a sort of pleasure I'm not proud of. Most of the criticisms in the negative reviews are true. This certainly isn't The Lord of the Rings. I can't say that it's any worse then Robert Jordan. Although one should note that Goodkind seems to have copied a lot of Jordan's ideas, one should also note that Jordan copied stuff from fantasy genre books before him. So who can say that this is less original than Jodan? At least Goodkind seems to have finished his series. I gave up on Jordan after book 6 or 7 (forget which) when it seemed like he had no intention of ever finishing the series; and I was right, Jordan died before he finished the series.I liked the sado-masochism stuff. Kind of. Do all fantasy writers secretly want to be dominated by women?The writing is very simplistic and I often feel like Goodkind is talking down to me as if I'm a 12-year-old child. It feels like Goodkind has tried to repackage Atlas Shrugged for precocious middle school students.One should also ignore the author's ramblings in which he gets upset that the world considers his book derivative fantasy genre instead of Great Literature. In this case, the world is right and the author is wrong. The author should just be happy that he's making a lot of money while entertaining a lot of readers.But in the end, Goodkind has created a book where you want to keep turning the pages in order to find out what happens. I can't ask for more from escapist fiction. Enjoy it for what it is instead of complaining about what it's not. I'm currently most of the way through the second book, which is better than this one. This is a book of good taste and brilliant wording. I love this book so much that I started telling people that my book was eating me due to the fact that it is so good i dont want to put it down. I find myself alternating between the book and reality as if the book was a reality of its own. This is a book of great poportions and should be read by all. MY FAVORITE book EVER... At first my favorite book was in the eyes of a dragon by steven king...then someone let me borrow this one and I must say it is the BEST fantasy book ever. If you like fantasy this is a MUST READ. It just amazes me where he gets his imagination from. I have read the whole series and can not wait for the next book to come out. You know what, guys? Some of you just take literature far too seriously. I mean, it's just a book for God's sake! Sheesh! The following is a review of the book as well as a review of the reviewers.First, the book. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I'm a big fantasy fan, and I thought this was a worth entry into the genre. Sure, some of the scenes were a little silly. Some were gory. Some were intense. And some were really graphic. But a book this big and involving was never meant to be read by twelve-year-olds. You're an adult, you should be able to handle it. If you can't, no one's forcing you to continue. Take the book back to the library, sell it at a used book store. Whatever.Anyway, I liked it. The writing is such that the reader really begins to feel for the characters. I still get the shivers whenever I read about Richard's capture and subsequent torture. And the reader really cheers when Kahlan snaps and kills the bad guys with her magic. Like I said, a worthy entry into the genre.Now, the review of the reviewers. What the hell is up with you guys? Mostly, the folks that enjoyed the book are very good-natured. They liked the book, and they basically just wanted to say their piece and leave. The biggest complaint from the book-haters has been the bad grammar in the reviews. Well folks, nobody's perfect, all right? One review by A Reader (didn't want to leave your name, huh?) said that everybody's grammar was terrible. Well, pal, you know what? When you're using the possessive, the word YOU'RE is spelled just like that, not YOUR. And English is capitalized, too.My whole point is that you should all lighten up. If you liked the book, that's great, but if you didn't, don't call us morons. Just say &quot;I didn't like the book. End of story.&quot; Learn to handle your stress in healthier ways. Wizard's First Rule is a remarkable book. It's probably the only book in the series that should've been written (Faith of the Fallen is a possible exception, although with it begins Goodkind's fall into explicit, philosophical moralizing). I love Richard and Kahlan. As archetypal heroes they are perhaps the most numinous I've encountered in high fantasy. I just wish they'd been treated more respectfully. The tortures they've been made to endure have been difficult for me to bear (not only narratively, but also literarily [Wizard's First Rule aside]). I would rather he had written a trilogy than a... meandering hendecalogy.In all, the series reminds of many I've seen on T.V. Shows like: Alias, Lost, Heroes. Each had great first seasons, but from there descended agonizingly into Soap Opera. It is appropriate, then, that the final insult has been delivered to the Sword of Truth Series and there is now a Legend of the Seeker T.V. show. Apparently Goodkind was excited about this (judging by the press blurbs on his website), but I wonder if he still is. I watched the first two episodes on Hulu and find it difficult to believe that such a great vision could be so handily slaughtered (it's as if they were handled by an anti-seeker, a master of destroying noble visions). But then, I've seen the many attempts at Dune, so I don't know why I was surprised. I get the sense, from the books, that Richard is in or nearly in his 30's. That before meeting Kahlan he was already a mature, quiet man, whose slightly older brother was the political leader of the region. In the series, however, he is cast as a muscle-bound 21 year old with a disproportionately small, immature face. In the book Zedd had been teaching Richard, covertly, his entire life. In the Show, Zedd was just a \"crazy old man that talks to chickens\". Kahlan is played by an actress without facial musculature necessary to express true depth of emotion or judgement. (I only speak of the T.V. Show to give a second example of the sort of betrayal the original vision has endured.)I like the philosophy that Goodkind presents... within reason :) Having read Ayn Rand long before I picked up his books, I recognized immediately the sense of life he was portraying. But he falls into many of the same errors as she did. Not the least of which is shallow, unbelievable depictions of the \"other side\". I admit, the anti-life philosophy can be comical when stripped of its dressings and custumes. It can also be depressing to realize how many people really \"live by\", in essence, the abdication of the Self. But I don't think the sanctity of life is truly expressed by simplifying beyond recognition the complexities of the ways we fall into error and the difficulties we face in prising right from wrong. One dimensional representations of man cannot provide the necessary contrast for a true appreciation of the great achievement that is a truly moral life.In summary, the trajectory of this series of books is as follows: what started as an archetypal human struggle against darkness has ended in the sado-masochistic catharsis of an author. Does Goodkind enjoy torturing the soul-personified with his agiel-pen? I don't know, but many times I've had to put my inner hero in'an inner box to protect him from this series' relentless cruelty.-Jerome Meyers This book kept me up all hours of the night! It was put togeather so well that I read it twice befor I moved on to the second one. I have never seen a book with char. develpoment as good as this. I reccomend this book to every one, once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down. This book gets more then 5 stars i give it 10!!!! This is the best fantasy book that I have read to date. I used to read the Shannara books and think that they were the greatest (still the second best fantasy series), but Goodkind's world is entrapping. The way that Goodkind brings the characters to life is remarkable, and the plot keeps you turning the pages. If you've read Harry Potter and liked it, then you'll love this book. It's rich fabric is extremly more involving and it's characters are more real. The best start to a fantasy series that I have read so far. I loved, loved, loved this book. It is classic fantasy full of magic swords, magic animals and magic characters. The story is complex but not confusing. I couldn't put it down. I'm kicking myself for not reading this when it came out in the 90's - but as with all good books, age has not diminished it. Wizard's First Rule is a classsic good versus evil morality story. In true sci-fi form, a &quot;good&quot; person is enlisted in the service of overthrowing an evil emperor. In this case, Richard (the good guy) does not have any clue about things magical (or even the existence of magic). Nonetheless, he is forced to face his destiny with the help of colorful people who are so well developed you cannot help but feel that they are your friends too. Likewise, the evil forces are well drawn out, and make you detest them and fear for our hero. You will enjoy this book, as well as the sequels. Be warned, this book has a lot of thoroughly described violence in it. If you enjoy the current crop of shock films, this won't be a problem. More conservative readers will find the book gratuitous.Goodkind borrows a handful of cliches and binds them together into a linear plot line. The story begins with a problem, and works towards the improbable solution. There is a requisite allusion to the sequel. Like Star Wars, the book is hardly thought provoking, but entertaining. Given his motivations, Goodkind would certainly disagree.Goodkind introduces a number of Skeptic, Athiest, and Objectivist philosophical themes throughout his series that will appeal to some and offend others. If you're \"on the fence\" with your religion and you like fantasy, it's worth reading just to introduce further topics for research. 20-something males positively love this stuff. On his web site, Goodkind clearly states that his first objective as a writer isn't to entertain, but to pass on his message in an easily digestible medium. Consider his work the modern equivalent of morality plays, and you'll find things to appreciate.The mediocre writing would be quite acceptable if Terry didn't arrogantly state on his web site that \"writers are born, not made\" and that he eschews the publishing industry's methods for acquiring, vetting, and editing work. I found it cheapened the books' message, especially considering the modesty of the main characters. His press releases and responses to fan questions are a real turn off. Read the books before getting to know the author. I am a fairly new reader, of only six months, in that time I have plunged into every fantasy book I can get my hands on and by far this book has brought me into like none other. I have read all the complaints about \"Wizard's First rule\" about using magic to escape, to win fights at the last second,and being too unrealistic, yada, yada, yada. Well i dont read books to read about how real it is, if i wanted to do that i would just buy a history book and not a fantasy. The book is truly great, with a fantastic story and great characters. I felt for all the characters, even when it did not involve richard (who is one of my favorite's I've ever read about), they all seemed to have a purpose and a great personality to them. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I'm very happy to see Wizard's First Rule available for Kindle. This book is a real favorite of mine. The characters of Richard and Kahlan immediately caught my interest, and I followed their adventures through the 11 book Sword of Truth series.Many contemporary authors tell stories that reflect an ambiguous take on evil. While they can be entertaining, I found it refreshing to see the heroes distinguish between good and evil, delving into what each consists of.But more importantly, I had a lot of fun just taking in the story. For me, Goodkind's first novel more than makes up for a few awkward turns of phrase with its colorful characters, and page-turning plot. This is good old-fashioned edge of your seat storytelling tackled with enthusiasm and energy.I expect that Kindle and Goodkind will gain more fans from this arrangement. As millions have already found out, The Sword of Truth Series is not just a book series, but rather a creative world outside our own. I've read many classics in my lifetime and never have I been so fortunate to come across something so creative, imaginative, spell binding and emotional. I came upon this series purely by fate. For the longest time when I was younger, my sister tried to get me to read this book. I refused because I preferred more \"realistic\" literature. Finally, after considerable persistence by my sister I gave in reluctantly to appease her. Of course, the conditions were set by her.. \" Let me read you the first two chapters and if you don't like it..then I'll stop\"... Thinking this was a quick way out, I accepted. She started reading. It wasn't long before she just suddenly stopped. Confused, I asked her why she was stopping. Sure enough, it was the end of the two chapters. I must admit I was almost insulted that she stopped. I begged her to continue on. By chapter 2 I was already hooked on this book like a drug. Since then, I've read the whole series. I've given NUMEROUS people the same challenge. I've been loaning out my first book, and buying more of it and giving it to my customers at work! This series is so amazing, I want to share it with the world! So, in closing.. I give you this same challenge... Read the first two chapters... if you don't like it.. you can stop. Just keep in mind when you get hooked on this series, you WILL lose sleep, you WILL go to bed later, your time will NOT be bored if you have one of these books with you. You will laugh, cry, get angry and refluff your pillow, you will hope, you will talk about this everywhere you go.. you will think about it every waking moment. You will use this series as an escape from this world. You will do and be a lot of things, however you will not be disappointed. I promise! I think that sometimes a book sells well because it came along at the right place at the right time with the right cover art. That must be the case with Wizard's First Rule, because nothing inside justifies it's apparently immense popularity. I'm not saying it was trash, just that anyone who has read more than 5 or so fantasy novels will keep having deja vu, and that more experienced readers will feel patronized by the overly-simplified style.As other reviewers have pointed out before me, the writing is undersophisticated. I would guess the appropriate reading level to be 13 years old, which is actually inappropriate if you assume that the average scifi/fantasy reader is probably quite a bit older than that. If the awkward sentences were supposed to be from the point of view of a kid, then perhaps I could understand, but the hero is a full-grown adult.Even more than the bad dialog and prose, the author seems to have hit every cliche in the genre. The love interest established in the first chapter, starting on a quest to stop an evil lord with a ragtag band that somehow includes a wizard, the enchanted sword, the sorceress they meet along the way who speaks in riddles. A villian named Darken Rahl (Star Wars, anyone?) I could go on, but if this sounds familiar so far, you've had enough to get the picture.Yes, Goodkind has a few smatterings of original ideas, but they're not enough to pull the book off. I only made myself finish it because based on this series' success, I kept hoping that it would get better, and because I have a rule that if it's worth starting, it's worth finishing...but now I'm not so sure.Bottom line: if you're new to fantasy, and/or under 13, this book will be just your speed. it is more like a 3.5 stars, but the first law itself is so right and amuzing, that i had to round it up instead of down.becuse this is a very not good book, which is only saved by the concept of trying to trick your enemy instead of stubbing him with a random sharp piece of metal. I liked this book overall. The plot was your pretty standard fantasy fare, but there were enough interesting wrinkles to keep me engrossed. Some other reviewers have commented on the wordy or repetitive nature of the book; I did not find that to be the case. Rather, unlike other novels which cover a lot of ground, and jump around from character to character, this one stays with a scene for a long, long time and slowly builds until that scene concludes and then the next scene is begun. So if you prefer your action fast and furious, with lots of threads simultaneously interweaving, then this is probably not the book for you. Instead you will stay with the same characters as they slowly work their way through a particular part of the story (Westlands, Boundary, Mud People. Agaden Reach, Tamarang, People's Palace pretty much it for 800 pages); I could see that being tedious for some readers who want things to move along faster, it was not so much for me, although I would agree the part with the Mud People started to drag, and the graphic scenes with the Mord-Sith did feel gratuitous so that part could have been trimmed to take some of the brutality out. But overall an enjoyable ride. This book is excellent, there is never a dull moment, it's written well and it's not too technical. There arn't hundred of different characters to remember or complicated alliances, cryptic magical nonsense, or anything like that. So even if you're not used to reading fantasy you can follow what's going on. Unlike Robert Jordan whose books become overly involved to the point where you don't know what's going on anymore unless of course you're used to reading books like that. They do have a lot of reference to magic of course, but it's pretty basic, and when they backtrack and mention history it's also not complicated so when they reference it again as it relates to the present you kinda go \"Oh yeah, I remember that, now it makes sense\" This book was great. I couldn't put it down. I swear I broke out in a sympathetic sweat as the character traversed rough terrain and overcame obstacles. This is one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to see the rest of the series on the Kindle. I literally just finished WIZARD'S FIRST RULE five minutes ago and here I am, about to order the second one. That's how good it is. It's really worth the read. If you are the type that gets scared easily, be warned: it does get a little bloody, but not too much. That's why I give WIZARD'S FIRST RULE four stars instead of five.Be careful of the gars and of when the Seeker, Rahl, or a Mord-Sith kills - it made me uncomfortable, but no story would be good if it didn't have the &quot;bad guy&quot; and all of his demons. And believe me - this book is GOOD!! Convinced by online critics that Wizard's First Rule was horrific, I never gave Wizard's First Rule a chance in the past; Terry Goodkind's books were crossed off my list without even batting an eye.One of the greatest virtues I have learned later on in life is not to pass judgement on someone's work based on other critics opinions. Donning this mindless logic is an easy trap to fall into; Fooling myself that I had the cognitive ability all great critics do because I apered their words.Terry Goodkind is dyslexic, yet he was able to overcome his handicapp and become a bestselling novelist. Dyslexia brings out the worst and best in people, some give in an quit others are tenacious pitbulls that someone find a way to be successful. Coming from a depressing dyslexic background myself, I can identify with Goodkinds hardship; thus when I was searching for famous dsylexics and stumbled across Goodkind I decided to give his novel a chance.Openings are critical to my judgement of a book; Goodkinds opening to this book is unorthodox and is a refreshing change to the action laden openings all too common in fantasy novels. Subtle and almost impallible, his opening description of a basalm fir ebbs my curiousity. Spoiled I become in Goodkinds lavishly written prose; my thirst for articulate descriptions is sated immediately.Unorthodox writing styles can either make or break a novel, Goodkinds unorthox prose kept my interest all through this book. Some people cringe at the grammatical flaws when they read something unorthodox while others are able to appreciate it's artistic splendor.Creativity is the hallmark sign of a Dyslexic; Undoubtedly, Goodkind is endowed with a flair for creativity other authors so desperately wish they had. I read through it, hearing all the good reviews, and I could see some elements that were true fantasy archetypes.However, I felt bludgeoned by a couple things that took me completely out of my immersion. The first was the blatantly evil, blatantly Communist regime.The second was the society of Sado-masochists. I don't see an entire society based on this core concept as one that will last long.These elements, to me, were written in a way that lacked any sense of subtlety. The reader was not tasked with thinking about these elements in this book.I haven't read any more in this series and I won't be re-reading this one any time soon (if ever). Others may find this book to your taste, but not everyone is going to enjoy it. Do NOT buy this, or any other of Goodkind's books. Here's why:Most of the action sequences happen for no reason other than to have something happen. I mean, in his interviews Goodkind whines and complains that his books are not fantasy even though, give it up man, they are. There's one part in this book towards the end where all of a sudden a dragon comes into play. WHile you are reading this you're thinking, 'why am i reading this?' It's like even though he protests that his novels are NOT of the fantasy genre, he takes the stereotypical elements and puts them in his book. Oh, everything accept elves and dwarves and the like. That, it seems, it too below him.What is really annoying is that after most of his characters meet each other, within moments they are sharing their life stories and comforting each other like they were best friends for life. I don't know about you but it takes me at least more than a few hours of knowing someone before i open up and tell them just about everyhting about me.His main character Richard (wow, how creative on the name front, huh?) runs his hand through his hair on just about every page (check for yourself if you don't believe me) and should be friggin bald by like the third chapter. Kahlan, the other main character, is supposed to be this tough as nails heroine from way arcoss the other side of the UNCROSSABLE boundary. She crosses the boundary, and after meeting Richard and deciding they need to get back through the boundary, they actually look for help in crossing the boundary as if she didn't spend the first part of the book telling him how she crossed and how dangerous it is. Then, after they begin to cross the boundary, friggin Kahlan cries, has tears in her eyes, wipes at her tears, has tears swelling/stinging her eyes and so on and clutches to Richard through the whole process as if she has never even been there! I don't even feel like going it because of how ridiculous the story becomes.There are so many holes in this story that you shouldn't even bother 'renting' it from your library. Goodkind uses commas in his sentences like they are going out of style and puts adverb after adverb in his sentences even more so - a BIG wiriting no no. WHat gets me even more is that he likes to string them to the end of dialogue tags; \"Richard said angrily\", \"Kahlan whispered quietly\", Chase said abgrily\". OMG how was it that he ever even got his book published? You know what? I think that someone saw his 400,000 word manuscript and thought \"hey man, we can get a lot of books out of him so let's do it\" then without even having an editor look at the thing sent it into print.There are actually books written bad on purpose for aspiring writers to read so they can see what NOT to do and Goodkind's books actually resemble them very much. His books are a miracle, alright. It's a miracle they ever got published. Whatever you do, don't waste your money. You'll have a better time re-reading one of you favorite books reguardless of how many times you've already read it.Oh and by the way, this book has a nice BIG SECRET ending that sickens the reader when they get to it. I think Goodkind watched Star Wars one too many times while writing this book because that tired old \"Luke, i am your father\" scene is actually used in his book! HA! HA! HA! That's supposed to be the big twist/spin/surprise of this novel. It sure did that to me when i read it, only it was my stomach that twisted/spun/surprised me when i retasted my lunch. BLAGG to this book, most definately. I learned of these books by watching the television show &#34;Legend of the Seeker&#34;. Whenever presented with the opportunity to read the books over watching the movie or show I of course say &#34;YES&#34; because the books are 90% of the time better. I expected that many things would be different and must say I am pleased with the book overall. However, the author is repetitive in odd places. When things don't need to be repeated, they are repeated multiple times. All-in-all the story is captivating, it just seems to be written for a younger audience I suppose. I just figured I'd share -- I tried five or six times to try and read this book because it has gotten such good reviews. However, the storyline and characters are atrocious. Clue 1: Richard's evil politician brother early on delivers a diatribe against the evils of fire and how they have to strive against it, and the people listening to him don't think he sounds like a dork, railing against fire? give me a break. Clue 2. After the aforementioned speech, the brother goes over and [touches] Richard's new woman friend Kahlan upon being introduced to her, and while Richard and Kahlan are naturally surprised, their reactions are very inauthentic, and the narration does not bother to point out how ridiculous it is for the brother to come over and [touch] a woman he's never met right in front of his brother. Clue 3: Richard, who is not the adventuring sort, gets the Sword of Truth; he and the woman Kahlan meet up with some ranger friend of Richard's, who despite knowing that Richard is not the adventuring sort, listens to Richard explain how he must go on a quest for about 2 minutes and then very solemnly declares that he will protect them -- as corny as it gets. Other clues -- there's very little originality in the book. Maybe if it had an original concept or magic this would redeem it, but it doesn't. Even the bad guy Darken Rahl has a very derivative name. It was a great book to listen to. Even when I could only listen to and from work each day. suspence full and wonderful. First and foremost, this book was wonderful! Ignore all the silly nit-picky negative reviews. If you like a good fantasy novel with great character development that doesn't pull any punches, then this is the story for you.It had been at least 7 years since I had really picked up a good book. I had gotten a bit burnt out on the WoT series, and I just couldn't make myself get that same spark I used to get when I picked up a new book. But after 100 pages of this, I couldn't out it down. I poured through it for days until I finally finished it. Now I'm on to book 2!I highly recommend this book for any fantasy lovers out there. WIZARD'S FIRST RULE, SWORD OF TRUTH BOOK 1BY TERRY GOODKIND: While Goodkind's first book in his now complete 11-book Sword of Truth series begins with an eerie thorn bush that sends its thorns burrowing beneath your skin as if they were alive which immediately grabs the reader's attention and interest, Wizard's First Rule is a classic first epic fantasy novel that sets the stage for a great series.Richard Cypher is your classic, innocent, ordinary guy who has grown up in a simple family with a relatively simple life. His mother died when he was younger, but his father has supported him and his brother since then. Early on, the reader learns that his father has died mysteriously, to the point where he may have been murdered. Then he meets a woman, Kahlan, fleeing for her life from four men who he helps her to kill. The woman is very beautiful and Richard is immediately smitten with her. When Kahlan meets Richard's good old friend, Zedd, there is a strange connection between them, as if they know who and what each of them are.It is then that the story begins to unfold. Zedd is a powerful wizard who has been in hiding for some time. Kahlan is what is known as a Confessor, a woman with the ability to \"touch\" someone and make them become obsessed with the Confessor and will do whatever they are told. And then the decision is made by Zedd that Richard Cypher is to be the Seeker and bearer of the mighty Sword of Truth. There is an evil man in the far east, Darken Rahl who is taking over, killing many, and looking to control all the known world. It is up to Richard, with the help of Kahlan and Zedd, too stop him.From this description, Wizard's First Rule seems like any ordinary fantasy series, where Richard is a Frodo-type or a Rand-type from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. And yet there is a startling harshness to this series, it is a gruesome world, there is sex and lust, unlike that of Jordan's or Tolkien's worlds. It shocks the reader, but keeps them reading, wanting to know what will happen next.[...] I had heard of the Legend of the Seeker spin off and wanted to see where it stemmed from so I tried this book. This is my first read of a Terry Goodkind book and I really enjoyed it. The characters may seem familiar and the story a bit formulaic but it is excellently crafted with twists and cliffhangers throughout to keep you interested.The book made me desire to know what was going to happen next and this made it very difficult to put down which is the real measure of a book. My only criticism is the level of romance in the book (too much for a macho guy like me!) and the 'love conquers all' theme was a bit over the top sometimes but that's down to personal taste.The fights were brutal, exciting and well written. Several times you read a character doing something and you feel like fist punching the air and saying 'Hell no He did not just do that!' The constant struggle and vulnerability of the characters keeps you cheering for them too.Worth a look! I read this book when it was first published and thought that it was worth the read (then again, there's not much of any genre I won't read, and I was only a teenager at the time). My problem now is that since the death of Robert Jordan, I took it upon myself to actually try and slog through the Wheel of Time Series for the first time, and the similarities between this book and his series are just too \"coincidental\". I've read arrogant interviews with Terry Goodkind where he proclaims he has changed the genre and his books are unlike any other, but now I wonder how he had the audacity to actually voice that opinion. (Though many of the similarities are also included in his later books of the series.) Goodkind's \"banelings\" are remarkably similar to Jordan's \"Darkfriends\", the Keeper is Jordan's \"Dark One\", and Richard (the innocent woodsman), like Jordan's Rand (the innocent sheepherder), is usually marked by his sword. SPOILER: The paternal parentage of both boys also come into question in the books. There are many more throughout the whole series, too many for comfort. I'm not sure if anyone else has commented on this, I didn't read all 1300 reviews. Just throwing it out there. Other than that, the first 5 books in the series aren't so bad that I wouldn't read them. True, they are very cheesy and reminiscent of a bad romance novel, but like a really bad horror movie: its so bad, its good. Goodkind's first book in the sword of truth series sets the standard. His novel ideas set in Richard Cypher's world of fantasy keep the reader turning pages. Amongst its peers in the world of Science Fiction and Fantasy literature, Wizard's First Rule is a cut above the rest. Wizards First Rule was an easy, enjoyable read; the type of novel to peruse in front of a fire on a cold day. Each character played a specific, defined role and, in some aspects, read like a script. The real star of the novel was the plotline. Still, it was a fun read and I would recommend the book."

         "This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \"wordy\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it! I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella. Amazing depiction of characters that stick with you and linger even after finishing. The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights?\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm not sure how I got through school without reading it and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed it as much in my student days. However, it truly is a wonderful peek into human nature at its worst and at its best. I too am one of those high school kids that was forced to read the book freshman year. But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book. I am not an avid reader but this one was awesome. I love the fact that I can download classic pieces of literature for free on my phone. I don't own a Kindle and only read on my phone when I've forgotten a hard copy of a book. The pages are crisp and clear and I can bookmark easily. To say Great Expectation is \"Classic\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired. I highly recommend Great Expectations and eagerly look forward to A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist.Dawn Kurtz author ofSecret of the Mexican Doll I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband.

This book is so boring, I have to read it for my Honors Preparation English Liturature and Writing Class. It is really difficult to understand also. Understood classic by others, but it bored me. Then again, I had to read this for school. I found it to lack in a real plot. I am a fan of Charles Dickens but this one was not good. Great Expectations reveals the life of an orphan, Pip, who is alone in a desolate world even though he lives with his sister. Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life. This novel, in all its intensity is filled with details that make reading enjoyable and very realistic. Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life. This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example, the meeting with the convict in the churchyard is where the action starts to pick up. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics. Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you of its quintessential nature, but hopefully it will open your mind to possibly the greatest novel of all time. I appreciate this edition for its introduction (which is interesting for literature buffs and beneficial for serious students/readers), for the end notes (which are definitely helpful in explaining Victorian allusions and other references for readers who have little or no background or experience with such), for the inclusion of the original ending (which provokes a variety of options for discussion and examination), for the discussion questions, and for the presentation (easy to read pages). My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story). I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \"great expectations\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \"sponsor\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work. I did not like this book. I was unable to finish it. It started off slow and there was nothing about it that was \"great.\" Over the last few years, every other book I've read has been Dickens. This is, so far, my favorite. It is an absolutely brilliantly woven tale. Dickens was remarkably talented at creating characters that captured the essence of what makes us human to the point that he was able to create characters who are completely real, and might be found walking amung us today. If you are new to Dickens, this would be a great place to start. I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless. Pages are all different size and roughly cut. A bit rubbish, really. This is not a reflection on the narative, which of course is well reviewed in general. Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \"Great Expectations\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \"learns his lesson\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone. I've always adored Dickens, and even read eight of his novels for a class in undergraduate school. I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \"castle\" and the \"ancient\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile. This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter. Some chapters start in the middle of disks or even in the middle of tracks. My 7th graders love to listen to it, so it has been worth the aggravation of trying to find which chapter is where. I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless. Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \"classic\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \"Great Expectations\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . . This is a wonderful opportunity to read the classics, this book by Dickens gives us an insight in the life of the under privileged in older times. the way Kindle works is great because it has a built in dictionary which becomes very helpful. In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him? A convict wants to give all his money to Pip because he scared him so much he got him to do what he wanted? I could go on some more, but I'm bored, 3 stars for the writing. It left me wanting more. This was a very beautifully written love story. I found the attraction between Estella and Finn was more true and captivating then Romeo &amp;Juliet. My objective is to read as many of the classic books as possible. I found this book to be very hard to put down and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. A pleasure to read. I am really enjoying it To be cliched, it is a classic and I would reccomend it to anyone. Great characters, some mystery, humour and emotion. this story is timeless. Could have been a Greek Tragedy. The image of ms backhand, waiting... Moves me. Excellent work! The classic story we've known, loved, and shared with our children.However the page size of this edition is so small, it makes the book difficult to read and overly thick.Given the choice, I'd pick a version with a more conventional size. Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that. I down loaded \"Great Expectations\" after hearing some friends talk about it. This electronic translation was ALMOST perfect but the few mess ups were tolerable (and distinguishable). I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to explore a well written piece of classic literature. This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-) This is a true classic that everyone should read at least once in their lives. I loved it and will read it again and again! This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \"I'm rich and you're not,\" and \"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring. Who knew that a book written almost 150 years ago could be so great? Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \"Mrs. Joe\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \"rampages\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Some audio books are unlistenable, with inept hammy actors mucking up the text. I recently had that experience with one of my favorite books, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which was so appallingly read by a horrible ham, I would have thrown the CDs out the car window if they hadn't belonged to my local library.This GREAT EXPECTATIONS is probably the best \"book on CD\" I've ever heard. Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature. This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm. The book \"The Great Expectations\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \"turn around\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end. Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read. Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book Great Expectations follows Pip's life goes from childhood to adulthood with many twists and turns. Some predictable others unexpected. Many hours of good reading. I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books! I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \"Great Expectations\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\"Great Expectations\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \"Great Expectations\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \"Great Expectations\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \"Great Expectations\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \"Hard Times\" and let those who want more seek out \"Great Expectations\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here. This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book. I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class. One of my favorite books of all time. A love story with a twist and very well conceived but the author. Great book.. This is a great classic. One of my favorite books by Dickens.A book everyone should read at least once....(though you will probably read it more than once!!!!) I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+ This book was almost as good as A Tale of Two Cities (I read the two Back to Back.) It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes. A good classic read. This is a priceless piece of history that reads excellently on my Droid device. This book has a tale that never gets old. It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \"having already been read\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition. Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages. I recently reread this wonderful classic and was mesmerized by it all over again - a must read for anyone who has not read this book. What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic. Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere. This book is another classic, telling the great story of a once simple orphan boy named Pip. I greatly enjoyed this book, with Charles Dickens' enticing use of imagery, it is sure to keep anyone reading. This book could make one cry, and smile. And to me, for it to cause any sort of such emotion, it has to be a truly lovely book to read. If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \"Great Expectations.\" When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+ There really aren't words for this book. The characters were as lifelike as possible, the plot was intreeging, and the writing was supperb. I am only 12, but I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read. Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are. This is often listed as a reading requirement for college and high school classes alike, I read it in college. But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good. But even the best of author's can have a mess-up every now and then and \"Great Expectations\" is certainly not one that I would recommend reading. When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \"intellectual\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century. This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slow, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example the meeting with the convict in the churchyard. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics. Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \"grown-ups\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day. In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb. Great story written by a great author! No complaints!The way he described the boy's thoughts, the way he described the environment, etc, so attracting.BTW, there are indeed pictures in the book. Great Expectations Saw the movie and loved it so figured the book had to be better.I wanted to read it for years Great Expectations was not that great of a novel. I found it to be dull and a bit on the boring side. Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal! I had a chance to see the film several times. I really loved it. It is a bitter-sweet love-story of a boy with deep feelings. It is not an easy-to-read book, not everyone will like it. It is much better, than the film I also like. Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it. (I've read an abridged version four or five times!) OK. I like reading and everything but when I read at the begining of this school year, I was bored out of my mind through the whole book. I found absolutly no point to this book I got into reading a lot this past fall and haven't been able to stop. I read in a couple of different series one of the main characters mention reading a few old books from Great Britain. I decided to read them to see what I was missing out on. I love this book. I never care for endings... that means I have to find a new book!!! LOL but this has up, downs, twists and turns; I am so glad I took the time to read it. Any one with a passion for literature (and those who don't) should read Great Expectations. Not only is the story itself wonderful, but Dickin's underlying messages of about life and circumstances that lead people to their destinies are amazing. While a bit wordy at times, the style is superb and outlives the era to speak to modern people as well as it did one hundred years ago. Please, don't let your view of Dickins be &quot;old&quot;! This book is as relevent today as it was when first published. Read it today! Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises.

Enjoyed it as a youth but as an adult, it had a more realistic effect on me. I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \"must read\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece. I was an avid reader, but somehow things changed in my life, but thanks to my Kindle I am getting back to reading. With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \"classics\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read. Great Expectationsby Charles Dickens; I know that had I been required to read this book for 9th grade English, I'm pretty sure that I would have hated it. As it was it took me better than a month to get through the first half of the story... and then I raced through the second half in a couple of days on my Christmas Kindle. A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work. Lots of interesting examinations of British class separation and discrimination, expectations, and dry humor. Looking forward to more by Dickens. Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written. I remember really liking this book the first time I read it. The second go around, not so much. Oliver Twist is a much better Dickens novel. i was first introduced to this book through the summer reading required at my school. I wrote ten pages about the story of Pip's journey through British life and how he changed as a person....It was not a happy journey for me, i just want that out in the open. I had to pore over endless details from a book that was confusing enough to read anyways. I do not recommend this book, especially if your looking for a cheap thrill...there is none. I think that if you sequestered enough polygamy to get you through Kenneth Branaugh's Hamlet, then maybe MAYBE, you can get through this boring, endless, fairytale of a novel. Thank you, and good night. Love it! Still love it and will continue to love this timeless story. Now i am sharing it with my kids. I loved this book. However unlike others, this one keeps things somber. It is not some frilly romance novel but a little more realistic with many twists and turns. The classics are always good to re-visit, this is one of Dickens best. There are always subtleties missed at the first reading For the price a very sweet deal. have had it for 2 months now and no problems. would buy again from this company This classic was all I thought it would be & more. Descriptions wonderful. Characters stay with you. Dickens moves a story along in his own unique way.GKE Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed! Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \"brought up by hand\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \"friend\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \"Great Expectations\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \"Great Expectations,\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \"a man in waiting\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \"Great Expectations,\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \"Great Expectations\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \"Great Expectations\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \"I saw no parting from her.\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \"Great Expectations\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \"Great Expectations\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip. This book could have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length novel it lacks both and entertaining plot and characters that one can truly empathize with. Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \"Bildungsroman\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \"Nicholas Nickleby\",\"David Copperfield\" and \"Great Expectations\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \"David Copperfield\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \"Great Expectations\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\"Great Expectations\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \"oncommon\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \"by hand\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \"marry her by hand\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \"David Copperfield\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \"David Copperfield\" thoroughly before writing \"Great Expectations\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \"Great Expectations\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \"common\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \"old convict\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \"Great Expectations\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft. I got a few classics for the kindle app, can't go wrong with ant classics in my opinion! Better yet, they were free!!!!! Reaching deep into himself, Dickens created this novel of moral exploration, high comedy, and page-turning narrative power. Pip, an orphan raised by his bullying siter and her sweet-naured blacksmith husband, discovers one day that he has a mysterious benefactor. The good-hearted Pip suddenly has &quot;great expectations&quot; of his life and begins to reject spiritual values for materialistic ones. Depspite his financial windfall, things don't go well for Pip. Estella, the beautiful but haughty young woman he loves, coldheartedly tortures him. And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip. Great Expectations represents one of Dicken's greatest triumphs. It manages to be both funny and moving. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history. acceptable, ace*, admirable, agreeable, bad, boss*, bully, capital, choice, commendable, congenial, crack*, deluxe, excellent, exceptional, favorable, first-class, first-rate, gnarly, gratifying, great, honorable, marvelous, neat*, nice, pleasing, positive, precious, prime, rad, recherch&eacute;, reputable, satisfactory, satisfying, select, shipshape, sound, spanking, splendid, sterling, stupendous, super, super-eminent, super-excellent, superb, superior, tip-top, up to snuff, valuable, welcome, wonderful, worthy This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\" I had to read this book for my English class and at first it was so boring! It about a young boy named Pip and he is trying to find his true indentity. At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a &quot;gentleman&quot; because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring. I had not read this book since I was at school many years ago. Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are. I would recommend to any one wanting to read some of the old classics. After having a very diffiult time enjoying A Tale of Two Cities, which I found to be unappealing, austere, and excessively verbose, I was prepared to denounce this book as well. However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance. First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated! This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic. To conclude, I belive that the chapters are cycled like story line with many charictors and an entire chapter with Pip talking to himself and talking about his expectations. Thank you for reading my review. Clean good story. Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand. This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free. Had to have it. Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: `Too long, Sir!' `Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to `teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of `reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better. The way the story started just pulls you to know more to know where it is leading. A great book by a great author I enjoyed this edition, I am happy with the endnotes and the inclusion of the original ending. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story. i was first introduced to this book through the summer reading required at my school. I wrote ten pages about the story of Pip's journey through British life and how he changed as a person....It was not a happy journey for me, i just want that out in the open. I had to pore over endless details from a book that was confusing enough to read anyways. I do not recommend this book, especially if your looking for a cheap thrill...there is none. I think that if you sequestered enough polygamy to get you through Kenneth Branaugh's Hamlet, then maybe MAYBE, you can get through this boring, endless, fairytale of a novel. Thank you, and good night. This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \"wordy\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it! What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic. Great book! Very deep reading - life lesson with so much meaning. All members portrayed different characteristics that had a major effect in the life of Pip. Everyone should read before starting life's journey. I have always been an avid reader, always in search for a book that would enlighten and ispire me. Great Expectations by Charles Dickens fulfilled this. It is a compelling story about a young man who through a series of circumstances meets a beautiful yet cold hearted girl named Estella. The book follows him through his adolence an adult years. To me this book still hold very true today. It tells about love and how time may not heal all wounds. And also about how some people are manipulated, as Estalla was, into living out others lives. Excellent book. Great tie in of all the characters and relationships of each to the main character. I preferred the author's original ending. First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated! This came at indicated. I was going to get it for my Ipad but it is for my daughter for High School and so she would need to take it each day to school so I got it at the end of school and it was a great price. This is the classic version of Dickens's masterpiece. It is very nicely done and very enjoyable. From my point of view the price is fair for what you get. It is not a cheap copy from the corner bookstore but also not overpriced. The quality is totally fine and it looks nice . About the story, well you can read that in the other reviews or look for it on the internet. I really enjoyed reading it and would recommend it at any time.Regards,B. Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times. Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book. Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have. A journey of place and time, yes; but above all a journey of heart. Pip's retrospective honesty gave me cause to reflect upon my own errors through the years and ultimately celebrate our shared human capacity to grow in heart and spirit. I am a teacher and tried last year to read and teach this novel but used the original. (6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer. Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb. It is also very easy to read. The plot is well developed and the number of characters and the interaction of subplots is masterful.When a terrified four year old Pip is coerced into bringing an escaped convict food, he sets into motion a chain of events that will determine the direction of his life and explain that of others. Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him. And the lovely Estella, for whom he craves, could she be part of this inheritance? Why is someone grooming him to be a gentleman? Who? All these questions and more are answered as the story unfolds in this powerful work. This book is classic Dickens. It's a winner. It lives up to my expectations. Anyone who loves Dickens will enjoy this book. Again we see a young person growing up on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" become a hero in his own right. Pip learns many things in his journey and comes to terms with the folks who shaped his understanding, even though they are simple folk. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today. Pip is an orphan. His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \"play,\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \"Great Expectations.\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon. This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend. Amazing, classic, and beautifully written. A strange pauper-gone-prince tale where all the threads of fate's loom are intertwined frequently. Amazing! Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime). I enjoyed reading this book in my school days. Its a very great book with a good story.One of the greatest works by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel. How cold you not love this book? It's a classic. The internal struggle Pip goes through and crazy old Miss Havisham are brought to life through the author's mastery of the written word. I love the free books for the Kindle. They greatly expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library as well as allow us to keep a copy as long as we need. Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \"caved in\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \"more acceptable.\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \"happily ever after\" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled \"Great Expectations.\" As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!! Great Expectations was not that great of a novel. I found it to be dull and a bit on the boring side. Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal! I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime. If the schools are trying to expose antsy kids to Dickens, they may be better served with A Tale of Two Cities, which moves a bit faster in my opinion. The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\" whats going to happen next?\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory. I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations. I enjoy Dickens, so when I decided to read Great Expectations, I had just that... Great expectations. Unfortunately, this novel is the most boring tripe I've ever read. The 'hero' is nothing but a whiner with a 'poor me' complex.Don't waste your time, read one of Dickens' other books. I am amazed that it took me 61 years to get around to reading this book. I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon... To say Great Expectation is \"Classic\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired. I highly recommend Great Expectations and eagerly look forward to A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist.Dawn Kurtz author ofSecret of the Mexican Doll Definitely not a modern read, but that can be a good thing. The style of of writing in Mr. Dickens's era may seem a little over the top by current literature, but the character's grab you, you want to know how they do, what they do. Inlove good storytelling. The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild. Good seller. Charles Dickens is absolutely classic. I read this book in high school myself, now my son is reading it. I'm sure he'll enjoy. It's a brand new paper back book at a great price. You can't go wrong buying this. I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once. In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb. Who knew that a book written almost 150 years ago could be so great? Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \"Mrs. Joe\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \"rampages\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\" Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions. My personal favorite movie version of Great Expectations is the 1999 Masterpiece theatre version. This book was literally the worst thing thats happened in my whole entire life.I was forced to read this long. boring book for english class and either fell asleep, or sat there and sared off into spce.THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!The only GOOD thing about this book is that I hav found a new way to doze off without sum sleeping pills (just read the first two pages and WALLA ure fast asleep!!!!!!!) Reading isn't usually something I choose to do in my spare time. My daughter was reading this for school, so I decided to read it too because of her reaction to it. This is not your every day novel! The more I read it, the madder I got. I couldn't read it for an extended amount of time, because I would become too angry to continue. But then I had to pick it up again to find out what happened. This book is a pure emotional ride. I love it! Well written and the drawings are wonderful. The story itself is well written and put in a time period which was a difficult time for children who didn't have much finances or many options to obtain employment they would enjoy. the thoughts through the boys eyes are amazing after all the situations he gets into. even a little trouble could be a really big deal back then. I am so sorry I didn't get to this before today...I thought I had done it already.....please forgive me....totally my fault....I have so enjoyed this wonderful book and its just as described...thanks again..will buy from you often....GREAT SELLER!!!! AAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++ I started reading this over a month ago and I'm still not finished. I can't get into it at all! It's like a really boring nightmare! I mean, the parts that take place at Satis House are mildly interesting, but no part of it seems to be building up to anything. The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't! It's just sitting there in its stupid rocking chair knitting and petting its cat by the fire, which isn't even burning! OMG!You want to read something fast paced and interesting?Try Daniel White's Hellstone, available right here at amazon.com (plug). Now that's a good book. White's influences span the ages, and don't skip Victorian, if that's what you're into, which you obviously are, or why would you be here?Don't get me wrong. I like Victorian literature. A Christmas Carol is a very good story, as is Dracula, and Frankenstein, and most of Poe's works. It's just this particular book that I don't like...and anything by Jane Austen.In conclusion, buy Hellstone. You'll be happy you did. i received the book today and it is brand new! great book and i recommend this book for all ages The reason that I chose this book was because I saw the play at my high school.I thought that this play was performed really good by the student body,so i decided to read the book, and the book was pretty good. I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together. I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect. The old english styled language at first was a bit difficult to comprehend the first few chapters, so it took me a while to read them. However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend. This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book. Clean good story. Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand."

         "A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)",
         "This was the first IAD book that I read--and I was blown away. Fabulous characters. Great twisting plot. This story definitely puts a new spin on paranormal romance. The hero was dark, and he struggled with his growing feelings for the heroine. The action was non-stop, and I couldn't put the book down. I like werewolf heroes, but Cole took her hero to a whole new level. And pairing him with a half-vamp heroine...so good! Definitely recommend this book. Lachlian a Scottish Werewolve (the king of the Weres) from the highlands. He is angry, bitter, mentaly unstable, strong as sin, and so hot its painful.He is tourtured undergrown by Vampires for almost 200 years when he finally escapes. He finds the streagth to do so because he smells his fated mate above ground and thinks that his only refuge will be to find her; that with-in her he can heal his emotional wounds and all that good stuff.When he gets loose by tearing off his own leg (no worries it regenrates in a week), hits the streets of Paris on a rampage and finds her. Its then that he discovers to his outrage she is a Vampire. He lothes Vampires, which is understandable, seeing how he was toutoured by them for 200 years.The chapater in which he captures her, by chasing her down in the rain and climbing ontop of her in a park is oh so shamefully good!She is scared near to death. One -- she's never been away from home, has never seen a Werewolve, and was raised by druid/elfs/witches so she has never even seen a Vampire other then herself. She has no idea what he wants of her and no idea of what he entends to do with her. She is young for an imortal only in her 70's and her name is Emmaline.He makes her take him to her hotel room where he plans to make up for all that time in hell. Since she is a Vampire he can't help but treat her badly; he doesn't want his mate to be a leach. Then again he is torn, he doesn't want to loose his mate after waiting for so long. the guy has been underground for 200 years and isn't right in the head to put it midly.Emmaline is pretty liakble, you feel for her. She is young minded and neive. In the middle of the book she is a tad inmature and annoying, but that changes. The story is great. Emmaline never knew her parents. Her mother killed herself and her father just happens to be the head baddy Vamp of the \"Horde\" a warring faction of Vampires who drink to kill. When Emmaline finds this out its a shame because her father just happens to be the man that put Lachlian away for all that time.Emmaline has to do some soul searching and it envolves confronting her father - I won't spoil it sorry, but the last half of the book is thrilling!Great book!!! Super hot Werewolve! This was the first book I read from the author kresley cole and I haven't looked back. I have bought every single book from this author. It has everything a story should include: chemistry, love, passion, action, adventure ect. She is one of my top three authors. After enduring years of torture from the vampire horde, Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the Lykae Clan, is enraged to find the predestined mate he's waited millennia for is vampire. But now he has scented her, his mate, the one woman for him alone. I love the way he Loves Emma,(his Emmaline) With all of his revenge and hate for Vampire's, he could have done her great harm, but he did not. I like the way, the story was written, I went out and got the next book(No Rest for the Wicked). I am not much on writing long Reviews but I will say that I am very glad I read the whole book and didn't put it down or stop in between. It was an awesome read and very SEXY and HOT. I enjoyed this book and it is worth your time. I was looking for something after Black Dagger Brotherhood Series and this was a PLEASANT surprise to say the least. ROMANCE, LUST, ADVENTURE, SUSPENSE..and plenty of PARANORMAL activity ... great book!!!!!!!! Lachlain is the long lost king of the Lykae Clan, taken captive by the Horde Vampire Clan for the last 150 years tortured endlessly in the fire pits below the city of Paris, France. Emma the Timid is the cherished, sheltered and protected half Vampire and half Valkyrie raised by her Valkyrie aunts. Emma has never seen another Vampire and certainly not one of those animalistic Lykae. Emma is in Paris looking for information on the father she never knew, Lachlain is chained to the fire below the city when he scents Emma and knows she's his mate. Lachlain severs his leg to escape the pits to get to his fated mate. Emma is alone and hungry in the city when an enraged beast grabs her and forces her to take him back to her hotel. Lachlain is enraged that fate would give him a vampire as his fated mate! He decides then and there he will make her pay for all the years that he was held captive by her kind. Will Emma the Timid's gentle nature tame the wild beast?In this book Emma really grows as a character going from Emma the Timid to Emma the King Killer. Throughout the book you watch as Emma develops a back bone and starts living up to both sides of her heritage. Using the training her aunts forced on that she never excelled at, no longer is Emma the Timid running from sword practice and avoiding conflict but a true Valkyrie in the flesh with silver in her eyes and passion in her heart. By the end of the book you kind of feel like a proud momma watching your little girl grow up and become a woman as she stands up not only to her fierce man but her exceedingly difficult aunts.Lachlain as a character I am somewhat torn. As a male that was tortured for 150 years I expected him to be more tortured in mind and spirit. I tend to like my \"tortured\" males to be more brittle and haunted in spirit except for a couple of rages he seems to keep it together better than you would expect of a man/beast that was kept in the pits of hell for over a century. As an overbearing over protective Lykae he plays the part perfectly. You can't help but like him and keep hoping he is able to win over Emma in his botched attempts to win her heart. Kresely Cole really helps you get into Lachlain's character while writing with the Scottish brogue. It is absolutely delicious!Overall this is a great read; there is plenty of action in and out of bedroom. You get to watch Emma grow as a women and Lachlain struggle not only to win Emma over but to acclimate to the 21st century that he has been thrust into, having never seen a TV or a car. You are introduced to new characters that you will be seeing in several books to come. And as always you find yourself laughing from Kresley Cole's humor. I love a book that can make both your heart race from the steamy passion and then turn around and make you laugh. I absolutely loved this book! I'm currently reading the 3rd in the series \"wicked deeds on a winter's night\". I enjoyed the 2nd and I am enjoying the 3rd with plans to read all in the series. Great novel, I liked how it started and focused on the main couple, not going to other stupid topics, like many other paranormal novels~However what really made me like this story was lachlain, i like his nature, the way he thinks. ^_^as for emma, she was emotional, and had a unique personality, which made for a more intresting story :)I'm very thankful to the friend that recommended this story to me~&lt;3 Plenty of details about the book can be found on other reviews..so I'll go ahead and dive into a different sort of review! I've been reading romance novels since I was 13 years old and much to my dismay the genre has taken a downhill nose dive lately. I'm a huge fan of Feehan but I find that her newer books in the Dark Series lacked the excitement of previous installments! I was skeptical when I picked up my copy of A Hunger Like No Other but much to my utter delight I adored it! Run out and grab a copy you won't be disappointed! Ms. Cole does an amazing job with this book and I'm very eager for the next installment! If you feel bored with romance lately, you won't with this!!! Sizzling, Funny, and a perfect story is all found between the pages of this one! My keeper shelf hasn't seen a book in a while...this has an honorary place on that shelf now! Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on \"Lover Awakened\" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ...Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ...Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ... I liked the vampires, the lycans, the valkaries.I liked the way the story was told. I just liked this book.Can't wait to get the second in the series! Hurry up Amazon and send it to me!!! The IAD books are great but the beginning of A Hunger Like No Other was amazing, I have never been so grabbed by a book before this. I hope everyone will read and enjoy this book as I have. In the beginning, they seem unlikely. As the story wound on I kept waiting for chemistry between Emma and Lachlain. But he kept being forceful and she kept hating him. When I hear about relationships that are like this from friends I think \"Those two need to break up...now!\"What really bugs me is if Emma can't lie and she's \"the good one of the two\" (if that's possible--they're both monsters!) why doesn't she give a damn that her people have tortured Lachlain for 150 years and that's the real reason he's been so gruff with her, because he's still hurting about that. And she's mourning the fact that she's an outcast hybrid breed. Both have parents who are dead, so, I guess that makes the couple even more of \"headcases\".The bottom line is as the story goes on, your hope for these two fades faster and faster and by the time they actually \"do it\" on page 250, I really don't care anymore. The author has made it such an unenjoyable read and I don't believe that they'd want to \"do it\" at that point. Why??? What has changed so much by page 250? She just took his gifts (a locket and horse), and didn't even say thank you. What a spoiled princess! If it was me, I'd be highly insulted and would snatch the gifts back.Honestly I might skim to the end, but after page 250, I set the book down and just want to go to her next book. I've heard that's the best one.EDIT: I did read the ending. It was actually pretty good, I wish the rest of the book had been like that. Emma growing up at the end was great.EDIT #2: After reading all six books in the Immortals After Dark series, and the prequel \"The warlord wants forever\" I have to say, I LOVE THIS SERIES. If you don't like book one, go on to the other five books and the prequel, which I enjoyed ten times more. With each book Kresley won my heart until by the sixth book, Kiss of a Demon King, I accepted the fact than I'm a full-on fan girl now! Kresley is awesome! This author knew exactly what she wanted and how to accomplish it. This magnificent novel is one to never forget especially with the realistic characters, perfect plot, and wonderful ending. This series is one of my favorite. I just hope she keeps on writing. (Hopefully she'll start working on nix's story.) I have been seeing this series come up in comments on paranormal pages I subscribe to so I decided to give it a read. Wow! I was hooked from the first page! The characters were amazing! The story pacing was great (it was very hard to put this book down to go to bed) and I am absolutely looking forward to every book in this series! And anything else written by Kresley Cole! This series has been recommended to me constantly on every internet board and from all my friends and family who read books similar to me. I finally gave in and bought a few of them. Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy are two of my very favorite genre's. I've greatly enjoyed many different books from the Dark Hunter to the Carpathian series and from Kate Daniels to Mercy Thompson.I cannot think of a time I've been this disappointed in a book or series. I didn't like the characters at all. Emma was a whiny, spoiled, timid little thing - and even the ending could not save my opinion of her. Lachlain deserved far better than what she was offering that's for sure. As for him he started strong and then deteriorated to some whipped puppy giving Emma baubles and trinket's and hoping she'd stay. He's the Lykae king? Really?There are some other characters introduced as well - I found all of Emma's \"Aunt's\" to be obnoxious and without too many redeeming qualities. They're very weird as well. I still, after I finished the book, hardly understand what they are, what that means, and how they are all connected. And the way they talk - OIY! Juvenile and insipid - they sound like they are trying to be teenage girls. It just comes off as extremly lame. Lachlain's contingency was better - his brother, assistant, and the female werewolf were pretty good.As for the plot it too started out strong like Lachlain but it fizzled mightily in the middle wandering a bit aimlessly. The last 50 pages actually brought my rating from 1 star to 2. To be honest much of the book left me confused about how this world worked - and why. It was too much and not enough information at all once.And the romance - start, stop, start, stop, start, stop and so on and so on and so on until you want to scream. Unfortunately not in a good way! The sexual tension seemed forced and awkward. The scenes themselves were written fine - the characters just didn't fit well.I see this book gets good reviews but I cannot figure it out. When my sister called last night to ask me how the books were even she was shocked at my reaction. I did ask about the rest of the series and if they got better and then she told me \"the news\" that the next book is about one of the \"aunt's\" (the ones who raised Emma). Ugh. No thank you times 10! I don't think this series will be for me but I'll try one more. If you've got a recommendation for which one you'd recommend please share it.I don't have to love a character to like a novel - and on occasion I've even hated a character and loved a novel. However I cannot deal with characters that annoy me so much I want to throw the book across the room. Probably the biggest book shock I've had in years as far as expectations. Technically this is Kresley's first full novel and I am going to say that it was wonderful. Her most recent stuff is better but that doesn't mean that I don't give two thumbs up to this one. Lachlan, after being tortured for 150 years scents his mate and will do anything to get her. Poor Emmaline is gentler than a fly but after meeting Lachlan she toughens up and becomes his Mate. Even killing a vampire in the process. It wasn't easy to make Emmaline fall for Lachlan though. Read to find out how he did it. I will say her lust for him was one key part ;) Loved it can't get enough of the lore!Was caught from page one. Cole has the best characters and story lines. Again loved it! A hunger like no other was really a delicious read but what stopped me from giving this book a five star review was that Emmaline (the Heroine who was half valkyrie and half vampire) managed to get on my nerves quite a few times. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying the chemistry her and Lachlain shared.Both the hero and heroine's coming together was just sizzling H-O-T. It left me wishing that my room had an air conditioner. What made it even better was all the sexual tension the two shared right up until that moment.Lachlain is one of those alpha-males (and he's a werewolf!) that you don't want to miss reading about. By the end of the book, I was waiting for my very own Lachlain to appear, claim me as his mate and then kidnap me away.I warn you ladies, if you're going to pick up this book, make sure you have either a box of chocolates or an available man handy so that you can take out your sexual frustrations after you're done reading! Admission: I have never read a romance novel before A Hunger Like No Other. I write myself (don't we all), and I read mostly things with cobwebs on'm. Faulkner, Dostoevsky, Handyman's Guide to the Cursed HomeOwner--you know, no modern fiction. But I've always been fascinated by the vampire myth, and it hasn't left me. Quite the opposite as I approach death myself. The dark world is darker around me, but this Kindle demanded to be fed, and I said, read some good vampire book, thriller. Stephen King is too wordy and not much there anymore. What to do? I scrounge around the net (like a lykae through a Valkyrie garbage dump), and I finally found this K. Cole who many said wrote interesting things. Well, god bless its little heart, the Kindle delivers up samples of the books it's offering, and I think that if a book can't start well and grab you, then screw it. I downloaded \"A Hunger....\" and it caught my interest. Try reading the beginning offered unto you, and you decide. My screenwriter side said immediately, this is very visual. That means movie or t.v. series. Why, you ask? Because it's a love story struck from the white marble of wildly improbable lovers, a world unseen by humans that coils around our reality, and a great gift for writing supremely erotic passages but staying within the bounds of eumpemistic altruistic good taste (and believe me, there's a lot of tasting going on between various creatures). Ms. Cole obvious realizes that even werewolves and vampire and strange critters from the halls of ancient pagan imaginations need to lick and suck and swat at shapely butt. Our author wraps quite a deep seated wildness around the cobwebs of darkdom, and it works! Plus she weaves the language of the modern world in with mythical creatures that seem would only exist outside the world. No, we are in the world, but this world of Ms. Coles is big enough for lots of furry, hot-bodied critters. I read Ms. Cole is married and has kids. I would imagine, that Ms. Cole has padded her bedroom with foot thick oaken walls, redolent with the scent of old blood and screams of pleasure kept from her kids. Her descriptions of love making and lust are so real and so accurate, that no imagination could have conjured them up without at least experiencing most of what ere she writes. And it goes to show yah, that even regular folks, walking around the mall may be incredible lovers and romantic as all get out, but we only can hope, huh?One more thing I admire about her book: she knew how to finish it. Usually, the hardest thing to do with a movie, book, play is to have a good ending. Beginnings are a dime a dozen. And working one's way through from the beginning is just labor, usually. But to have a coherent whole, and a day new mount of edible proportions (with a bit of incest hinted at) makes for some wild narrative directions and conclusions.If you want a sexy, strange, but vaguely familiar book to read with one's hand perched nearby, just in case--then read this one. You can hold a Kindle with one hand. I promise you. And so, in Florida, lives this blond housewife with her family, and her very lucky husband from in the depths of them all springs forth red hot writing, writhing, and wanton abandon. And lots of cool sword play and nasty ways of torurting vampires.... stuff I'd never thought of--the ramifications of being immortal and always being able to heal...... Ms. Cole coldly makes that the stuff of a level of Hell Dante's Virgil could never have stumbled across.Buy the thing. Read it. Emma, you hot little wench. Such a baby-doll of a vampire, but what a supremely carnal and sensual babe you became! With alomost all of my favorite Paranormal/Paranormal Romance authors letting me down with thier latest releases, Sherrilyn Kenyon and L.K. Hamilton being the biggest let downs, I was beginning the think the genre was on it's way out.Thank you Kresley Cole for restoring my faith! This was a huge breath of fresh air and brilliant writing. Her paranormal world is vast, interesting and filled with wonderful people you can't wait to know more about. Her Hero and Heroine are spot on! I can't thank KC enough for helping to keep the genre fresh are exciting while others are failing. I loved this book and hope it becomes a new series! I will totally be getting more books by Cole. This book was hot, steamy, AND had a plot! The author didn't take up the whole book with superfluous love scenes, but the love scenes it did have were well integrated, storyline appropriate, and definitely left you panting for more.Emmaline Troy is a rare female vampire/valkryie hybrid. She lives with her coven of Valkyrie who have raised her since she was a baby when her own mother, the legendary Helen of Troy, died. She doesn't know who her father is since her mother refused to tell anyone. On a trip to Paris she hopes to find information that will lead her to her father. Unbeknownst to her Lachlan the king of the Lycae (werewolves) lies trapped beneath the city, burning continually. With his superhuman senses he detects his mate in the city above. In a crazed, mad frenzy he amputates his own leg (don't worry it regenerates) in order to get free and find his mate who he has waited for for over a thousand years. Following her scent he tracks his mate down. To his horror (and hers) he discovers his mate is a hated vampire, the very creatures responsible for his imprisonment and continual burning for centuries. Outraged and half-insane he takes out his fury on Emma. Eventually, his anger ceases but its too late now for Emma (known as Emma the Timid) is terrified of him. Eventually, they come to love each other. But just as they are settling into their relationship Emma comes to a horrible realization. Her father is Demestriu, King of the Vampire Horde, and the one responsible for killing Lachlan's brother and imprisoning him. Believing that she is tainted, and that Lachlan will hate her because of her father, Emma flees to Demestriu's hidden palace to kill him. Surprisingly, she accomplishes what so many have failed to do, her father's death. But she is mortally wounded and heads back to her Valkyrie coven. Lachlan tries to see her but the Valkyrie distrust him and refuse to let him see her. Eventually everything gets worked out and they all live happily ever after. This book is a great beginning in this new paranormal romance series with great descriptions and in depth characterizations. This is a definite must read! I really liked this book. It was a good start to the series. I fell in love with characters and wanted more after I finished reading it. Kresley Cole did not dissapoint! Now comfortably organized among my favorite novels, I can't plug this title enough to friends and family who are fans of romance - paranormal or otherwise. Super hot page turner, it had me giggling within the first naughty (*ooo! naughty!) ten pages, and two days later I'm ready to pick it up again for the long weekend. This is one you hold on to and keep rereading.Thank you Kresley Cole! My tastes run more historical with romance genre rather than preternatural, and after my last fiasco into the category, I was ready to call a major time-out (see my reviews). However, this is as perfect as it gets - a super-charged attraction, endearingly flawed hero and heroine, compelling backdrop. You don't have to wait before it gets going. The tension starts on the first page and doesn't end until the end... ah, wonderful, wonderful cheese!He's the ancient werewolf king (of course, heh) recently escaped from a tortured imprisonment, and she's a recently-spawn half vampire / half valkyrie, but a compassionate wimp - a creature who can't bring herself to harm anything - even to nip enough blood to keep her healthy. Admirable, but worrisome. I've a penchant for the whole 'alpha-male / alpha-female / trouble ensues' and usually slink away from the 'weak, whining female stereotype,' because normally, I just want to slap them, but fragile Emmaline Troy has enough modern-style chutzpah to take on overbearing protagonist Lachlain on her own terms. On the streets of Paris, she's seeking the story of her unique lineage, and when he scents her deep within his horrifying confinement, he draws strength enough to break free in search of his one true mate (ahhh, me). Enter the conflict: vampires, werewolves and valkyrie tribes have been battling for countless centuries... the gods must hate them both. When he abducts her, the journey is a never-want-to-end romp of desperate desire, hilarity, property damage and ooooh, mature sexual content... mmmm mmmm good!Kresley Cole is able to masterfully mix the familiar with her own spawned lore, and throw in a few contemporary references to make you laugh out loud. She adeptly mixes IPods with primeval weaponry and nail polish with ancient customs. It's a smart book, well-written and an absolute keeper. The characterization is fully formed, locations lushly depicted, supporting characters quirky and interesting... and I'm sure I'm not the only one impatiently waiting to see which one stars in her next novel. You'll just love Emmaline's doddering valkyrie aunt Nix, and feel for Lachlain's friend Bowe's misery. Try not to double over in laughter when you learn who Emmaline's mom is. The boyfriend almost made me stop reading for fear I would choke myself with it. Poor guy, he had to sit so patiently when I was compelled to give him a play by play of the plot.Read this book, it's so entertaining. Warning: don't bring this as beach reading, you're likely to forget to turn before you get a serious sunburn. Get all the chores done, find a quiet spot indoors, turn ON the air conditioner and enjoy! Kresley Cole is an amazing writer, I have read all of her releases to date. She has created a world and people that I never want to see go. I feel like I know each character, all their quirks, strengths and weaknesses. I will be the first to admit that I am experiencing Twilight Saga withdrawal and was looking for a little Vampire Romance. I am an old school Anne Rice fan from the 90's and hadn't read much in this genre for awhile. Well, this series is no Twilight and is certainly for mature audiences. But, I enjoyed the book. I also think she is a funny writer. Half-way through the book, I looked the author up to see how she looked because her writing was so humorous and contemporary. I am glad I found this series. She definitely has a new fan. I have read all Kresley Cole`s books and all of them are 5 star reads. Yet this one is absolutely the hottest one. It was a perfect start for the serie. Lachain is an animal. 100% alpha. Emmaline seems fragile & weak compered to him but has an inner strenght matching her mate`s. Simply perfect! This is the the second book in the series( first book is in an anthology tittled playing easy to get) and one of my favorites. if you like to laugh as much as you like passion and down right steamy sex senes, you will love this book.(as well as the series)a brief desciption of the story..lachlain is a lycke a.k.a werewolf who has been trapped and tortured for over a 100 yrs. when he smells his mate from his dungen, he breaks free to find her. only to realise she is one of his most hated enemies, a vampire.this book is fast paced, funny and very sexy, can't say enough about how much I love this series. I gave this book 5 stars, but I'd give it 10 if I could. It was thrilling and romantic to the end. Can't wait for the next one. Witty and interesting characters. I would like to read more from this author. This book is delicious! This is an addicting tale with all the supernatural creatures of the world.A great battle is in the midst between all the clans of the Lore. Vampires, Lykae (werewolves), witches, ghouls, and Valkyries, are all out to win over the other at all cost. However, Lachlain, the Lykae King escapes from being imprisoned and tortured by the vampires and begins the search of his one true love, the real battle begins when he finds her, Emma, half vampire and half Valkyrie.This is an exhilarating story on the challenges of when love is forbidden and what extremes have to be conquered to get to that happy ending. I was up until 2am trying to race to the end of this book....to say I was having a good time, is putting it mildly. Go, buy this book, you can thank me later...and you will, thank me, that is.Why are you still here, reading this review..GO BUY THIS BOOK!Were's, vamps, ghouls, demigods, witty banter, a hot guy, what more do you want?? Go, get out of here and spend some money. OMG! indeed. I simply cannot get enough of this book! I'm rereading the IAD series, but this is my favorite! I've read it at least twice since I purchased it this last March! Searing passion, awesome characters, action, vampires, Lykeas, sharp wit, humor, and the clear, strong voice of the writer, this is a definate keeper. If you love big, strong, handsome men who want to take you away and ...bite you and make you his forever then BUY THIS BOOK! You will NOT be disappointed! The energy of this novel! It's years after I first read this book and I still sit around thinking of how fun the trailer would be... option this whole series--get Joss and watch the millions roll in! This was the first novel I ever read that had the immediacy and diction of my every day interactions. Ms. Cole has stayed current linguistically speaking, enabling you to more closely relate to her non-human characters-- who seem all-too-human. Her multi-dimensional characterization is just one reason to enjoy these action-packed books. Nevermind the title- I almost didn't bother reading this because it sounded so over the top, but I can't tell you how glad I am I took the chance.This is the first full book in this series. I admit to not having read the short story that actually begins it! Ms. Cole has created a compelling world with many supernatural species and clever ways of bringing about fated romance.Although the romance side of things is somewhat predictable and at times cliche, it is actually more of a comfort than anything else. The characters can be ridiculous and fun and the romance starts of rocky (to say the least). Watching them work through seemingly monumental issues of birthrights, cultural disparities and prejudices is just downright fun. At times, it can feel like a guilty pleasure to read this book- and the ones that come next!In the end, the important thing to know about this book and the ones that follow is that they are very much like chocolate. Sinfully delicious, guilty pleasures. You have to read them! I had a little trouble with the first couple of chapters, the main male character is such a domineering alpha-male *&^% (insert expletive here). Once beyond that, I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed the Valkrye, Weres, and Vamps. If you like paranormal romance, you'll enjoy this one. If you like this one and haven't tried: Charlaine Harris or Kelly Armstrong you should. After being unable to put down each of the three MacCarrick series books I raced to grab this too. But sadly there are so many things off in this book, I'm absolutely astounded by the rave reviews.Main Characters: Both are unbelievable and borderline cliche. Lachlain is your classic super hottie, powerful, werewolf king (thus making him also extremely wealthy), who is good at everything he does. For bonus \"hot points\" he's also a scottish werewolf because we love it when gravel-voiced men say things like, \"Lass, I doona want you to leave, ken?\" Well OK we do love that but lets keep it for Highlander books or other historicals where its reasonably germane to the plot and not just tacked on for fun. Supposedly he is tortured by the 150 years of pain he suffered at the hands of an evil vampire. Although frankly this barely surfaces other than as a somewhat weak basis for his poor behavior at the beginning of the book.His mate, Emma, is little better. She's a small wafish beauty who is gentle, sweet, and innocent. Although she also seems to prefer to dress an extremely provocative way that seems to go against the \"sweet and innocent\" description (the picture on the cover says it all - read leather S&M; ensemble?). She is supposed to be younger (a mere 70 years) and her only interests prior to traveling to Europe and meeting Lachlain were watching movies, her iPod, and regularly painting her toes. She never comes together as a plausible or interesting character.Mythology: So the main immortals are the vampires, the werewolves, and the valkyrie. They all have some concept of finding the ONE (though they go by different names) which brings out a huge passion and has the men using the word \"MINE\" a lot. Clearly Kresley is setting the stage for a long and lucrative series of romance novels here.However the Valkyrie were particularly frustrating. They are warrior women who live on electricity (instead of food). However they also seem to produce lightning whenever they're upset. Or they poop lightning, I couldn't quite figure out how that worked. They also seem prone to screeching and histrionics. When not screaming they also have a fondness for toenail polish, movies, and making popcorn which they don't eat but like throwing about like a hoard of 12 year old girls. Supposedly they are unearthly gorgeous although it was hard to anchor this fact alongside all the screeching and popcorn throwing.There is an enormous cast of background characters mentioned briefly and they clearly placeholders for future books. Every mention is a mildly annoying distraction - throwing out 1-2 leads for future books is acceptable (Ward heavily leverages this technique) but I felt like this book was planting the seeds for a 20 book series.Romance: As many have mentioned, their first encounter is unsettling in that it is borderline rape. Their next real encounter is when he marks her under the full moon. I think it was supposed to be a lusty romp in the woods but frankly it was too abrupt a turnaround for the innocent virginal girl who wanted nothing to do with him 5 minutes ago and now is rutting in the mud with wild abandon (I think she has like 18 orgasms, I lost count and started skimming at a certain point).JR Ward is flawed but I would recommend over this book. The MacCarrick trilogy is fantastic and I hope to see more from Kresley Cole! JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood \"Lover\" series got me hooked on paranormal romance. I've been on the look-out for anything that is even close to as good. I've tried Nalini Singh's psy-changeling series and although interesting, it's not in the same class as the brotherhood. After reading Cole's first two Immortal After Dark books....the first being the novella in the book Playing Easy to Get and now A Hunger Like No Other, I'm convinced that this series rivals the \"Brotherhood\" in it's intensity and appeal.This is a story about a Lykae king and his half vampire/half Valkyrie mate. Lachlain is the king who was imprisoned and tortured heavily by a vampire. He is in agony, chained to a wall in a fiery furnace like hell when he scents his mate. He amputates his own leg to escape and find her, only to find that she is a vampire...the same kind that imprisoned him and are his sworn enemies.Emma is none to pleased either when she is taken to his home and told that she was his mate. Their journey to Lachlain's home is laced with humor and sexy interactions as both try in vain to fight their growing attraction.I really like this world that Cole introduces us to. It's not difficult to understand like I've found Singh's to be, and I really like all the different aspects of the Lore and how they relate to each other. As in the first book, The Warlord takes a Bride, this book is speckled with fun secondary characters that would make great books of their own.No matter what, \"A Hunger Like No Other\" will remain a favorite. I loved the evolution of this relationship. What begins as disappointment and disillusionment with each other becomes \"oh so much more\" as they realize just how suited they are despite the seemingly unsurmountable odds they face. This is a passionate, sensual, and unique love story.Don't Miss It! After reading Kresley Cole's novella in \"Playing Easy to Get\", I went directly to the bookstore to buy \"A Hunger Like No Other\". And yeah baby, it is good! (... just the cover is worth the buy all by itself; awesome, isn't it?) If you read the publishers' summary, you know what it's about: Lachlain MacRieve, king of the Lykae, was shackled in Paris' catacombs by the Vampires - mortal enemies of the Lykae - to be burned alive again and again. For 150 years he endures the pain and only when he finally smells his mate does he get the desperate strength to break through the chains. But when he puts his paws on Emmaline however, it's to discover that she's a cursed vampire; as he's still three quarter crazy from the last 150 years, he's much rougher on her than he should. As for Emmaline, half Vampire/half Valkyrie, despite being raised in a Valkyrie coven, she's not tough, and not brave either (her usual response to confrontation is flight). So Lachlain's harsh treatment does not to endear him to her.... despite the way he raises in her a desire she never (literally) felt.This book is Cool (no, the uppercase C is not a mistake) and the world Cole develops, with the intermingling Lore creatures and everything, gleeful; the posturing and reparties between the Valkyries, for example, are terminally hip. As for when Lachlain finally let go of his prejudice... yummy-yum! Also, the way Emmaline finally comes into her own make for good moments - even though it takes her a loooooong time to do it. In fact, and this is the only bad thing I have to say, the way the relationship between Lachlain and Emma goes (take-tow-steps-forward/take-two-steps-back) becomes annoying after a while... I was into the contemporary romances and didn't realize that the contemporary paranormal romance better. Mrs.Cole captures her readers and brings them into a pleaseruable realm. She has taken the paranormal genre and created her very own legends and lore...filled with ultra entertaining characters.Emmaline is half vampire and half Valkyrie. Trying to find her place in the world. Being different, she feels lonely because there are no other half vampire and half Valkyrie.Lachlain has spent the last hundred and fifty years being tortured by the vampire Demestriu. He is slowly going mad and then...he scents his mate.And his mate happens to be Emmaline.He must battle his hatred for vampires, and welcome his llove for Emmaline.The Capulets and Montegues had nothing on this new 21st century romance of Romeo & Juliet. I put this on my Kindle because I recently got into PR and saw that it had such a high rating from an established author. Big mistake. Should have read the reader reviews more carefully. Make *no* mistake. What happens within the first two chapters of this book is sexual assault. No \"sort of\" or \"almost\" or \"close to\" as suggested by other reviewers. Take it from someone who has worked in the system: what the so-called hero commits is flat-out kidnapping and sexual assault. If that's your thing, proceed. If not, turn away from this one. Shame on you, Ms. Cole."

         "Manhunt Cassette",
         "Easy read and would have probably liked it better if I had not just finished the whole Plum series which are WONDERFUL! Although I like Janet Evanovich's more recent offerings, her early romance novels are a lot of fun, too. This one is a trifle different, starting out with a savvy city girl who sets out to find a husband in the untamed wilds of Alaska. Although the heroine makes some mistakes in this challenging place that land her in some wacky situations, she manages to use her vice-president-of-a-big-company brains and experience to tame both her environment and marriage-shy man of her dreams. The title and cover were initially a bit off-putting to me, but I'm glad I read it because it is a rather interesting take on the traditional romance. Another fun book to read from Ms Evanovich. Simple. Easy to read. Enjoyable! I'm sure you'll agree... Manhunt was thrilling and educational to read. When I was first introduced to the book, I thought to myself what more can I learn about Lincoln's assassination. To my surprise, the book incorporated the back-stories and people I was unaware about. James L. Swanson successfully tells the story from many different of angles. He swiftly and easily jumps from person to person to give different people's point of views. For example, when the assassination just occurred, he places the reader into four different people's shoes. On many occasions, I find myself needing several minutes to process what is happening. This along with the immense amount of detail the book went into were the most enjoyable part of the book.Swanson often uses pages and pages to describe the smallest things. Like why Booth brought a knife and single shot pistol rather than a revolver. Another part I loved about the book was, Lincoln's assassination took place in the first 100 pages of the book. This was important to me because it kept the book rolling. Even from the first 100 pages, I was able to learn so much more than I had already knew. I was not aware that Booth tried to kidnap the president days before the assassination. Another aspect I loved about the book was how Swanson was able to tell the facts without it sounding like a history textbook. He is able to incorporate the emotions of people making it easier to relate to the charters. This is important to me because I like to place myself in people's shoes and see how I would react. From this book, I have a better understanding of all the players involved as well as Booth.Prior to the book, I had no idea how the U.S. government was able to catch the fugitive. So I was able to learn how he fled Washington and eventually to the location where he died. I will not give anything away but I can assure you it's very exciting. The book also sheds light on some conspiracy theories people have about the assassination. After reading some of the theories, I can conclude that they are not true. Manhunt is a real page turner. To conclude, if you want to know more about this historic incident in American history, Manhunt is the book for you. Love the Stephanie Plum series, but this was terrible. I usually stick with the worst books no matter what, but I gave up on this one after stomaching 2/3rds of it. She had something, a glimmer of setting, character...but it was cheesy, patronizing, insipid, ridiculous, cliche...icky boring mess. The daffy but determined heroine, the strong, manly man...and in two days of cliches, they realize they love each other. Ugh. This is a book for a thirteen year old girl, except for the abundant soft porn sex. This was a fun book to read and I laughed outloud. I keep it for times when I need a good laugh so I can reread it again. The young woman gives up a posh city job to go to Alaska where she bought a cabin and store sight unseen. Of course both are in sorry state and her high heels and suits don't really prepare her for a workday in Alaska! Some predictability but the characters are nicely wrought and are off-beat. If you need a smile or a chuckle this is for you. Just started this book. So far it is very entertaining. I like this author and will read more of her books. I like these books because they aren't really long books so if I start and stop I remember the things that are going on. This was the first of Janet Evanovich's novels I read, and I fell in love with the author after reading it. Evanovich has a great sense of humor, and has created a quick, fun read with MANHUNT. It entertains as a romantic comedy without the long, drawn out \"scenes of passion\" so well known for romance novels. Instead, it had me smiling, and laughing from beginning to end. This was my first Evanovich book...I was not impressed, but will take other reader's reviews and consider reading other books of hers. It was just too step-by-step, boy meets girl, etc... If you looking for funny characters entangled in a quirky fast-moving story line, this isn't it! I'm giving up on Janet E. this book was in the condition described and arrived in a timely fashion. i am satisfied with this purchase."

         "This is a wonderful book! I bought this book for my daughter when she was two years old and she still has this book and she is in her high school years. This book is written in free verse form. And to the critic who commented that the book was \"hard to understand\" well...there is nothing complicated about the storyline. The message is simple and beautiful: love yourself for who you are. When our friend gave us this book I was not thrilled. With the wiggle eyes poking out of the cover I thought it was going to be nothing special, relying wholly on the gimmick of the eyes to carry it through. Boy was I wrong! Not only are the illustrations fantastic throughout, but the rhyming thoughtful words bring this book home. I love the message that shines through to be true to yourself, you can accomplish great things no matter what size you are.We have read this book so many times that the words are engraved in my heart. I have memorized every line and love to read it to the kids. This is a wonderful addition to any child's library and a book your family will treasure.E's Thoughts (9yrs old):I liked this book because its about sea creatures. It's funny when Max eats pizza. I really like that the book rhymes. It's really well written and fun to read. The illustrations are very colorful and cartoonish. I would recommend this book to all kids, boys and girls. Everyone in our family loves to read it and I think your family would too!H's Thoughts (7 yrs old):I like that Max is trying to be big, but instead he gets fat. The googly eyes are cool too. I think Max is weird and cool. I love the pictures and watching Max grow.M's Thoughts (5 yrs old):I really like that there is a snail on every page. I like to search for them. I love Max's seahorse Sam. The pictures are all really cool. Of course, I like the eyeballs too!W's Thoughts (3 yrs old):I like about the oogly eyes. I would give this book five stars, but the wiggly eyes prevent this book from lining up on a bookcase.I disagree with the reviewer that said that the narrative in this book was poor. It's just fine. My two year old son enjoyed it tremendously and it is a fun read aloud."

         "Really well written. A great insight into the man. Certainly, worth the read. His Royal Highness Prince Al-Waleed is one of today's most extraordinary, important and fascinating muslims.This authorized biography largely projects him as he wishes to be seen. Many may argue that this may be very different from how he sees himself, which may in turn be very different from how he is in reality. Critics may allege that the account is sugarcoated at best, or a 100% manufactured confection at worst.I believe, like the Prince, one must always be precise. Being precise means to abandon extrajudicial opinions and thinking i.e. unsubstantiated opinions based on heresay, speculation, suspicion, innuendo, logical fallacies and ill-intent. This kind of sloppy thinking is unfortunately more widespread in the urbane \"educated\" population (likely to be reading this review) than in the razor-witted yet simple bedouins that accompany His Royal Highness.A principle of Islamic Law states that the burden of proof lies upon the accuser(s). Another Islamic principle is: \"Be hard on yourself and easy on others\".Obviously HRH is not perfect. But How many muslims can boast not having missed a single prayer in 25 years? How many are as disciplined? How many are as punctual? and How many would retain these and other qualities after having a net worth over $20 billion?Ofcourse, being a connected Royal must have helped, but out of the over 5000+ Princes how many are as successful? or half, or a third as successful? Clearly, he did it on his own merit.Fate deals us a hand in everything, whether it be genetics or circumstances, it is up to us to best play that hand. It is all about tapping into potential and maximizing the \"IRR\".I certainly believe the account narrated by Riz Khan puts HRH squarely in the same league as Gates, Buffet etc. To suggest otherwise is sloppy thinking. In fact, in some ways he supersedes them.To me this book indicates, in general, the future of Islam and Muslims since I view the Prince as a symbol of religious belief, tradition, progress, hardwork, fairness and youth.He is just as similiar to the common muslim, as he is dissimiliar.Reading this book was a humbling, inspirational and revelatory experience. (I am not getting paid to write this!)I give the book 4 stars because I feel from a technical perspective the book could have been better written. It is sometimes redundant."

         "Encyclopedia of Women's Travel and Exploration:",
         "&quot;The Encyclopedia of Women's Travel and Exploration,&quot; by Patricia D. Netzley, packs a lot of information into more than 250 pages. The bulk of the book consists of alphabetically arranged short articles. Also included are a bibliography and index.The entries themselves fall into a number of categories: general subjects (Accommodations, Clothing, Culture Shock, Military Service, etc.); places both general and specific (Africa, Asia, Mount Everest, etc.); important books in the field of women's travel; types of female travelers (Missionaries, Pilgrims, Pirates, Queens, Spies, etc.). There is an assortment of other articles on various interesting subjects (Mountaineering, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the Iditarod Dog Sled Race, etc.).There are also many entries devoted to individual travelers and explorers. It's truly a multicultural and international gathering of women: Clara Barton (a Red Cross leader), Nellie Bly (journalist), Susan Butcher (American dogsledder), Hsi Kai Ching Yih (19th century pirate of China), Jane Goodall (pioneer in chimpanzee research), Zora Neale Hurston (African-American anthropologist and writer), Margery Kempe (religious pilgrim of the Middle Ages), Junko Tabei (Japanese mountaineer), Edith Wharton (American writer), and many, many, more.It is fascinating to read of the lives of these women and learn of the huge diversity of reasons that led them to travel or explore. Netzley incorporates bibliographic references into the entries, so interested individuals have starting points for further reading. The book also includes a wealth of black-and-white photos of various women profiled in the book. Overall, this is an informative and enjoyable reference work that celebrates the courage, skills, and passion of generations of bold women."

         "Love the style and writing of Burroughs. A return to the books I read as a child and young adult in the backwood communities and tourist meccas of Northern Canada. Brings back many fond memories and seems to let the imagination flow freely and to another world, or place and time. A wonderful book. When I was a kid I had all the burroughs books in my collecting in paperback; what a joy it is to have all the books in E-book form. It is a great book. A very richly laid out world. I read it to my daughter and she loved it very much. This is the sequel toAt the Earth's Core. That book ended with the hero, David Innes, back on the surface world and separated from his mate, Dian the Beautiful. In this book, he returns to Pellucidar to get her back. This is a formula in many Edgar Rice Burroughs books; the hero becomes separated from his lady love, and has a series of adventures until he is reunited with her. It may be a formula, but it's a successful one. Sure, the plots may be similar, but there are always different strange, exotic worlds to encounter. There was a reason ERB was the most popular pulp writer of his time. Fans of pulp fiction will enjoy this book."

         "Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944",
         "The book is well researched backed by the author's visit to the battlefield site. He interviews numeorus survivors(mostly German) of the battle. It is a pity that the Russians are not more forthcoming in allowing researchers access to their archives.The only negative and I may be the only that thinks in this respect, is that I hate coffee table sized books. Expertly well written and researched - I am very very impressed. Find one and buy it! Excellent book, with loads of anecdotes and personal accounts, at least for the German side. The book would have been even better if the author could have managed to obtain more Soviet first hand accounts as well, but even without them he does a good job of describing and assessing the Soviet side of the battle as well. This book provided me with hours of enjoyable reading and study. Its the rare photo prints and maps that make the battle of the Cherkassy 'kessel' much more realistic. A must read for any Eastern Front enthusiast! This book is an exhaustive and detailed study that presents a nearly hour-by-hour accounting of the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket during three hard-fought weeks of January and February 1944. In addition to the facts of the battle, there is a wealth of supporting information regarding the commanders and their backgrounds, tactics, histories of the armies involved, great B&W; photos, maps, and first-hand soldier accounts. The battle itself was a disaster for the Wehrmacht and hastened the fall of the Ukraine. The Soviets sought to create a second Stalingrad (while the pocket contained 65,000 Germans, the Soviets thought it contained twice that number) and very nearly did.The overall description of the battle is very interesting and features ancillary topics such as the Luftwaffe's attempt to supply the soldiers trapped in the pocket. The first-hand accounts from both the German and Russian sides are fascinating to read - the hardships the Landser faced during the ordeal are unimaginable. This book is well worth the price but due to the amount of detail involved, is really best suited for serious students of die Ostfront."

         "Systematic Theology",
         "Solid, methodical, broad in reach, and always faithfully Reformed, Berkhof provides a much-needed compendium on Systematic Theology. This work is still used in numerous Seminaries and Bible colleges. In his magnum opus Berkhof stipulates theological truth as he explains all the essential doctrines of the Christian faith. The author confutes the myth that systematic theology is boring and reveals that when it comes to concise organized theological truth, no one outdoes his effort.Great for personal or family devotions! Perfect for Sunday school classes.World named it: \"One of the top 100 books of the millennium.\"With this book-Berkhof presents a readable and precise catalogue of theology that no one should ignore. Almost a 1000 pages and now it comes with a fine introduction. All ministers, seminary students, and even non-clergy should own this outstanding and substantial volume.There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies I have been reading many systematic theology books and other resources to keep my understanding straight regarding the sound doctrine. This is a serious and challenging task because today's prosperity gospel filled messages from many churches do not teach it properly. Finally, this is the one that I was looking for and by far the best I ever read. It will open your eyes and equip you for deeper understanding of Biblical truths. I strongly recommend it to everyone, especially Bible teachers ! I bought my first time systematic theology book in my life.Though it is a used one I am satisfied.God bless you.I recommend another good book to readfor \"knowing\" God more.The Mosaic of Christian BeliefThanks. This Systematic Theology by Berkhof is a gem. Get it. Check it out at the library or purchase it by clicking on that yellow button, or buy it & support a Confessional Reformed Seminary by hopping on to the WestminsterSeminary book store website and buy it (it's probably cheaper there).There are two copies. The Banner of truth will not wear and tear, it's a glued cloth hard back. But the thing is it's missing the classic Richard Muller introduction and a beginning chapter.In my opinion, it would be tough for any systematic theology work to beat this one. Again I say \"in my opinion\" the only systematic theology that would replace this one would have to be a theologian with the same level of scholarship and care as Berkhof. Someone who is Machen-like and Confessionaly Reformed (Three Forms, Westminster Standards).Why say more, the book has enough reviews. I'm just chiming in and giving this ST the five stars that it deserves so that maybe it could improve its overall 4 star status!Inwoo Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem. I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar. This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.Where do I start? First off, the font size is terrible. So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant. Then comes the print type. It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage. The printing is extremely bad. Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy. Was the typeset dirty? Did you run out of ink? True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus. But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers. That is how one presents a text of significance.If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day."

         "The Canine Good Citizen: Every Dog Can Be One (Howell Reference Books)",
         "The techniques in this book are outdated and potentially harmful. Dogs are not wolves, and have not been wolves for many thousands of years. The \"pack leader\" mentality of dog training is foolish, and forcing/holding your dog into positions to prove your dominance is counterproductive bullying at best and downright dangerous at worst. I encourage dog owners to read through/watch Sophia Yin's rebuttal of the dominance method:(...)Letting your dog eat before you sit down to dinner or letting him sleep on your bed is not going to make him aggressive or unruly. Your dog doesn't dart outside ahead of you because he thinks he's the leader... he's just excited to go outside! You don't need to win every game you play with your dog in order to \"prove\" you're better anymore than you'd win every game with your kid to show them that you're in charge- all it's going to do is make them feel crappy (who wants to play a game that they can never win?) I have two dogs that are proof of all of that.Now, true, you don't want to let your dog push you around- no blocking doors, no refusing to give up seats (mine know the command \"scootch,\" though one of them always moves automatically, even when it's not necessary. Even though I let them win games! Shocking!!) But if you have a dog with aggression problems, you have bigger issues than trying to pass the CGC test and you definitely should NOT be physically forcing them to lay down for a half hour! That's a great way to get yourself bitten.I'm sure many of the training techniques in this book work just fine, and dogs are, in general, very forgiving creatures who will let you bully them into submission (even though it's not necessary) because they want to please you. But this book and those like it are out of touch with what psychology knows about behavior. Why be inefficient and mean to your dog when you can make the experience pleasant and rewarding instead? I ordered this book and read it extremly fast that I was surprised that I got what I did from it. I entered my dog Princess and she passed!! I expected it to be a lot harder that it was (the actual test). But, best of all I have a very well behaved dog. It was the Volhards book that spurned me on to K9 search and rescue, therapy, skijoring, agility and service dog training, which I train my own dog for. Being 14 that is a lot!! Very good book. I would HIGHLY reccomend. I just received this book a few days ago, but sat down and skimmed it cover to cover. I realized a few things that we were doing with our 4 month old GSD puppy that we should change. The book was easy to understand. The drawings/images help demonstrate proper techniques. There is a great 8-week training schedule to help get any dog trained and manageable. The book also goes over the elements of how a dog is tested for the Canine Good Citizen test and ways to approach the 10 different elements to prepare him/her for the examination. Additionally, it lets you know what you can or cannot do during the test - such as constant verbal contact with the dog being acceptible and no use of food for motivation. I'm excited to start this training and hopefully get our girl her CGC certification. This book is great for training especially for a newbie to dog training. Very easy to understand how to do the basics and work from there. I recommend it highly and so do my two Havanese. Bottom line it is up to you to put in the time needed to reach the goal we have reached. It is well worth it. I knew I was in trouble when, just after purchasing this book, I found my dog eating it.Wonderful book, can't recommend it highly enough. Solid, loving, step-by-step training manual to work with your dog - not against them. Easy to understand instructions for teaching your dog to be a welcome presence in any situation. I recommend this book for those who are novice in training their dog, first time owners, and those who have been training for years and years."

It contains detailed maps of 27 auto tours \"away from the interstates\" in Iowa - into what I would call the \"real Iowa\" This book contains sites along each tour.

         "Night And Day",
         "I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was thin, action almost nonexistent--not much to it. Definitely not your typical, entertaining Robert B. Parker book. Let's face facts -- this is not a great book. The central mystery is pretty toothless, and there are a pair of subplots (one involving a principal and another the ever-lovin' Jenn) that don't have much bite either. Even the good guys are universally, sniggeringly sex-obsessed -- Jesse can't seem to have a conversation with Molly that doesn't include a reference to her one-night stand -- which makes their investigating sex crimes a bit disturbing. And Jesse does a thing or two in the line of police work that cannot be legal.On the other hand, Parker is suddenly gone. Which means that our times with Jesse, Suit, Molly and Sunny and Spike (who visit from one of Parker's other series) is now suddenly limited. So I found myself savoring the denizens of Paradise more than I would have under other circumstances.It's below average Parker, but below average Parker is better than no Parker at all. And that makes me sad. I like to read a Robert Parker novel whenever I want a book that is fast and simple to read. The characters are familiar, dialogue moves the action, and you can be distracted externally, and pick up where you leave off with ease. His books are ideal for travel: like snack food. The eighth police chief Jesse Stone novel, Night and Day, focuses on the theme of obsession. Readers know that Jesse remains obsessed with his ex-wife Jenn. After a peeping Tom in the town of Paradise increases his obsession and progresses to home invasion, molestation and then murder, Stone and his police team work to track him down. Along the lines of \"it takes one to know one,\" Stone examines the obsessive Night Hawk, as they call him, from the perspective of Stone's own obsession with Jenn. Sunny Randall and Spike make cameo appearances, as does Spenser's Susan Silverman. The pace of the novel is as quick as ever, and the dialogue is peppery. Before you know it, you'll have finished the book, the flight attendant will be announcing imminent landing, and you'll be somewhat satisfied that you didn't totally waste a boring flight doing nothing.Rating: Three-star (Recommended) LOVED IT!I love all the books in the Jesse Stone Series.This one is no exception.I just love Jesse ... Plain and Simple.I picture him as Tom Selleck while reading and I am gone.Can't wait for the new Jesse Stone movie on CBS Sunday March 1st. Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job.. Katherine Hilbery has everything - she is beautiful, well-born, intelligent, kind, reflective, sensitive, though not in a sentimental way, but... bored. She must find a purpose in life, other than being of a wealthy Chelsea family and the descendant of a famous poet, and she must choose between the weak-willed sophisticate William and the tempestuous Ralph. Though the love of the self-sacrificing suffragette Mary Datchet for Ralph and the upcoming law-clerk's failure to realise he is in thrall to Katherine provide a few twists and turns, such is in essence the plot of Night and Day.All would be well if this were the psychological drama it appears to be, set in an atmospheric turn-of-the-century London. But Virginia Woolf also pursues a political message: in this novel, women answer to male stereotypes and vice versa. The women are logical and career-minded, the men coy and romantic. This might be fine, and it makes for a few good scenes, except that it doesn't quite fit the characters. Mary's ill-starred fate seems gratuitous. Katherine's interest in mathematics is too obviously a code, never properly illustrated. And her falling in love with Ralph isn't credible - she is too good for him, and it is all too sudden. It seems Night and Day can't quite choose what it is supposed to be: psychological or social comedy. It lacks the simplicity of Woolf's first novel The Voyage Out, the wistfulness of Mrs Dalloway, or the experimental complexity of her later works. I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone novels; not this one! It was the usual Jesse and his Ex talking in circles around a peccadillo: a peeping Tom! Even in Paradise, I am sure something more interesting could happen! I will wait for the paper back next time Parker comes out with a new one. This deserves less than one star! A delightful edition of a masterpiece! Woolf was a profound writer and she stories are deep and complex. She wrote about the feelings that most of us have experienced at one time or another. This is why her work is considered by so many of her readers as something very special. Understood by women everywhere and a book that women should read at least once, its also a good book for men to read, to help understand women.To understand love, read Night and Day.Profound! Virginia Stephens Woolf (1882-1941) was born to Sir Leslie Stephens and his second wife. His first wife was one of William Makepeace Thackery's daughters. Woolf had brothers and a sister Vanessa. She was a shy, brilliant intellectual who committed suicide in 1941. She is the best known member of the Bloomsbury Group of authors/painters/poets and intellectuals who met at her home. Among this group are: Edward Morgan Forster; T.S. Eliot: Carrington; Lytton Strachey; Vanessa and Clive Bell; Duncan Grant and Virginia's husband Leonard Woolf.Virginia Woolf's first novel was \"The Voyage Out.\" She wrote diaries throughout her life as well as criticism. Woolf also spent time teaching literature to the poor. Virgnia was a liberal who had a lesbian relationship with Vita Sackville-West. She had no children.Night and Day was the second novel by young Virginia. It was published in 1919 after the author had spent several years writing it. Woolf had long periods of time when she grappled with mental health problems spending days in bed. She was carefully attended to by her husband Leonard.The Plot: The long novel deals with the love life of Katharine Hilbery and her friend Mary Datchet. The two women are very dissimilar. Katharine comes from a literary family much like the one in which Woolf grew up. Katharine is torn between love for Ralph Denham and William Rodney. Both men are attorneys. One of Katharine's relatives named Cassandra Otway also is in love with William Rodney leading to a messy triangle. Mary Datchett is attracted to Denham. She is a worker in the Women's suffrage cause in England. In the end all the love problems are resolved.The novel is rich in the use of bird imagery to describe the emotions felt by the characters. Night is symbolic of the dreamy world often inhabited by young Katharine and her Ralph Denham who holds an idealistic dream of love. Day refers to the everyday world of London life.Though the book has its boring parts it is, nevertheless, an Edwardian novel which shows the promise of a young writer who fulfilled her potential in such better books as \"Mrs Dalloway\"; \"The Waves\"; \"Orlando\" and \"To the Lighthouse.\" These later books make much more use of stream of consciousness and indirect communication among the characters.The book may be dull to many but Woolf's beautiful writing in which she describes London and the feelings of her leading characters makes this a novel of interest. A neglected gem by a great author! Another entertaining book from the hand of Robert Parker. He just keeps doing it. ZERO STARS. Everyone has read the complaints about Parker's latest works - double spacing, large fonts, one third pages, etc. Until you try one his books on audio, you do not know how bad it has gotten. I bought this book on CD's for a recent trip. I know the books had gotten shorter but you can't hide that in audio - the unabridged edition is a total of 5 discs with a spacer taking up half the box to make the box look normal size for a novel.On top of that, if you eliminated the amateur technique, you would remove 40% more of the book. Almost every line ends with \"name said\" - as in \"What do you think?\", Jesse said. \"I don't know.\", Molly said. When reading the books, your eyes can easily skip over this. When listening to it on audio, there is no way to tune it out. After less than half a disc, I have had to stop. Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Parker - I own every book he has published - but this may be the last. ROBERT B. PARKER - make an effort or hang it up - this is embarrassing. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Robert Parker's final Jesse Stone novel reflects the authors declining health before his death. Parker seems to be going through the motions. The dialogue remains witty and snappy but there is not much else. It appears that Parker was rushing to complete this novel before his death. You can skim read this in an hour or two.The plot revolves around a peeping Tom who is stalking women in Paradise plus sending notes to Police Chief Jesse Stone, saying he is going to take his obsession to the next level. Parker fans will enjoy but also will be disappointed. Unfortunately, this is the final book in the series but not the greatest. I think I've probably read everything written by Robert B. Parker. I like his pacing, his characters, his dialogue and his plots. He creates worlds of black and white and periodically it satisfies me to inhabit these worlds. I love how the mysteries unfold themselves and his ability to embrace morality without seeming cheesey. Once again, this novel made me a very happy reader.The plot for this Jesse Stone novel is easily relatable. No big time crime lords here, the story centers on quiet desperation and crossing boundaries. As always, the reader gets to witness Jesse's struggle with alcohol and women but this time, he seems to be making progress on all fronts.Robert B. Parker is in my top 5 of favorite authors and I'm already looking forward to his next novel. Fingers crossed that Private Detective Sunny Randall will be the focus of his next published effort. How can anyone not enjoy Jesse, Suit & Molly - every book is a delight. Love Jesse's humor and outlook on life - drinker or not! After the rather awfulStranger In Paradise (Jesse Stone)I was afraid the whole series was going to just fizzle.I was pleasantly surprised with \"Night and Day\". It is a return to higher standard of reading to which I had grown accustomed. The plot moves along nicely, the witty banter is plentiful. The case is distressing but not super-hero level.I will not go into all of the plot details. Those are outlined by others on the page. All in all, this is a pleasant and quick read. Everything I look for in a Parker novel - detecting, banter, psychobabble and a bit of romance (in a macho sort of way, of course). Before I jump into my review of Robert B. Parker's newest \"Jesse Stone\" novel, Night and Day, allow me to first to give a big plug for the five TV movies based on the series that Tom Selleck has produced and starred in, the most recent being Thin Ice, which was aired by CBS on Sunday, March 1st. Selleck captures the role of Jesse Stone perfectly, and each movie is a slow burn, filled with excellence on every level. If you're a fan of the novels, then you owe it to yourself to see the TV movies. Except for Thin Ice, the other four (Stone Cold, Night Passage, Death in Paradise, and Sea Change) are out on DVD. Also, CBS tends to broadcast a \"Jesse Stone\" movie every so often, so keep an eye out.Now, on to Night and Day, which is the eighth novel in the \"Jesse Stone\" series. Like the seven previous books, the small-town chief of police has to deal with three cases simultaneously, which keeps the story line moving along at a brisk pace and the reader from being bored. I probably should mention that while Jesse's attempting to solve his three cases, he's also battling his obsession with his ex-wife, Jenn, and with alcoholism, both of which are tied closely together.This time around, Jesse has to deal with a rather unusual situation that involves a female high-school principal and a panty check of the young girls going to the school dance on one particular night. The principal claims that she was only doing it to make sure the girls intended to be good and not naughty by wearing thongs and other sexy lingerie underneath their skirts. The parents of the children, however, are outraged over the act and want Jesse to do something about it. He pretty much agrees with the parents and thinks that it's definitely an invasion of privacy, but it doesn't help matters that the principal just happens to be married to the head of Boston's top law firm. Along with that problem, Jesse has to deal with a voyeur who calls himself the Night Hawk and likes to look into the windows of women as they're undressing at night. His antics soon escalate into daytime breaking & entering, not to mention home invasion, and Jesse's worried that someone may eventually get hurt during the commission of the crime. Last, but not least, a young girl approaches Jesse to complain about her swinging parents and how it's hurting the family. Jesse doesn't have a problem with consenting adults swinging, if that's what they want to do, but when children are experiencing the negative side effects in this type of behavior, he feels the need to step in and do something about it before more emotional damage is caused.The story line and pacing of Night and Day are similar to the other books in the series, and the reader doesn't really encounter anything new here. The fun of the books, however, is in getting to visit with Jesse Stone for a few hours and to see how he's doing and to find out what's happening in Paradise, Massachusetts. The reader knows going into the story that Jesse will solve the crimes in one fashion or another, but it's Jesse himself that's the big attraction. He a good man, a tough man when necessary, but he still has problems like everybody else. As a reader and fan, I want to know how's he coping with his alcoholism and with the addiction to his ex-wife. Actually, I want to see him happy and at peace with himself, which leads to one very good thing about this particular novel--private investigator Sunny Randall is back (she and Jesse decide to give it another shot), plus her best friend, Spike, is opening a new restaurant in Paradise.As with most of Mr. Parker's books, Night and Day is well written with sharp, crisp dialogue that makes the reader want to try out some of the lines at work. And, like the TV movies, the novels basically follow the saga of Jesse Stone's life to see where he's at and how he's dealing with the day-to-day challenges. I think most readers can identify with the chief of police on many levels, be it problems with the person you love, or the need to drink in order to escape the stress of everyday life.Robert B. Parker's novels are always a delight to read and certainly entertaining in every sense of the word. Night and Day is no exception, and is a wonderful addition to an already marvelous series. I'll also add that older readers tend to enjoy Jesse Stone somewhat more than the younger ones, but Robert B. Parker does have a large fan base of all ages. Coming in May, the third novel in the \"Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch\" western series. Yeeeeehaaaa!",

         "The Center of Everything : A Novel",
         "I am always looking for a good book to read, and I very rarely find one worth finishing. This book was quite the opposite; I wished it had gone on longer. It is a great book and I wish I heard about it more often, it deserves to be a best-seller. This book was wonderful. I could feel the humid air and smell the lilacs with drops of water leftover, after a rainfall. I love the way Evelyn's thoughts are so black and white. It is or it isn't. I can't wait for another great story from Moriarty. Personally, I see little to compare between Laura Moriarty's The Center of Everything and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Both are fine books but Mockingbird centers on racism in the south years before the Civil Rights movement and this book is, in my opinion, a true coming of age novel.The protagonist, Evelyn Bucknow , was born out of wedlock to a mother who does her best for her daughter until depression overtakes her when she finds herself without a job and pregnant, but unmarried, a second time. Moriarty writes with such insight that you can't help but feel the child's pain, as well as the depths of the mother's despair. In fact, you can't help but feel FOR the mother even though her actions are responsible for their endless poverty. Because of an out-of-wedlock, teen pregnancy, the path was set--a path that young Evelyn has no choice but to live and survive.I hope I haven't led you to believe Evelyn's story is depressing because it isn't. Young Evelyn is smart! She is a thinker! I recommend the book to all ages but, especially to young readers, as it has a message that is straight and true: A single mistake can change your life, so use your head and learn from others. I liked the story and how the point of view of the narrator evolves as she grows and matures. The ending was a little drab, though. I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the characters futures. I read this book in 2 days and loved every bit of it. It's definitely a must read!! I highly recommended this book to anyone. The book rec's was in good condition. Enjoyable....but I prefer non-fiction. Recommended to me by a friend. Everyone is saying this has the distinct voice of To Kill a Mockingbird and it really is very similar. The story is not really like Mockingbird but the narrative perspective is told in the same way by Evelyn Bucknow. The book covers eight years of Evelyn's adolescence--from 10 years onto her graduation from high school. Her mother is constantly trying to make ends meet financially, and she loves Evelyn deeply. There is a great schism in the family because Tina, Evelyn's mother, had her out of wedlock. Tina's parents are extreme fundamentalists that will not let her forget her past. When Tina becomes pregnant again with a married man's baby, the problems start all over again, and Evelyn's grandmother, Eileen, is the only family that will talk to them.Evelyn's brother, Samuel, is born prematurely and it is soon obvious that he is mentally handicapped. Tina's role in the book changes to constant caretaker of Samuel, and Evelyn moves into her teenage years nearly alone. Her grandmother begins taking her to church, and Evelyn finds some answers there... yet she struggles with questions when one of her favorite teachers in school, Ms. Jenkins, becomes the target of a smear campaign by the fundamentalists for teaching evolution to the children. Evelyn's struggle to decide whether to side with her grandmother and the \"nice people at the church\" or her teacher shows exactly how Evelyn is certainly in the center of everything.The Center of Everything brings together many situations that Evelyn must confront--and she is a strong girl who has a very wise voice for someone so young. I wanted to love this book. I really did. It flows nicely and I connected with the characters. I found myself really caring about what happened to them, and I even teared up a time or two. The problem? NOTHING ever happened to them. I kept reading and reading, thinking something big was about to drop, and then it was just more-- nothing. There were a couple times in which it seemed like something might be about to happen, but nope. It's just a story about any old girl from nowhere, USA, who doesn't quite fit in and doesn't know quite who she is; most of us lived that, so why would we want to read it? Plus I HATED the ending. I get that the story will be continued in future books, but I'm not interested enough to spend the time and money to read any more. I usually avoid books featuring child narrators like the plague, but when I recently picked up The Center of Everything, the writing was so winsome and Evelyn and her mother's precarious situation so compelling that I kept reading. And I'm so glad I did, because I got a lot more than I bargained for: The Center of Everything is a novel that I actively looked forward to returning to every night so I could see what the characters were up to, and toward the end I rationed out the pages so I could stay in Moriarty's Kerrville, Kansas a while longer. The character of Tina is a particular triumph; Moriarty gives her wit and warmth and shatters preconceptions about welfare mothers while remaining true to situation. Wise and compassionate and laugh-aloud funny, The Center of Everything is a book to be treasured and reread. Wonderful novel. The Center of Everything is one of those rare coming of age novels full of emotional pathos and personal growth that somehow touches a deep nerve within, especially if you were about the same age in the Reagan era 80's as protagonist Evelyn Bucknow. It is a novel about a smart girl living in a small Kansas town with her overwhelmingly depressed, trampy \"welfare queen\" mother searching for a better path in life than the path her mother chose. Told from Evelyn's perspective between the ages of 10 through 18, the first half of the novel focuses on her increasingly strained relationship with her somewhat unattentive mother. When Evelyn reaches the breaking point with her mother and \"a black line\" is drawn between them, the novel then focuses on Evelyn's fractured friendships, painfully unrequited love and her desire to improve the quality of her life. Moriarty's prose is thoughtful and breezy with a touch of child-like innocence. The characters are achingly real keeping you riveted to the page not from suspense but from a desire to get to know them better. You'll find your emotions run high as you love/hate many of the characters, especially Evelyn's mother. Touching and poignant, sad but never sappy The Center of Everything is a believable account of a girl's search for herself and her place in the world. This book ends with Evelyn standing on the porch with her special needs brother and a storm is approaching. What's that all about? Not worth the read...Very disappointed.. Everlyn Bucknow is a little girl with very little stability, but more than enough spunk to cope with her very roller coaster life. This book touched me very deeply. The terror of living so close to the edge of total poverty, that a mechanical problem with a car turns your entire world upside down. The unbelievable importance of caring and noticing teachers who can inspire a dream of a different way of life in a child. Send the kids to Grandmas for the weekend and lose yourself in this well written and inspiring book. While interesting, the story was a bit predictable and I found it to be depressing at times. Would appeal to teens. It did keep my attention; However, very depressing and it just abruptly ended. I liked the main character, Evelyn. Would not have compared it to, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;. My two year old daughter accidentally bought this book and I think it is one of the best accident to happen as of late. Is there a sequel? The book was written well but at the end there was so much that was left hanging. I very much enjoyed this book. It is a good indication of how someone that is born into poverty and faces many challenges is able to rise above it by the life choices she makes.I also had admiration for Tina, the mother. Her life choices were not good, but, she possessed a fierce love for her children.I especially admired the work she put in with her handicapped son.I would have given it five stars, but, the ending left me wanting more. Hopefully, a sequel will be written. So, if you like your books to leave you depressed, this is a great one for you. The story follows Evelyn, the daughter of an unwed mother, from fourth grade until it stops without any apparent reason just prior to her graduation from high school. The ending makes no sense - it literally just stops without warning.The author has a good grasp on writing, which is why I have given her two stars instead of the one star the book probably deserved. The author dwells only on the negative and doesn't give us any glimpse of a good thing that might have happened to Evelyn during the eight years. Death, autism, teenage pregnancy, adultery, blah, blah, blah. Evelyn rises above it but without giving us any idea how she does so.Along the journey, the author snipes at conservative politics, Reagan, Oliver North, Christianity, and any other sort of morality. Hysterically, the author dwells on Iran Contra as if it consumed thought for eight years when reality is that it was a blip on the political scene that lasted only a short time. Strange and rather boring to read about in 2011. The only interesting thing I noted from this was that while the author was trying to beat Christianity to pieces, the only truly nice people in Evelyn's life, the ones that gave without expectation of any return, were the Christians.Apart from the author's political agenda and liberal ideology slapping you across the head over and over again, the abrupt ending is a horrible disservice to a reader who waded through the morass of it all, only to be stopped without satisfaction. Because of the ending, I cannot recommend the book. I am so glad I finally read this book. I've had it laying around for the past couple years and never gave it much thought, but it turned out to be an excellent read.This is the story of Evelyn Bucknow. She lives in Kerrville, Kansas with her young mother and no father. We meet her at age 11 and follow her to her last year in high school. In that time she experiences her first love, and first heartache...the feeling of being an outsider, and the betrayal of her one true friend. She learns that young people do not in fact live forever, and she slowly realizes what she wants out of life, and how to acheive it.I highly recommend this book. Evelyn has such a voice for being so young, and her struggles through adolescence are at times both heartbreaking and joyous. I would really love to see a sequal to this book, to learn how Evelyn, her mother, her mentally retarded brother Samuel, and her beloved grandmother Eileen turn out. This was a great book, and I absolutely look forward to reading her future novels. A good book for teenagers if they can see that one's actions determine one's consequences and that this isn't just another story. Evelyn's mother has made poor choices all her life, but even in her poor choices, she's found good. One good was Evelyn, the other was her handicapped child Samuel, the result of another poor choice. But Samuel may also be what saves the mother and leads her to begin to make good choices. Evelyn's grandfather made a very poor choice when he chose to label his daughter (Evelyn's mother) with harsh words, to be a poor father, and in essence turn his back on his child. His choice led Evelyn's mother to make the choices she made. One wonders what choices someone before him made which led to the choices he made. (He was not only an awful father, but an awful husband.) \"What happened to Eileen's mouth?\" Evelyn asked her mother. \"She married my father,\" her mother answers. I loved it when Evelyn's teacher planted that seed in Evelyn's head about choices. When the book ends we know, even though it's not stated and the book just sort of ends, that Evelyn will live her life better that her mother and the difference will be in her awareness of the consequences, both for good and for bad, in making choices. I'd love to have a cup of coffee with the author, and compare notes on mothers. This book really touched me, and it's rare to find a book that can make me laugh as hard as it makes me cry. She has a wicked, clever style of narrative that kept me hooked the entire time. I enjoyed getting to know these characters. Evelyn was a complex character with many of the same feelings and questions of most teenage girls. I loved being inside her thoughts and emotions then getting to understand her reasoning and thought process. I was disappointed that the book came to an end. I wish there was a sequel so I would know how they ended up. It was a little too abrupt of an ending. I also enjoyed going back to the 80's and reliving some of my teenage years. I enjoyed this book a great deal, although others I loaned it to, found it a tad depressing. It is during the same period of time I grew up, the 80's, but in a small rural town. It is a story of a flower growing out of weeds, a young girl growing up with a single mom whom makes bad choices but is still likable and kind. Very nice touching book. I enjoyed this book, especially since I got it at such a bargain price. The character of Evelyn is very real, very familiar to anyone who was ever a teenage girl. I held back on the fifth star because of my confusion about her mother (is she crazy, is just selfish?) but the mother evolves as well, just as life does. The situations involving young love and broken hearts resonated as very true. I will read another book by this author for sure! I must comment that I love a marked down price in order to get familiar with an author! I think it is a marketing tool that is a win win! This is a coming of age story about Evelyn, a young girl with a single mother. They live in Kansas and Evelyn is a lonely and bored young girl. The character development was interesting but the plot was not. I found it slow and very drawn out. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to finish and at the end it was a disapointment. I bought this book because it looked fun and it was free. It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud at times. Being a mother of girls and also a daughter myself, I could relate to both Evelyn and her mother. As the reader I found myself rooting for Evelyn and her mother..each likeable characters in their own way. The book covers the mother/daughter relationship from Eveyln as a preadolescent who adores her mom through the alienation and breaking away of the teenage years to a time just before Evelyn leaves for college and has gainedc respect and appreciation for her mother. I especially enjoyed the fact that this book held my interest without violence, excessive profanity or dark and depressing themes. Loved this snapshot of growing up in the 80's. The characters are all either judging or being judged as they deal with the consequences of their actions. Some scenarios are hilarious when viewed from Evelyn's perspective. Even better on the second read. I loved the writer's style, and thought she captured the personality of the main character and the thoughts, feelings, and nuances of her life at each age throughout the story.Religion was a strong thread throughout and while I would have been okay with that as an underlying issue, it was a bit too strong of a secondary storyline for my tastes. I found myself wanting to skim through some of those parts to get back to the \"good stuff.\"Overall, enjoyed the book.",

Run on sentences that were also a cause of confusion. Then to really put the nail in the coffin, there are missing steps in many of the excerises leaving the reader guessing how something was done.

         "The Description & Setting volume for the Write Great Fiction series might not be the last word on these subjects, or the one book that has it all, but it provides a good overview and plenty of material for further reflection. Well worth the purchase price. Like the other \"Write Great Fiction\" books, this one focuses on the elements listed on the title, description and setting. While the criticisms some others have had are sound, this is by no means a terrible book, and certainly it is not as awful as some would make it out to be. As for the criticism that there is \"nothing new\" in the book, that's easy. The author makes the assumption (as he should, seeing as how every other good author who has ever written a non-fiction work on any given subject would do the same) that the reader knows nothing, or little about how to write descriptive passages but wants to know more, so having \"no new information\" is an empty criticism. He isn't writing his book for people who already know the concepts, he is writing for those who don't know but want to learn them. The \"nothing is new\" criticism is like a math teacher being critical towards a new math book that comes out since it offers \"nothing new.\" Obviously the math teacher already knows the concepts that are covered in the math book.But I have spent more than enough time on that. This book will teach you how to describe aspects the reader can see, hear, feel, touch and smell, thus bringing them into the story. It will teach you how little description is too little, and how much is too much. It will teach you how to get the reader to paint a mental picture of the world you create in your story. It will teach you how to apply the other aspects of writing fiction, such as plot, dialogue and character development and how they relate to description. It will teach you how to create a single sentence that is chock full of information that the reader needs to know to understand the context of your story. That is what the author intended, that is what he does, and that is why this book is worth the money. This is a practical and useful reference. Using examples from excellent writers, providing good tips for new approaches, it also gives exercises to develop techniques that make for better writing, authentic writing, more enjoyable writing. I'm glad I bought this book. I definitely use it as a reference. I wish I'd bought it when I first started writing.",

         "I was not sure I would like this book, even after seeing the high reviews it received. I finally gave it a shot, and my only disappointment was that I waited so long to read it. I LOVED it, and finished the book in 3 days. I really liked the characters and various writing styles thoughout the book. It's a beautiful story and I hope it becomes a film one day soon! Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature. This was a pretty nice read. I really enjoyed the story line. If you are a romance enthusiast you will probably like this one. This is the first historical Christian romance I've ever read, and I absolutely loved it. Deeanne Gist is going to be a star, mark my words. Witty and charming, this is a story you won't forget. Lady Constance Morrow and Drew O'Connor are wonderful characters and before the book is over, you feel as if you've known them forever. Bravo, Deeanne, and thanks for a great read! This book is awesome. I can't read it enough. The fact that they were forced to marry is just necessary for the story line, but the fact that they have some of the normal problems of a couple. Their reasons for these issues is that they won't communicate, & that they do it because they love each other. I truely enjoyed this book. I found myself crying at times and laughing out loud at others. I really enjoyed the historic realness. This is not an easy book to put down and walk away from. I do not like to read and I loved this book. Sometimes I had a hard time putting it down. It was clean, fun, and kept my interest. I am already on another book by that author. I really enjoyed this book! Although it does carry a religious message, (probably because of the nature of this time period), I think it portrayed the struggles of the new American colonists very well. I liked way the romance fits in historically. I especially liked Constance as a character. I found the ending very abrupt. I picked this up, not knowing it was a Christian historical romance, but was not sure I'd enjoy it after reading some of the reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised, even though I knew how it would end well before the end.Constance is brought to Virginia after being kidnapped on the docks, and is sold to Drew, a planter who has lost his true love and wants nothing to do with the fiery Constance. When they are married to protect the morals of the area, it's in name only and Drew promises to help her get back to England, if her story checks out. As the book progresses, the couple has to figure out if their initial dislike can turn to attraction and maybe love.My biggest issue with this is that it's a story that's been done before. There aren't any twists to the story, nothing radical, it's just a pleasant reading experience. There isn't any sex; some of the prior reviews mention how much they lust after each other, and I kept waiting to see how \"scandalous\" the relationship would get, and there was barely any mention of them making love. But I just read \"50 Shades of Grey\" and maybe I'm sexed out, because I didn't mind the lack of racy dialogue in this book.It would be nice if the author would consider going back to revisit the characters in a future book. Josh, Drew's brother, was an interesting character, worthy of his own storyline, and their sisters, Nellie and Sally, would make for fun reads. Otherwise, this is a nice book to read to pass the time. I didn't understand all of the rave reviews of this book. I found it to be very boring in places and drawn out. I understand that the author was trying to do all possible to make this book true to the time period she was writing about, however, much of the time the dialogue between the characters was hard to read..I didn't understand the reviews either that some were saying there was a lot of lust and offensive things in this book. There was nothing out of place in my opinion.I didn't hate this book, but I didn't overly enjoy it either. I would have quit reading it half way through if I didn't have to always finish what I start. If I would have just got this from the library, I would have deff quit reading it in the middle. A very engaging story . . . I was most surprised due to the fact that this was not my favorite type/catagory of book but I was not able to put it down. Gist is an outstanding author who has created a real page turner. She does not drag it out but tugs at your heart til you find your eyes flying over the pages to see what happens next! I absolutely loved the personalities and the way she leads you through their own personal spiritual struggles and victories.... this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!! I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end. American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century. Taken from her home in England against her will, Lady Constance Morrow is shipped to America, where she is to be sold to a Virginia colony farmer as a 'tobacco bride'. The daughter of an Earl, Constance is appalled by her humiliating circumstances. By an odd twist of fate, she ends up becoming the wife of Drew O'Conner, who had never intended to marry at all.Her position as a colony farmer's wife is very different from the life Constance had previously led. To Drew's increasing frustration, she has no skill with cooking and cleaning, and would rather solve mathematical equations than work. Tempers flare between both parties as they adjust to their new lifestyles. Nevertheless, though she began as a bride most begrudging, both Drew and Constance find their marriage of convenience turning into something more than either expected... Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love. Superficial christian message. I will not be reading anymore of her books. I agree with another reviewer this is soft \"christian porn\". I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I was waiting for this terrible \"lust\" to start...I didn't get it. First of all, they were married, and secondly they were married!! I don't think there is anything wrong with a man and woman being attracted to one another, especially if they are married!I never even figured out what these ladies were talking about, all I saw was an attraction, and not lust. Someone said that the characters just lusted after one another, and that there was no love...I think that the author showed the love grow...just like any marriage that starts off like theirs did, you will never have instant love, love is something that takes time. Physical attraction on the other hand can happen much sooner, which is what the author demonstrated.I really liked the book, it was easy to read. Someone else pointed out the historical inaccuracies, well that may be so, but I still enjoyed the book. I love the friction between the two main characters, it makes for an exciting and sometimes funny read! A true romance with out graphic sex! So cool. I thought it a wonderful story and fell in love with the characters! I liked the Christian over tones as well. I loved it and read it in two days.",

         "Manic Magee Diesel Hayes#8Manic Magee AKA: Jeffery Magee is a boy who lost his parents at age three years old. They died in a train crash. He ran away when he was only 7 years old. He went to live with his aunt and uncle but they always argued a lot. He wanted to live by himself but he was in the West End were the white kids were . All he wanted was to fit in with the black kids but he didn't have anyone to live with. So he made a new friend that provided a roof over his head.THE END Jerry Spinelli breaks down the stereotypes of what a \"traditional\" family should be in his novel Maniac Magee. Jeffrey Magee, (known as Maniac for some outlandish feats he performs) a strong-willed boy, uses his ingenuity to overcome adversity and find himself a home.Maniac is orphaned at three and moves in with his aunt and uncle who hate each other. Subsequently, they don't even talk to one another. After eight years of this non-existence, Maniac runs away from home. Maniac literally runs in search of a home. He becomes part of several families that he meets in the town of Two Mills. Suzanne Bunker says, \"We are not the Cleavers, we have single-families; step-families; adoptive and foster families; children raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles; gay and lesbian families; and individuals of all ages living together, unrelated biologically but still a family\" (116). The latter mirrors the situations in which Maniac finds himself. The first family with whom Maniac lives is the Beales. They are an African-American family living in the East End of Two Mills. They are a `traditional' family (mom, dad, big sister Amanda, little sister Hester and little brother Lester), and they welcome him into this family with open arms; his skin color is of no significance to the Beales. On his first night there, Maniac checks the front door of the house:number 728.Maniac has a home. He is part of a family. He loves the Beales and the East End and all the colors of the East End. \"He couldn't understand why they called themselves black ...he saw gingersnap and light fudge and dark fudge and acorn and butter rum and cinnamon and burnt orange. But they were never licorice which to him was real black\" (Spinelli 51). Unfortunately, because of his white skin, not everyone loves Maniac in the East End. Maniac feels that he has to leave his beloved Beales to protect them. He runs until he meets Grayson, a caretaker at the zoo. Grayson, an older man, takes Maniac in and gives him a home. As Suzanne Bunkers comments, this mirrors a grandparent raising the child (116). At Thanksgiving, Maniac prays, \"thank you for this warm house and our own little family\" (Spinelli 108). He goes outside and paints \"101\" on the front door, justifying their existence and their home. Sadly, Grayson dies, and once again Maniac is orphaned. Maniac runs again until he finds another family, the McNabs. This family, from the West End, consists of a drunken father and three neglected sons. Maniac feels that these children live like orphans. Maniac tries to instill right from wrong in the McNab children but wonders, \"how he could act as a father to these boys when he himself ached to be somebody's son?\" (155). This is not a good environment for Maniac. The McNabs are racist, and Maniac cannot live with them. He feels pride for the East End. He runs away from the McNabs to the zoo, until Amanda Beale comes to call him home. \"You are coming home...to sleep in your room...not here. This is not your home\"(183). Maniac is happy to go home. \"Children's literature is increasingly demonstrating that families cannot be so easily dichotomized as `traditional' or `non-traditional' and no one family is `normal', `typical', or representative of all families\" (Bunkers 128). Spinelli embraces these new types of families that mirror our culture in his novel and because of this, he is able to give a boy a home to call his own.Cited works: Spinelli,Jerry. Maniac Magee. Boston:Little, Brown and Company,1990. Bunkers, Suzanne. \"We Are Not The Cleavers\": Images of Non-traditional Families in Children's Literature\"The Lion and the Unicorn 16.1 (1992):115-133. This book is written by my favorite author - Jerry Spinelli. This book is so good that each time I read it, it gets more suspensful, fun, and there is more adventure each time. I would recommend this book to people who like suspense and action. If you like Harry Potter, you will love Maniac Magee. He's like Harry Potter, except he does it without magic. Since this book won the Newbery, I expected a good book. But it's mostly tells, not shows--a no-no for writers. The author tells just about everything. There aren't that many actual dialogue scenes between the characters. I didn't find this book interesting at all. Just because a book wins the Newbery doesn't mean it's going to be a winner. Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T. DarkBlade Upon finishing Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli, I think I love it and dislike it all at the same time. Whenever I prepare to write a review on Amazon, I like to read as many previously written reviews as possible, just to gauge where everyone else stands with the novel. It seems as though the five star reviews loved this book because of the message and plot involved. Many of the one star reviewers, though, said the book was \"boring.\"Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing kids saying that \"I wouldn't have read this book if it weren't assigned in school.\" I dislike seeing kids being forced to read a certain book, because it may turn them off to further reading at a crucial age. Since this book has received the reputable Newbery Award some time ago, interest in it is higher than usual. However, as I said with Kira-Kira, PLEASE don't blindly assign children to read award winning books simply because they are on some list. Just because they have won these fantastic awards, doesn't mean they're for everybody.This book intends to tell the story of racial prejudice. Jerry Spinelli usually tackles some interesting issues in his stories, and Maniac Magee is no exception. The storyline itself is compelling and charming and some of the characters are very likeable, particularly Grayson, Amanda and her family. There were so many characters in this book though, that it was easy to get them mixed up.I know a few people who love the work of Jerry Spinelli and enthusiastically promote his work. As a result I decided to check out some of his novels. Spinelli writes in such a quirky way that one would find either off-putting or fantastic. I think I'm somewhere in between. While I love the fact that his novels are unique and unusual, I can see how children could find his writing difficult to read at times. He doesn't always flow smoothly and uses a very unusual style to describe something. He's not your typical author, that's for sure.This book is recommended for ages 8 through 12. Usually children like to read a book whose characters are older than they are. Spinelli's characters are usually rather young and would naturally attract a younger audience. However, the way that he writes may be too difficult for such a young audience. I was a bright kid, but honestly I think a lot of this novel would have gone over my head if I read it at age 8, simply because the reader has to read between the lines a great deal of the time with this book and my capabilities of doing that at age 8 were limited at best. If I know I would have struggled with it, I know there are other children out there who would do the same. This is not to say that ALL children would not understand this book, but there will be some. Well, I am now a true fan of Spinelli's first I read Stargirl and now this wonderful tale. In a way he reminds me of John Steinbeck, both have this organic quality to their writing. You know these characters they are writing about aren't real, but at the same time you instantly feel like these are people you could look up from the page of your book and meet--the feel like people you already know. Which is amazing. Clearly Spinelli is in the right line of work.Maniac Magee has the same tall tale feel to it that Stargirl does. The world he plays in is a little bigger than hers, but both are loved and hated in very similar ways. He also refuses to see a persons faults and instead only focuses on their worth.Overall the book is sending a message about racisim, and how it really doesn't make sense, but there are other lessons througout the book. Which is really impressive because even for a book at this age level it isn't that long. Each chapter is only a few pages long which gives the reader the same feeling of running that Maniac Magee does throughout the entire book.No wonder school kids are always having to read this for some class or another. Its a book that tackles serious subjects but in a way that is not heavy handed and at times light hearted.Great great book!one last thought--ironic isn't it, how he is always running, like he's in a race and the book is about racisim? interesting play on words Spinelli does there. I thought the book was boring. Maniac's parents died in a P and W trolley falling off a bridge because the driver was drunk.After Maniac heard the news,he stayed with his aunt and uncle.He ran away because his aunt and uncle annoyed him because they had seperate things and they never talk to each other.As he ran, he spoted the ball park.At the end,he realizes that life is not a game.This book made me think about running from problems. I am using this book with my students. They seem to enjoy the book, and enjoy discussing Jeffery (Maniac). I feel that the characters are well developed which in turn brings out the problems with the two sides of the new town. We read a book dealing with prejudious and racism last year. Therefore, I felt using a book that was in the same vein, but taking a different tatic on the subject would also be good. I like a book that keeps the students interest. Also it makes it good for comprehension, and it will lead to some writing assignments as well. Maniac Magee was an excellent book with a moral.Maniac's parents die from an accident, so Maniac is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Maniac decides to run away from the both of them, leaving Maniac homeless. In Maniac's city, all the black people were on the East Side and all the white people were on the West Side. Maniac goes and lives with new friend's that he meets, both on the East Side and on the West Side. No one is to onto the opposite \"Side\" unless that person works there. Blacks on one side, whites on the other. Maniac has many fantastic talents. He can run super, super fast, untie a know that measures over three blocks long when finally undone, and many others. The moral of this story is: don't judge people by their skin color.Maniac Magee is over all, a great book! I recommend this book to all ages! This is what I thouthg of the book: it was so-so. This book was about a little boy who lst his parents when he was a little boy so when he found out he had to go live with his Aunt Dot and his Uncle Dan On is Aunt and Uncle did not get along because they had to do stuff seperley so Maniac ran away and lived with his friend and he made new friends.This book made me think of who it whould fill with out my mom and bad,and how it will fill if I had to live with Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan. So this is what i thouth of the book. Although I've always been a fan of Jerry Spinelli's writing, this is definitely his best work. Warning: If you're looking for plot summary, read the standard amazon review, 'cause I don't want to repeat it.It's amazing how Spinelli has managed to take an issue as touchy as racial prejudice and managed to present it in a way that is not only understandable, but very realistic...Spinelli writes with a style that not only tells the story of a poor orphaned kid with famous - nay, legendary - abilities, but also provokes thought on many other issues, including racism, death, seperation, and many other scary but real issues in the lives of America's youth.I've read this book numerous times over the course of my life, and as I've gotten older (6 years or so have passed since I first read it), I still appreciate the message and story told by this book. My whole family (2 grown ups and a twelve year old) enjoyed this one. A really good story, one you don't want to put down. Best of all, it is infused with a message of tolerance that doesn't preach. Perfect for 5th and 6th graders. As a kid, this book drew me in quickly. It is fast paced and fun, and \"Maniac\" lives the life every little boy wishes he could. But to read the whole novel is not to want to stay young... Jeffrey learns about responsibility, and maturity, and how to love the unloveable. The book teaches us that home is a place of love and healing and growth, not a place where people look similar. I fell in love with this book in third grade, but it might be a bit more suitable for the 5th-7th grade level, or a fairly advanced reader of a younger age. Maniac Magee is a wonderful book. It was great, Once I started reading it I was hooked for the rest of the book. I liked how Maniac even though he was small he could do things that other bigger kids didn't. It gave a chance for the short people to be better than everybody else at something. It is about a boy orphand when he was only three years old. He is sent to live with his closest relatives. He can't stand them. His relatives argued a lot and stopped talking to each other. He Loves to run, he better at things than any other kid and he prooves it. It shows that even thought he is good at everything he has feelings too. I really liked it, I will tell everybody I know to read this book. It is intended for mainly teenagers. From the Beales to Earl Grayson. This kid is a legend. Maniac in my point of view is he is a kind-hearted kid, who always takes your breath away. I wish the story never had to end. I also take Maniac as a diamond in the rough. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do. I gave this wonderful story a five star rating. Thank you for your time.- Secret Reader I think the book Maniac Magee is a great book by Jerry Spinell. He really explained alot of things in detail. It is a very funny and exciting book! I really liked the wayManaic Magee wasn't scared of anyone and he could make friends with anyone. My favorite part was when Manaic hit the frog fling home run. I think that the way people were willing to help manaic out and be there for him shows the good side of our world. Amanda was a great charctor because she was helpful in everyway. I know that this book shows how people can help each other and how the blacks and whites can work together. I would recommend this book to any one that might have probles with different colored skin that can understand how to work there prprobles out. Or to just a young teen that is looking for a good book to read. I know I love this bookbecause I have read it more than once and I hope you will too. The character in this story is Maniac Magee, but his name isn't really Maniac Magee. when he was born, he was known as Jeffrey Lionel Magee. His parnets died nad that's when his life changed and so did his name.the best known thing that Maniac or \"Jeffrey \" Magee is known for is for what he did for the kids from the east side and those from the west side. But there still a puzzeling question. Whyndid he help those kids and why was he near those areas. If you want to find out more go to your local libary and check it out. You'll never know what will surprise you.",

         "The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))",
         "It is very easy to see why this novel is a classic, i do not know about other people conclusions but for me it shows simply that our own mind is a very hard judge for us, humans; and that our natural behavior hardly ever gonna live up to our mind expectations. This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde. It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \"wanted\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could. The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process. Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt. Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book. You are supposed to hate most of the characters. Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards. This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant. Cheers The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust. arrived in good shape; classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time. The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull. This book makes for a good read. :) Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain. Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\"The picture of Dorian Gray\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work. This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \"successful\". With this Annotated and Uncensored Edition of Wilde's book, we have its history and definitive text. The Contents:General IntroductionTextual IntroductionTHE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYTextual NotesAppendix A: Accidental Changes Introduced into the Text by J. M. Stoddart or His AssociatesAppendix B: The 1891 Preface to THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYNotes of Wilde EditionsFurther ReadingThe annotations are in-depth, fascinating and informative, reflecting the era in which the novel was spawned, aspects of Wilde's biography, &c.; Illustrations are plentiful and superb, with many in color, illustrations from the book, photographs of Oscar Wilde and his chums and lovers and enemies, various pictorial representations of the book's title character, and many of Aubrey Beardsley's irreverent illustration for SALOME.I enjoy the novel as a novel. It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition. I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner. Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path. Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read. It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic. loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot.I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?\" he asked, looking at her across the table. \"A great many, I fear,\" she cried. \"Then commit them over again,\" he said gravely. \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\" Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.Punctuality is the thief of time.Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure.You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.Anybody can be good in the country.To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing. A tale of corruption and a cynic man are the eesence of the story that has captivated generations. Read it. When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an `immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a `spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray. It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \"expressing,\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \"let it all hang out.\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \"as easy and graceful as ever.\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \"the end of the century\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO- The Picture of Dorian Grayby Oscar WildeOriginally Published in 1890.Grade: B+Roughly, this novel can be cataloged as a \"Transgressional Fiction.\" A main character, Dorian Gray, leads a hedonistic life, believing that a life serving senses and beauty is the most ideal way to lead one. The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that `Ugliness is the only reality.'\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that `All art is quite useless\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled `useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \"All art is quite useless,\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called `Aesthetic Movement,\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\"\"`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\"\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\"\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"To define is to limit.\"\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\"\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth. Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many. The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read. I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side. This book is a classic for a reason, and this particular edition is excellent because there are notes and explanations as well as discussions of the trials of Wilde for indecency. I found it fascinating and thought-provoking. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially those interested in historical cultures. One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in `The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age. The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \"preaches\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people. The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \"portrait\" in our minds as well. I knew the story and had seen the films but never read the book. Worth while read of a classic. I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \"off the rails\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book. Dorian Gray realizes in the winter of his life that he has been deceived by hedonistic philosophies of Lord Henry and thereafter he succumbs to the depravity of his lifestyle. The unadulterated pursuit of pleasure leaves every man desperately empty. Oh that Dorian would have sought the Lord Jesus who will remake a man despite his past. This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece. Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. . The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \"curse\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time. The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \"must-read.\" this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short. The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy My mother had recommended this book to me awhile ago, saying though she'd never read it, I'd probably like it. I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \"Importance of Being Earnest.\" And his \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away! There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading. This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. I had heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, I knew what it was about, but I never imagined it was going to be such a good book. At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \"revealing\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far. I have read this book in my AP English class in high school and this is be far on my top 5 favorite books and an easy read. What can you say? This book was as good when I read it this time as it was when I read it twenty years ago. Oscar has it going on with this one. The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing. This is a great classical novel. I enjoyed it very much and I am certainly looking forward to keep reading Wilde's works. Excellent book! A classic. I read this in high school and did not pay to close attention to the details and the wisdom surrounding this story, but now that I have lived a few more years it makes so much more sense.... This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\" Oscar Wilde never disappoints. His plays are amazing & so is his only novel, \"The picture of dorian gray\". This is one of my favorite classics novels. Wilde's vivid details captured my intrest from the very first page. The characters were well developed, the ending was great. Overall, this is a must read book! It has everything from suspense, romance, drama, to art. I would definitely have to read it again sometime. Maybe it'll be the first book I ever re-read. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy! Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. I thought it was good, I don't know why people are saying it was boring. Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think. I have read the book and realy enjoyed it. I also have the DVD of it. You realy must get both. I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one. Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye! Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up. This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out. While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \"phew\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic. I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral! Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book. Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \"tragic ending\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be. As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic. Hello? The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities. The writing style was absolutely maddening!The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \"classic\")After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore. Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying. Bottom line: Boooooooooooooring! First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Wow...I had been under the impression prior to reading the novel that this was one of the great works of Western Literature in the past 200 or so years...Never have I been so dissapointed. While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf... Wilde gives us fabulous quotes and a delicious hedonistic storyline, with as always a sence of humor - pleasure to read. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing.

Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman Excellent read of classic literature.

I truly great read and a classic that has stood the test of time. The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator. Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading. Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall. I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \"Penguin\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \"Pocket Book\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \"Japanese effect\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap. I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read! I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read. Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through... Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also. This was a great book chalk full of meaning. I liked how Dorian had both good and bad influences about him, yet he succumbed to one and destroyed the other. This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. The novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life. I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young. This book is simply amazing. It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read. This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of `relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of those stories that your supposed to and not supposed to read at the same time. You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting. All the great reviews speak for themself! It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book! This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate. I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point. Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading. Wonderful book; vanity is a terrible thing. Read this book, the classics are worth reading especially when you don't have to. The preface is missing which is a critical to the book! Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise! Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended. I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift. When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic and amazing. I have read this about three times already and still enjoy every minute of it although the hints of homosexuality kind of through me off. This free classic version for my Kindle was very good! It's the first Oscar Wilde tale I have read and I found it to be reader-friendly, engrossing and surprising at the end. Rich characters, nice flow and if you don't know anything about the story I think you'll be having a hard time putting this one down. I've heard the name of topic brought up enough in life to recognize the title but was blessed with no spoilers being laid out and I was surprised at how engrossed I was with this read. I usually am weary about picking up classics because i don't like to get lost in the language but Mr. Wilde is clear and concise in his descriptions and His characters were very personable and interesting.I say READ IT! READ IT NOW! This was so intersting you do not want want to put down, very much a book you can get lost into Beyond just the text, this edition gives a wonderful overview into the full cultural context of Oscar Wilde's original work, and all the influences that resulted in its changes. First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \"yearly re-read\" shelf for certain. First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. A book for all time. This is a piece we could all use to search the places in our souls that need careful review and study. Probably Oscar Wilde's greatest work that continues to live on. Oscar Wilde's only novel is, in my opinion, his greatest work. While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be. The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \"musings\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read. What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned. This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...) The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail fortwo years. He left England and moved to France where he died at avery young age. What a loss? I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought. It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT. The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel. It is a tale of moral decadence and debauchery. Dorian seems consumed in his self portarit, his love for himself is so big that he cannot see beyond his image and when his true image dawns on him he dies. However i did not give him five stars because of the way the plot moves. It is a little bit slow and only at the end you feel it taking full force. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? In the course of his career Oscar Wilde, an Irish writer and poet known for his epigrams and more notably as one of the most popular playwrights in London in the late 1800's, wrote only one solitary novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \"beauty for beauty's sake\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy. This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else. While the plot and subplots take many twists and turns, they are easy to follow. The uncanny &#34;ability&#34; of the portrait is very intriguing. Watch the movie after reading the novel.",

         "I found Process Mastering to be a very valuable resource. The book is well written and straight forward in describing how to develop a process master.In my field of information technology (IT), it is critical for progam designers to have a baseline of how a program presently works. This is best done by a representative team of end users. I have found process mastering the most economical and efficient way to get a document that describes the current system. By doing a process master the team becomes empowered to improve the present process without the IT people and to know what else they want or need IT to do for them. Additionally, the team becomes more effective in their participation in the joint application development (JAD) with the IT folks.The philosophy behind the approach is very empowering to employees since it is they, the people who do the work, who develop the process masters. I am also pleased with the emphasis that the book puts on understanding the needs of internal and external customers.Finally, I can recommend this book to anyone who has processes they want to improve and who sees the value of engaging the energy, thought and commitment of their employees to do it. This book, this process, is truly liberating even to the extent of giving meaning and value to previously mundane work.",

         "From Russia, With Love",
         "Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are certainly not the mixed bag that the films are, but some are certainly better than others. From Russia with Love is, along with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, among the best.From Russia with Love starts off on a different foot than most of the other Bond novels. Bond himself doesn't appear until part two, 95 pages into the story. Until then, the story centers on the deadly operatives of SMERSH, Soviet Russia's spy-killing organization. It's this first part that sets up the main plot of the story--a Russian scheme not only to assassinate James Bond, but to do so in a way that will scandalize the English public and shame the Secret Service. One of the more famous Bond girls, young Tatiana Romanova is suckered into posing as \"bait\" for Bond, and unbeknownst to her, both she and Bond are set up to die at the hands of Irish psychopath Red Grant.With those pieces in place, the plot proceeds methodically from point A to point B. Fleming was never a master plotter, but that's not the point. Having all the parts set up and ready for action generates enormous suspense--when, for instance, is the serial-killing Grant going to make his inevitable and violent appearance? Even for those who have seen the film version, there's plenty here to surprise and lots of white-knuckle thriller chases, fights, bombings, and near-misses.The book does have flaws. Bond is a bit too obtuse and more of a pawn than usual, and Tania is just a bit too wide-eyed and innocent, which I suppose is the point. But the book moves so briskly from the opening setup through the building suspense and action that one hardly has time to criticize the characters--the world is moving just as fast for them.From Russia with Love is one of Fleming's best not only because of his signature pace and action, but because, in this novel, he takes the time to develop menacing villains and show us, before Bond ever steps onstage, just how dangerous they are. The androgynous Rosa Klebb and giant, moon-crazed Red Grant are well-developed and certainly among the best of Bond villains.On a final note, upon reading this novel have Doctor No, the book's immediate sequel, on hand, because Fleming's ending is so abrupt and laden with ambiguity that you'll want to jump right into the next book. This is either a weakness or a strength. I'll go with strength.Highly recommended. As I watched the last 007 movie I couldn't help but want more....quick read now I want more James Bond. Fully one-half of the way through \"From Russia With Love\", by Ian Fleming, the reader awaits the first action scene - related to the main theme of the book, the nasty spy intrigues and assassinations of the Cold War. How \"007\" and Fleming got their images and reputations from this book is beyond me.Yes, during the first half of the book there is a brilliantly executed build-up, a plenitude (too much perhaps?) of minute detail (especially the faces of the characters), and promises or hints of something more (hopefully some action or intrigue) to come.The classic, 1950's-1960's settings in Moscow, London & Istanbul are fun to read. Since I visited each of those cities in the very early 1960's, I was amused and pleased at the accurate depictions.As Bond and the fem fatale Tanya depart Istanbul on the Orient Express, the pace picks up, thankfully. Actually for the first 80% of the story, the hero and main character is MI5's Istanbul officer Kerim, a Turk. Up to that point, Bond is a minor character, strangely nave, notably uncertain, and only an eager, bumbling follower.For the most part, except for many oft-repeated pet phrases, it's well-written, this story. Bond improved in the last 20% of the story, becoming somewhat the \"Bond, James Bond\" we know from all those movies. It is possible that the movies (which we have all seen at least 4 times) gave us a truly false picture of 007?All-in-all, Bond, as a cold war spy, disappoints through almost all of the story as a mistake-prone, super nave, very gullible and ineffective officer the realm. One must endure the book for the denouement scene on the train. The final few pages are almost laughable and quite unsatisfying.I give it a weak 3.00 on Amazon's scale, if only out of respect for Fleming's body of work and as a thank you for creating the character of James Bond. But make no mistake, \"From Russia with Love\" is wholly disappointing. This is the first Bond book that I have read, and I have to say that it wasn't a very good first impression.Bond spends the majority of the book. He is talked about, and he watches the action happen around him. Towards the end of the book he finally becomes somewhat active, however he misses every clue that he is given. WHen the bad guy finally makes an appearence - after sooo much was told about him at the start of the book, his entire history - he only spends a short amount of time in the action of the book. He reveals the entire plan to Bond, and then is of course killed by Bond. Not because Bond is super cool, but because Bond is super lucky.Of course the woman, the \"heroine\" spends the entire book either making love to Bond or sleeping, but I never expected anything more.Overall, I'm not sure what the appeal of Bond is, but maybe as a friend suggested, I picked the worst one out of the Bond books. I find nothing wrong with formulaic spy books, but this was bad. Oh yes, those beautiful Russian girls and their decoders can really tie you into knots. Isn't that right Mr. James Bond? From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight. Fleming does a great job introducing us to all of the characters in this novel. Like the movie this novel allows us to see Bond as a secret agent, not a superman saving the world. A must read for all Bond Movie fans. This is one of my favorite James Bond books. I read it as a child and I recently repurchased it for the Kindle to reread it. I still own all of the original paperback books but they are so fragile that I am afraid to read them as I fear they may come unbound.I liked this book a lot because of the detailed plot by SMERSH and their plans to entrap Bond and kill him. The assassin is a master killer with a devious and detailed plan to complete his mission. I won't ruin the story for you but you probably already know it from reading the book before or watching the movie.I think that Ian Fleming was at his best writing when he wrote this book. I feel that in his mind the Bond character was fully developed as well as the hated of the Russians for Bond who always seemed to be able to thwart their devious plans with his skills. This story is solid and well written with love, romance, murder, trickery and suspense in it. I truly enjoyed this story and it is one of my favorites. If you are a James Bond and Ian Fleming fan then this is a must read for you. Even the ending is dramatic! From Russia, with Love has a great plot and is well written. Fleming has a great way of portraying his characters. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I read it twice.",

         "Jane Eyre (New Windmill)",
         "Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \"fairy tale\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \"blindness\" in the novel. First, he is \"blind\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \"plain\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \"stuck in the mud\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic. This was fun as a romance novel, without the really steamy parts! It is always interesting to read books that were written before electricity. The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies. This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics. I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!! Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though. Jane&iexcl;s courage, self-respect and independent helps her towards to her life and overcome all the difficulties, finally obtain her life and her true love. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down even for a second.I loved the writing style and the depth of the characters. I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \"mad wife in the attic\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \"hero\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \"Jane Eyre\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\"Jane Eyre\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester. This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist. This book surprised me not having pages long descriptions of nature and place, which I like. The story is exciting, eventful and sends a great message about love, respect and God. I really enjoyed it... also because it is written in beautiful old English. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. horrible book specially bcuz the language was weird. i remcommend this book to old fashioned people. la la la la Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel. (...) This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (\"manly\" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The \"I heard your voice in the wind\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century! Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!! it is true that many would consider the language in here outdated. I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts. i had no problems with my order and it was delivered very quickly. thank you. i will be looking here first when i need to order books next semester This was an adorable little book that was very affordable. I loved the look and antique feel. The book mark was also a nice touch. I read this book years ago and wanted to read it again. I couldn't remember much about the story. I really enjoyed it, even though some of the language of that time was hard to follow at times. I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \"classic\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \"quick read\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there. Although I would consider Jane Eyre herself plain I definitely would not consider this novel that. This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \"Amphigorey,\" among others. There weren't so many as to be distracting; only enough to make you anticipate one as the story reached an important turning point. Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a bit of contemporary art with their classic lit. Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read. I chose the book for a school project and was honestly not expecting to enjoy the read. I was pleasantly surprised to find a book that was relatable and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down. No well-read person should miss out on this classic. Completely has no detectable flaws in my point of view. Totally seems like the writer is a great writer. :) I had always wanted to read this after seeing the old movie from before I was born (I'm 59). It tells so much more of Jane Eyre's life a as a young girl. It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years. Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style. This book misrepresents itself. We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \"Peek inside\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear. I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \"coincidences\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey. Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature. Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book. Enjoyed this book so much. Very readable and engaging.It may have been written long ago, but is still enjoyable. I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud. I have always wanted to read the classics. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel. Although this book's words are quite hard to understand, the plot of this story is amazing. I am only 13 years old but I enjoyed this book loads. I recommend it!!!!!!!!! I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . . I absolutely loved this book. Jane's character is one that you just keep pulling for because you genuinely care what happens to her. She has a strong will and is the type of protagonist that I find inspiring. Although this is by no means a quick, light read I think that if you're a fan of the classics this is one that you need to add to your \"must read\" list. I look forward to rereading it!

And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \"Jane Eyre\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story. This is my favorite book. The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque. I've read it 4 times and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Always want to change what happens...and always imagine a healed Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \"Reader, I married him\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.' I'd been wanting to read Jane Eyre for quite some time. I even had a copy in my possession. The problem was that it was a boring edition. I couldn't get into it.All that changed when I saw this illustrated version on a shelf. The feel was amazing; the pages, the illustrations, the text-- everything came to life.I definitely recommend this edition to any Jane Eyre fans or those simply wishing for livelier way to enjoy this novel. I'm hoping she does more illustrated editions in the future. Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \"syrupy-ness\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while. Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \"passionate\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \"coincidences\" which might have been classed as \"providence\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \"coincidences\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop. I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte. I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, `Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes. This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over. Jane Eyre has been my favorite novel since I was 12 years old and every single time I read it again it just gets better and better. If you like reading good mysteries, biographies, and romance than Jane Eyre is your book. Charlotte Bronte spectacularly captures the emotions and feelings of the characters and creates a strong and independent lead.It's just wonderful, amazing, and the best book I've ever read.What are you doing reading this... you should have downloaded Jane Eyre and started reading it already. I bought this book because I was interested in the author after being compared with her in my own writing. first person is not the way I write, but Charlotte Bronte did a great job and the book is a good read. I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience! I read this book as a teenager and enjoyed it. As an adult I love it.If you like historical romantic fiction you will enjoy Jane Eyre. JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\" This is a classic love story that you can't go wrong with. Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts. In many ways, `Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of `good' over `evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote `Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith Jane Eyre is a great classic novel. It was a pleasure to re-read it after many years.Would highly recommend. 4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \"The Eyre Affair\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :) I did not realize the \"collector's library\" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read. I have only seen the movie and I find much to my delight that th book far surpasses Hollywood's version. I can not believe that I never even considered taking the time. Now I intend to read as many of the classics as I can. Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius! Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful. The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!! I first read this in college, and didn't fully appreciate it at the time. But I have since read it several other times, and it has become a treasured favorite. An old classic that I had largely forgotten. I enjoy the words that are no longer used and the chance with the kindle to look up definitions easily. I read Wuthering Heights in high school and loved it, but never read any more of the Bronte sisters. Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \"busy\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!! I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story. I am 14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre). all the review's here say \"ooo u can't appreciate this as a teenager\". u know what??? i'm a YOUNG teen, and i can appreciate the romance in this story. the only thing is... idk it's heart wrenching in some parts but other parts its just... boring! i was forced to read this for a book report. whoever thinks we don't understand the romance then ur wrong because today's teenagers grow up quickly what w/ all the media and etc. we do understand. we might not take it as seriously but we do understand it. don't diss us and say this book is too difficult for us. my teacher would not have recommended this it us if she thought we were too ignorant to understand it. This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too. My emotions were all of the place with this book. I consisted of well placed imagery and overall events. I believe I actually cried a few times, especially towards the end. I'm can truly and honestly say that I loved this book and I'm glad I had to read it for my AP English class. Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book. You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status. How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book. This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre. I had to read this for English and its my new favorite high school book. I highly suggest it, mainly for girls. Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \"Jane Eyre\" doesn't come close to \"Wuthering Heights,\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written. &#34;I am a free person...&#34; I love this book. This had not been the first time I had read the book but definately different especially since it was the first time that I read it in digital format for the first time. Through this book I found out that I like the digital format; definitely not better than paper but nice on the train. I bought this book to try to relate to old classic books but it was boring and I didn't even finish it. But that is just me and I don't like these types of books, but it was free, and you might like it, so it can't hurt. brave jane, my favorite of the first person heroines. not a beauty - thank god, isnt that a relief! - but plain and puny and with an indomitable spirit. she chooses morality, in a line which i cant forget: \"and there i plant my foot.\" For rules are not made for when times are easy, or to be discarded when they are inconvenient, but are there as a lifesaver for when emotions and life are in disarray. Great book, a real page turner. After reading many of Jane Austens novels I was told to try the Bronte sisters and it was definitely worth it!! This classic is witty and thought provoking. The plot is twisty enough to entertain the most experienced reader; you may guess the ending but not the path to it. Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition, Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \"Wuthereing Heights\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read. first read Jane Eyre when I was fifteen. It was such a wonderful joy to my then teenage mind full of dreams of love one day.Rereading it every now and then it takes on new understanding each timeThe language would be difficult for teens today (no lol or texting talk!!) But I hope some will try-it is a very good storyAll in all I loved it all over again!! This is my favorite love story ever and it's the third time I've read it. As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids. I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story. Got it to give as a valentines gift, but ended up keeping it! Very beautiful. Classic When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again. I loved Jayne Eyre as a young girl and read it many times but had not tried it as an adult. It turned out to be just as captivating for me now as it was then. Loved the insights in Charlotte's writing. It was such a pleasure to read and I was sad when I came to the end but not sad about the way it ended. Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it. A true classic! Well worth the read. If you are tired of modern novels with too much sex and violence try reading the classics Jane Eyre is a great place to start. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties. Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults. This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre. I love Barnes and Nobles Classics books. The quality of these books are very nice. I will continue to buy them. I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males. Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like. It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I have been passionate about Jane Eyre for going on twenty years now. It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \"martyrdom\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever. The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back. I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \"classics,\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name) It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then. For all you out there who aren't very big fans of classical literature, I assure you that this book will not disappoint. This is a beautiful love story that isn't too hard to understand as far as classic books go, and is well worth the effort. I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not. I am 41 years old and have read this book four times, about once a decade. An absolute must read for anyone who loves serious reading, and sorry, Jane Austen, but Charlotte Bronte rocks the house in ways you never could! i normally dont go for the books that take alot of thinking but this book is now one of my favorites. it is a perfect combination of romance and mystery. for sure a great read i highly recomend! Have wanted to read Jane Eyre for a long time. Have found the novel worth the time as well as in the populist and feminist perspectives. Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99. Though this makes skipping back easy when your listening to it in the car, it might reek havoc on your MP3 player. The box is thin cardboard, and the CD's come in thin paper sleeves. If you haven't read it, you're in for a quiet explosion. Just think about when Bronte wrote this and wonder where...WHERE...in the world did this woman get all of her insight? I cannot recommend this enough. I have several copies of this novel & it's one of my favorites of all time. I will read & re-read always. \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \"Gone with the Wind\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \"Wuthering Heights\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light* I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story! I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures... I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest. I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly. This is my all time favorite read! The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!! It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter.

Definitely a must-read. I am not much of a reader. I waited 58 years to read this book. It is my daughter's favorite book and I finally read it at her urging. Well it is wonderful. The story has so many twists and turns and is so well told. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I read it on my phone and appreciate being able to read the Kindle version free. Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine. The novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is a timeless story of an orphaned girl. The story of Jane Eyre begins with a look into her unpleasant life while living with her cruel aunt and cousins. To escape her family, Jane escapes to a school in which she spends eight years. Upon leaving Lowood, Jane decides to better her life by becoming a governess. She takes this position at a place called Thornfield Hall where she teaches a young girl named Adele.This novel is well interpreted to show the struggles of an orphaned girl. It also demonstrates how much courage a woman can have in their life even though things may seem impossible.This book is likely to appeal to an older age group. The language is difficult to understand at times and younger people may have trouble staying interested just because the novel is extremely descriptive. An older age group would probably have enough patience to let the splendor of the story unfold. It's also a longer story of 456 pages in which really could have been written well in half the length. Though there were a few minor changes in this version, it definitely does not alter the spirit of the great narrative, nor does it inhibit the reader's comprehension. Given the fact that it is a free edition, this is a fantastic vessel toward familiarity with a true classic. This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane. This book is a great book for those that love stories about love, duty, and the Victorian era. I loved Jane Eyre's character because it was the typical heroine from this time in British History. She is dutiful and proper despite her low circumstances. I love Victorian novels because they always have a happy ending! I LOVE this edition! It has so many helpful explanations in the back - it's a fantastic work of a beautiful, beautiful book. I have several copies - this is my favorite - hands-down.My only criticism is the ribbon - it unravels too easily. Bind the end of it so it doesn't do that. If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school! So glad I re-read this classic. Reading it 40 years after the first time opened my eyes to aspects of history and the beauty of this classic that I didn't see the first time. I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book. Thios book has meaning suprizing twist and turn. It makes you feel sorry for Jane everything that happens to her. Charlotte wrote this book as if she were Jane. It simply amazing. It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!! This is a very ssuspensefull and emotionally enrapturing book. I suggest it to anyone looking to read a great book.God Bless ~Amy Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)",

         "Crossing: A Memoir",
         "This is the story of one Donald McCloskey, a biological male who went on to become a full transsexual. He is now a transsexual as well as a widely published economist. I learned a lot from this memoir about the life of a transsexual who started out as a married, heterosexual cross-dresser. He erotically cross-dressed before becoming a transsexual.I was hoping for a more theoretical framework. For example, there is NO mention of the major kinds of transsexuality. There is absolutely NO mention whatsoever of autogynephilia or of homosexual transsexuality for that matter. None. I also wondered about Deirdre's sexual life post-operatively, as I am sure other readers did.I liked the photographs of Don and Deirde both pre- and post-operatively.The narrative is a little hard to read because of all the bold face, mixed with regular face. I think this was meant to emphasize McCloskey's transsexual verus heterosexuality identity.Despite the book's inherent limitations, I would recommend McCloskey's interesing memoir to anyone seriously interested in transsexuality. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone looking for a more formal treatment of either autogynephilia or homosexual transsexuality. I found Deirdre's memoir refreshing, honest, and insightful, as well as humorous. Deirdre is not an author who takes her self too seriously, though dealing with personal experiances that are both serious and painful.Her story brought back memories of my childhood. My mother was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic and institutionalized when I was 7 years old.I highly recommend this book. It does have some &quot;mild profanities&quot; such as &quot;jeez&quot; and &quot;God&quot; (used litely in the beginning, but it turns into a heart felt prayer) I was utterly fascinated by the author's transformation. At the start of the book we meet Donald McCloskey, a noted economist, as well as husband, father, and professor. We also learn that he is a compulsive cross dresser who walks around casually in women's clothing and heavy make up--at home. In his 50s, Donald had a major life epiphany and decided to become a transsexual. He has \"the works\"---breast implants, electrolysis, facial feminization, female voice surgery, and sex reassignment surgery. The results are evident in the photographs (before and after) in the center section of the book. \"Deidre\" is a tall, blond, large-boned transsexual. Arms folded, legs crossed, \"Deirdre\" is not exactly my image of the womanly ideal. But judge for yourself.I found the author's literary style a bit unnerving. All those bold \"thoughts\" made me wonder who was speaking---Donald or Deirdre the Transsexual? American jokes often begin with &quot;You know that someone or something is ... if ...&quot; and the list goes on. I will not build up such a list on McCloskey's book, (anyway, I do not try to be funny either) but rather give you one personal reason why I loved it.The author, at first, convinces you that her crossing is truly a &quot;state of being&quot; and not what most of us would take as some sort of obscure fantasy. The reader is then &quot;sympathetic&quot; to her in the very first meaning of the word: I understand and I suffer with you, especially as things go wrong with her surgeries and with her family.But here come the mixed feelings: is she not responsible for being rejected by her wife and her children? For instance, was she not expecting too much from her daughter when signing &quot;Deirdre and Dad&quot; at the end of one letter ? Was &quot;Dad&quot; only not more appropriate to show that her new physical appearance changed nothing about the love she has for her daughter?At the end, the reader cannot help but ask himself where would he likely stands in all this and long after finishing the book he would think and think over it again. As for me, this is a sure way to recognize &quot;a great book&quot;.Finally, the book is well written and it is hard to skip a single page when you put both your mind and your feelings into it, which is surprisingly easy once you began to read it. This is a great read. There aren't many trannsexual memoirs as honest and riveting as McCloskey's whirlwind tour, from married heterosexual to avowed transsexual.My main complaint is straightforward. This memoir does not elaborate on contemporary scientific theories on the origins of transseuxality. Odd for a book that purports to be part memoir, part social science. I was hoping to find more information on autogynephilia--either an affirmation or denunciation of the concept. Where does McCloskey stand on this subject? He writes about gender as if it were disconnected from sex. How true is this in real life?Despite the book's inherent limitations, it's a great read and suitable for a general readership.",

I may not be ready to say goodbye to meat for good but my views have changed profoundly. Thank you Dr. Campbell for putting this together. Dr. Campbell has done a magnificent job documenting his findings. It's irrefutable--animal products in the diet are risky for your health; you can eat just as well with a predominantly vegetable diet. Whole foods versus supplements? No contest--whole foods win. This book forwards a recommendation for a non-obsessive change to a whole approach to nutrition. The benefits: reduced/no heart disease, diabetes, MS, cancer, macular degeneration, osteoporosis. Hey what else is there!Have I followed the recommendations? Yes, and it was easy. I've become a \"flexitarian\" (I still eat a little meat occasionally). I'm an old man (68), and I really want to stay healthy; since I already love whole vegetables, fruit, and grains, why not go for it!Unfortunately, none of my friends or family were as excited about this as I. I can't live for them! If the book looks daunting, just read the first section on cancer, just that section. If you don't get pulled in, then best wishes.Campbell only becomes preachy at the very end of the book. But hey! I can take it; the first part overwhelmingly makes up for it. I'll get back with you in ten years and let you know how I've been doing. For some dimension, see also \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" and \"Food Rules,\" both by Michael Pollan. Great books. Related info, but not the same.I also realized that there is something about this in the Bible. See Daniel: the story of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, as they opt for vegetables rather than rich delicacies in the King's court. It's a must-read and I think, even if you don't buy into its startling conclusions, the reduction of meat and dairy in favor of whole plant foods is without serious controversy a good thing.Want I wanted the book to address:(1) How animal protein differ from vegetable proteins(2) What is it about those differences which lead to such profound differences in results(3) What does evolutionary biology have to say about this, for example, differences between predators and herbivores This book has completely changed my life, following the dietary guidelines put forth in this book helped me lose 60lbs in the last 16 months. I no longer eat processed foods, or animal products, this book gave me the education to know why I should not eat those foods. 16 months later I'm a changed man and it all started with this book. Read it like your life depends on it, because it does. After reading this book I highly suggest picking up \"Eat to Live\" by Dr. Joel Furhman.Eat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss As the sub-title suggests, this is truly is the most comprehensive review of hundreds of scientifically obtained results ever compiled in laymen's terms. Author T. Colin Campbell, himself a research scientist with impeccable creds, has put forth irrefutable evidence that diet has the greatest influence on health of any other factors by far. This is a very readable book, not a medical tomb, and it leads the reader down Campbell's own difficult path to these conclusions during a time when almost no one wanted to hear about it.I \"tested the water\", buying the eBook version first just to see if I could get my head around it and have since bought several paperbound and one hard cover to distribute to others. Though convenient in an e-reader, you'll want this book in your permanent library. It is just too important to trust to technology. It will change how you live, it could save your life. I think this book will end up hurting the human struggle, though I do believe Campbell means well, and he is an intelligent man to be sure. Selective bias works in all of us, including myself certainly, but then I did not write a book stating that any amount of cholesterol is unhealthy in our diets and presenting it as if it were scientifically supported.I would suggest to all to read Gary Taubes' excellent book \"Good Calories Bad Calories\" for a much more scientific and cited discussion of food and human health as it pertains to cholesterol, saturated fat, and their implications in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. Amazingly well cited, with a 180 page bibliography.As one who has been into the health movement since I was a little kid, being macrobiotic, vegetarian, vegan, raw-foodist, and now omnivorous, I can say that reading Weston Price's opus titled Nutrition and Physical Degeneration changed my life. I don't believe there is one human diet, but I must concede that even though initially a vegan diet made me feel great, I now believe firmly that it took me a while to recover from that period of my life, especially from yeast problems and adrenal issues created by all those whole grains and fiber. High fat diet is the key for me, I definitely know that now. It seems the original monograph of the china study supports that too, arguably. Well written and loaded with so much information. Why do so many people (worldwide) have their eyes closed to what they put in their stomachs? The China Study offers compelling evidence, based both on laboratory research and a huge epidemiological study in China, for being a vegan. Dr Campbell is a renowned long time research scientist at Cornell who is not given to exaggeration or jumping on bandwagons. He did not become a vegan himself until late in his career after looking at both the laboratory research and epidemiological evidence from China and seeing how much they both led to the same conclusion: animal protein is bad for your health. His book is written for the lay person but has extensive references to support his statements. My wife and I became vegans after reading The China Study and have found it surprisingly easy to maintain. Prior to becoming vegans we ate what is considered a normal American diet. In terms of reducing the cost of health care in this country, which is crucial if this country is to maintain its leadership role in the world and if we are to have the money needed to improve our education system, infrastructure, health care system, maintain our military, etc, veganism on a mass scale would greatly reduce health care costs which would free up money to do these other things. The China Study was the largest, most comprehensive human nutrition study in history. The China Study was the culmination of a 20 year partnership between Cornell University, Oxford University and the Chinese Academy Of Preventative Medicine. It is the legacy of Dr. T. Colin Campbell.Dr. T Colin Campbell ( 1934 - ) grew up on a dairy farm in Northern Virginia. For about 50 years Dr. Campbell has been at the forefront of nutrition research. Dr. Campbell is a Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University. Dr. Campbell has received more than 70 grant years of peer reviewed research funding. He has authored more than 300 research papers and received the Research Achievement Award in 1998 from the American Institute of Cancer Research.Dr. Campbell opens, his book, \"The China Study\" by telling us that the top killers of Americans are ( in descending order, page 16 ):1. Cardiovascular disease2. Cancer3. Medical Care4. Cerebrovascular Diseases (strokes)5. Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases6. Accidents7. Diabetes Mellitus8. Influenza and Pneumonia9. Alzheimer's DiseaseThe population of the United States is about 300 million people. Out of those 300 million Americans 82% have at least 1 risk factor for heart disease. Over 280,000 Americans died from strokes, diabetes or Altzeimer's Disease in the year 2000. During any given week 50% - 80% of Americans take at least one medication or one prescription drug. 65% of Americans are overweight and 31% of Americans are obese ( page 346 ).People can't be kept in a cages, so nutrition studies on human beings are both rare and valuable. They are incredibly valuable because animals are not people. What works/doesn't work for common lab animals ( rats, rabbits, mice, etc..) often doesn't/does work for human beings.The China Study had the huge advantage of being done in China, where for the most part, even in the present day, people don't move around much. They will live in the same area and eat the same diet for most of their lives. Composed of distinct cultures with different economic advantages, regional diets in China will vary greatly.Dr. Campbell found that Chinese people who live in regions that eat diets similar to Americans die in much the same ways and numbers that Americans do.Dr. Campbell also found that Chinese people who lived in regions where animal products are scarce ( i.e. 4 ounces of meat a day, 3 - 4 thin slices of cold cuts ) did not experience the terminal diseases that Americans do in anywhere near the same numbers. Even when attempting to adjust for physical activity.The message of Dr. Campbell's book, \"The China Study\", is that if you want to avoid dying and more importantly suffering from, the list of diseases above eat a plant based diet of whole plant foods.I like to read about nutrition, so the nuts and bolts of the book that other people might find interesting I did not and vice-versa.The first thing I found interesting in this book, is the list of the top killers of Americans. I have seen that list many times over many years. Never with item number 3 on it. According to Dr. Campbell physician error, medication error, hospital borne infections and adverse events from drugs or surgery kill 225,400 Americans a year( page 15 ). Reads like a good argument for getting serious about preventative self health care doesn't it? Exactly Dr. Campbell's pointThe other points I found interesting were in regards low carbohydrate diets. Many of the proponents of low carbohydrate diets have the near-conspiracy theory idea that low fat diets recommended by the scientific establishment only served to make American's fatter. In Dr. Campbell's own words ( page 95 ):========================\"One of the fundamental arguments at the beginning of most low carbohydrate, high-protein diet books is that America has been wallowing in low-fat mania at the advice of experts for the past twenty years, but there is one inconvenient fact that is consistently ignored: according to a report summarizing government food statistics, \"Americans consumed thirteen pounds more fats and oils per person in 1997 than in 1970, up from 52.6 to 65.6 pounds.\" It is true that we have had a trend toward consuming fewer of our total calories as fat, when considered as a percentage, but that's only because we have outpaced our gorging on fat by gorging on sugary junk food. Simply by looking at the numbers, anybody can see that America has not adopted the \"low-fat\" experiment-- not by an stretch of the imagination.\"=========================In other words, Americans as a whole, were never on a low fat diet. Americans are fatter now because Americans have been eating more calories overall. Again, nothing new. You can read the same information in more detail in the August 2004 edition of The National Geographic (pages 46 - 61), \"Why are Americans so fat\" by Cathy Newman ( not quoted in this book ).My primary complaint with this book is the title. A more accurate title would have been \"What I have learned during my 50 year career of nutrition research\". The actual \"China Study\" takes up a chunk of the book, but only a chunk.I would have enjoyed reading more about the actual \"China Study\".The bulk of the book is taken up by Dr. Campbell trying to demonstrate that the idea that animal products bring disease and that whole food plant based diets bring health is not a new scientific discovery. In fact, he claims it goes back at least 30 - 40 years.Why haven't you heard of this before? Well, that is the title of Part IV of his book, the last 92 pages or so.Do not expect a typical hippie health food conspiracy theory rant about payoffs and evil plots. Dr. Campbell has been one of the top researchers in the U.S. for about half a century. Many of the scientists and officials he has criticism for he knows on a first name basis. Dr. Campbell gives the reader, instead, a very sophisticated account of how health information does not make it out to the average person and more importantly, how seemingly conflicting medical information ends up in the popular media. Reading this section of the book will give you a valuable perspective on how to view reports on any given study you might find in the news.Since I waited so long to read this book, I have read many popular criticisms of it.As a popular reader, I haven't come across any critics with Dr. Campbell's credentials, who have addressed a fraction of the over 730 references of this book, who have read all of his research or who are involved in the same research as he was. I'm not saying that such scholarly papers aren't there, but that is not where I have seen the bulk of criticism coming from.Some of the popular criticisms of this book are flat out ridiculous. For example, that Dr. Campbell wrote this book because he is a vegetarian and in league with animal rights activists. These \"critics\" have never read this book or they would have seen this quote (page 107 )=====================\"The results of this study, in addition to a mountain of supporting research, some of it my own and some of it from other scientists, convinced me to turn my dietary lifestyle around.I stopped eating meat fifteen years ago, and I stopped eating almost all animal-based foods, including dairy, within the past six to eight years, except on very rare occasions. My cholesterol has dropped, even as I've aged; I am more physically fit now than when I was twenty-five; and I am forty-five pounds lighter now than I was when I was thirty years old. I am now at a ideal weight for my height.\"=============================Furthermore, Dr. Campbell describes animal experiments he conducted and defends those experiments. That is something of an anathema to almost every kind of animal rights ideology.None of what Dr. Campbell has to say is all that new. A number of well credentialed experts over the years have been saying pretty much similar things. The entire book could be successfully condemned by the critics ( far from happening ) but the main message would still stand.Eating a plant based diet of whole plant foods promotes health, eating a diet high in animal products brings disease.I do think the book takes on too much and doesn't walk the reader through enough tight conclusions. I think some parts of it could have been shorter without losing any information. I also think some parts were much too dense.I do think from the perspective of the full content of this book, that this book is one of the most valuable books any American can read.Putting the message into practice in your life can save your life and make you a happier person while you are living it.This book is old enough to be in many library systems, as well as used book venues. The only thing to lose, besides early diminishing health, is a few afternoons of your time to read this book.It is worth it. By the time I completed the first two chapters of \"The China Study,\" I felt compelled to cut most animal products out of my diet. By the time I finished the book, my diet had completely changed for the better. I feel better, look better and have more energy than ever. I now own 3 copies of the book and will start giving them to friends and family. If you know someone who eats terribly and their diet is effecting their health, I recommend you get them this life changing, eye-opening book. good book.... eating healthy and exercising is truly the answer.... there are no shortcuts... I have to eat right cause I am always on the road traveling... for you travelers out there, OMG, see this site: ThanksAgain.com Tremendously comprehensive. Having been a vegetarian for about 20 years, my health is excellent (I'm in my 70's and on no meds, etc) but I learned a lot. I had been told that Americans ate too much protein, expecially animal protein, and this substantialed that. I am now becoming more vegan since I know I don't need to eat eggs. However, I am sure I'll eat an occasional cookie with eggs in them, etc. I have sent info from this book to other family members and will gladly buy them a copy if they would be willing to read it. This is a book EVERYONE should read. The thing that irritated me most in the whole book is the arrogance of the doctors and scientists who say, \"Oh, people don't want to hear that,\" then withhold the information. (Some of us do want to hear the truth.) I am certain that people do not want to hear \"You have cancer,\" but that does not keep those same doctors from telling them they have the disease! My wife & I are reading this very heavily researched, detailed & convincing book. We've read other health oriented books dealing w/ the nutients & digestion/assimulation of food. I would add that knowing how to eat & when to drink water is a life saving aspect of overall health renewal & maintenance.G & A King Everyone needs to have this information. People have to save themselves and stop relying on the medical industry to do it. We all have the power to make better food choices that will improve our health and vitality. The information presented gives so many compelling reasons to wake up and smell the manure (stop eating animal based foods)! I wish I would have been open to this information when I was younger, but at least I can steer my 6 year old in the right direction.We are transitioning to a whole food plant based diet and incorporating more physical activity into our lifestyles. I was very happy to see that this book looked like I had just picked it up from the bookstore shelf. Excellent condidion. I was also empressed with the quick delivery. I honestly believe the author's connection between animal protein and the diseases of the developed world (heart disease/cancer/diabetes) is the most important nutritiional issue ever suggested. As an example, historically all other nutritionalists and doctors have erroneously connected fat with high cholesterol levels (at least in my case). The author correctly connected the protein of animals with cholesterol levels and my cholesterol level went down 50 points. Read this book; it can save your life. This book should be mandatory reading for every thinking individual in the USA! The meat industry, the dairy industry and the poultry industry (including the egg producers) are poisoning the population for the sake of money!! Even Bill Clinton who is a Rhodes Scholar is now vegan because of this and other information he has researched.TAKE THE TIME TO SAVE YOUR LIFE FROM CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND OTHER NASTY DISEASES AND READ THE BOOK. DO NOT IGNORE THE TRUTH BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE YOUR HABITS!! YOUR LIFE IS AT STAKE!!! Back in the 1980s, T. Colin Campbell and a team of researchers traveled to China to survey the dietary habits of 6,500 adults in 130 rural villages. Although they gathered data on a whopping 367 food variables,they somehow neglected to note how much soy people were eating. Yet soy is widely reputed to be a \"miracle food\" and the reason that the Chinese have lower rates of some cancers and other chronic diseases. So it's \"startling\" indeed to find that ALL legume consumption came to a grand total of only 12 grams per day, which is NOT very much. However, what's truly \"startling\" about this book is not the researchers' failure to be \"comprehensive\" -- they gathered plenty of good data though readers will have to go to earlier publications to get it -- but the many ways Campbell massages, misuses and misreports that data. Although he clearly thinks that it's all for a good cause, this is a textbook case of \"Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics.\" I recommend that the publisher follow up with a sequel -- a companion volume in which researchers without any dietary agenda take the same data and reach statistically justified conclusions. Now that would give readers food for thought! A lot of us grow up with biases, social and intellectual. I read this book with an open mind, as someone who was not particularly health conscious, eating all kinds of foods and exercising whenever I felt like it.There is a an ancient Chinese proverb: It says \"To know and not to do is not to know.\" This is how I approached this book -- I put it to the test. I'm 32 years old, I lost roughly 40 pounds within a year, sleep much better now, my chronic chest pains vanished with three months, I've become more self-aware as a person, all as a result of moving to a plant-based, whole foods diet. OIf you are looking to lose weight only, this book is not for you. But if you are looking to get healthy and live healthy, this book is highly recommended.PS. I've noticed a reader, M.K. Reiner, has been posting a link, [...] in reply to several reviews to debunk or discredit the book.The author of this book, T. Colin Campbell, has posted an exhaustive reply. You can find it here: [...] I honestly believe that The China Study is one of the most important books of our time. We have been so wrong with how we think of nutrition. Dr. Campbell is blazing a hard trail through years of misinformation. At some point we will have to look around at the obesity, diabetes, cancer & heart disease rates and realize that we really did get nutrition wrong. But its not too late to learn. I have turned my life around by incorporating Dr. Campbell's teachings. My mother has eliminated her arthritis just by changing her diet. My father lost his big American belly and even his hair grew back. (Seriously! Its the best side effect of healthy eating he could have ever imagined!) Change can be hard. But this information is real and compelling enough to get you to begin to change.READ THIS BOOK! Excellent book with great references and material you'll go back to time and time again. A great way to re-enforce your health and a nutrition plan that will endure for a lifetime. Recommend it without a doubt to anyone that is concerned about their health. The most comprehensive study I have ever read on nutrition and the co-relation between that which we eat and the ails that afflict us. It was convincing enough to cause a major change in my diet. The result after the first 3 month was most impressive causing me to feel my fittest and strongest. I simply eliminated meat and milk from my diet with occasional fish and cheese as alternative when eating in places where the menu simply does not have good choices. I had no weight problem and did not decrease my new diet. In fact I increased my intake with lots of fruits and vegetables. The end result was a drop of 12 lbs, which I never even knew I had as extra fat. It was the great catalizer for me and my health. \"The China Study\", by T. Colin Campbell and Thomas Campbell, is a science book written by a scientist and his son. The title was chosen by the publisher, and is a little off the mark, since only one chapter of the 18 is about the study done in China. If I were to give a title to the book, I would name it \"Macronutrients and Diseases of Affluence: a Scientific Autobiography\". The book is important for anyone interested in what science has to say about diet and disease, or interested in what a scientist with long experience has to say about the way science is conducted and the way most of us get our information that is supposedly based on science.The book has the impact that books have that are written by someone forced to change his or her mind about something really important, purely by the force of evidence. In order to get right to that impact, and the feel of the book as a science book, I recommend skipping all the prefatory material and starting on page 4 of the introduction. The book does have a conclusion, and a few pages after page 4, we do get to that conclusion, but by that time we will have seen enough of Campbell's story to be gripped by it--and not, perhaps, turned off by a conclusion, not yet supported, against which we may have our own prejudices.Colin Campbell grew up on a dairy farm, became an effective establishment scientist, isolated previously unknown cancer-causing agents, taught courses to pre-med students in which he \"lament[ed] the views of vegetarians\", and became involved in a public health project in the Philippines designed to bring better nutrition to children. Better nutrition primarily meant adequate protein--according to Campbell's own background and apparently universal consensus.The Philippine children had another problem. A very high number of them were developing liver cancer, thought to be caused by aflatoxin, a mold toxin. Then came the surprise: it was the children who were the best nourished, the children of the wealthiest families, that were getting the cancer. Campbell doesn't say whether this strange fact sent him digging in the literature, or whether he uncovered by more routine or accidental means a study done in India:In this study, aflatoxin was administered to rats. Then the rats were fed a diet of either 20% protein or 5% protein. The study reported that the rats fed the 20% protein diet ALL developed liver cancer; NONE of the rats fed the 5% protein diet developed cancer. Campbell states, \"This information countered everything I had been taught.\" It caused him to focus his career on the \"role of nutrition, especially protein, in the development of cancer.\"What he and his students and colleagues found in his own laboratory at Cornell confirmed the results of the Indian study. He states, \"In fact, dietary protein proved to be so powerful in its effect that we could turn on and off cancer growth simply by changing the level consumed. ... But that's not all. ... Casein, which makes up 87% of cow's milk protein promoted all stages of the cancer process.\" Proteins that \"did not promote cancer, even at high levels of intake ... were from plants, including wheat and soy.\"A hypothetical theory of why this might be so suggests itself to me. We humans are creatures consisting largely of red \"meats\". The common perception that meat is a good source of protein is very accurate. Red meat is indeed high-quality protein. Red meat cells from animals probably contain close to perfect amounts of all the nutrients useful for our own red meat cells. It makes it easy for the body's cells to reproduce--and it makes it easy for cancer cells to reproduce. The hypotheses are (1) that as food stuffs get further removed from our own mammalian stuff, the body needs to work harder to make human stuff from the food, (2) the body is better at doing this than are cancer cells, and (3) the body competes better than cancer cells for scarce (5% protein) resources.I inject this hypothetical theory here to forestall potential critics of Campbell: \"Campbell is saying protein is bad, but we all know the body needs good protein. Campbell is a heretic.\" If Campbell is a heretic, then the orthodoxy needs to change, because Campbell is only reporting good science. (He doesn't get into hypothetical theories--like mine above.) In fact, the data that such critics start from is sound: animal protein is good--perhaps too good and too abundant. Campbell deserves to be read--not dismissed. He needs to be read especially by anyone responsible for anyone else's health: parents, public health officials, physicians, and so on. Has opened our eyes to the benefits of a plant based diet with reference to scientific papers that back up the arguments. A very good book, and a very clear message: You are what you eat.This book is simply a must read for anyone who consumes food, period.Read it or keep believing what the powerful food lobbies and pharmaceutical industries wants us to believe: That all is find and dandy with the way you eat and live as long as you pop a couple of pills and undergo surgery every once in a while, while suffering a downward spiral of life quality and lifespan.Reading some of the comments here on Amazon of the people who gave only 1 star I can only come to the rational conclusion that they are deep deep in the pocked of the food and pharma lobbies. Just like the scientist and politics that once refuted the dangers of smoking. The raw data that this book is based upon is hard to get. Unfortunately, it appears that the Drs. Campbell have an agenda, and left out the information that contradicted the results they wanted. They left out the bit where the consumption of wheat correlated to a 65% increase in the chance of CVD. It also ignored entire counties like the Tuoli whose high meat and dairy consumption along with very little plant based foods lead to heath comparable to the more vegan counties.A more complete critique can be found here: [...] The authors should be ashamed of themselves. LONG-TERM LIFESTYLE TO BE HEALTHY BASED ON THE NEW NUTRIENT AND SCIENTIFIC PARADIGM.THIS IS THE MOST SCIENTIFIC APPRAOCH RESEARCH EVER DONE BASED IN HUMAN RESEARCH. This was a very good book on understanding how one should eat. It made for interesting reading. Anyone interested in their health sould read this book This was a fantastic book. The facts were presented in a way that made them clear and understandable. The author seemed not only highly knowledgeable on the subject but a genuine human being who cares for the health and well being of others. I read the book in a quick hurry. I tried the diet for a month or so. Then I went back to routine. But, I did lose weight and will go back to it again. Dr. Campbell lays out a great deal of information on diet and nutrition and their relationship with disease and health, making it clear that we should be eating unprocessed plant foods and why. He also goes to some length to shed light on why and how we've been fed so much disinformation by the dairy, meat, and drug cartells in America, and how they're keeping us fat and sick on their bad food, while profiting from the drugs that they sell us to \"make us better\". The strongest aspects of Colin's book are 1) the depth and duration of The China Study itself and 2) that he cites numerous studies to support his conclusions, and 3) his extensive credentials, exposure to the health machine and experience. In an age of crises, of media blitz campaigns both written and in that ominous Cloud where all data on everything and everyone is stored and available for dissecting, this volume THE CHINA STUDY by Doctors Campbell is fresh and illuminating. Early on in this tome we read, `'Hippocrates said, `There are, in effect, two things: to know and to believe one knows. To know is science. To believe on e knows is ignorance.' And what follows in this book is a close examination or scrutiny of nutrition and how it affects health and disease.Though the book is lengthy and dense it is surprisingly easy to read and understand. The Campbells wade through the various obsessions about weight control that come from (on the positive side) nutritionists and health gurus, to companies who are involved in the `health industry' with such plans as prepared meals for dieting, groups who gather like AA clones in the often lost battle to get thin, to `scientific articles' that take a small study and show us why we should avoid certain foods only to bow out within a year or so having found another wayward dietary measure that guarantees health, etc. This book shows how the growing epidemic of obesity in this country has nurtured Medicine Man Wagons who play on the fear of overweight citizens in order to make money - the big culprits being the food industry - and encouraged those lobbyists who pester the national government to foster communication for the good of corporate greed and not for the health of the citizenry.But politics aside (and that is a big part of the message in this study) the main message here is to alter our perception of what foods are healthy and how we can so easily change our eating habits by depending on plants and whole foods instead of animals as our food source. No, this is not a treatise on vegetarianism. Instead this is an explanation about how our preference for animal products (`protein source') is a misconception that has foster the persistent proliferation of cancer, cardiovascular disease, the effect on early aging, obesity, diabetes, and other malfunctions of the human organism. It is an eye-opening study that is certain to benefit all those who commit to the time to read it. At least the reader will be informed as to the misconceptions that the obesity epidemic has fostered. From that point, the progress is up to us. `Eating the right way not only prevents disease but also generates health and a sense of well-being, both physically and mentally.' Grady Harp, February 13 Maybe the answer to our health care costs is a change in dietary choices. Dr. Campbell has studied nutrition and its effect on health for decades. This is a must read for anyone interested in maintaining good health throughout his or her lifetime. This book is well written and a very interesting read. We chose to become vegans nine months ago, and haven't regretted it for a minute. If you are considering changing your dietary habits this book will help you with that decision. It's nice to finally see someone standing up against big business for our health. At the end of the day we just want to make a choice based on true facts. The title of the book is too simple to attract anyone's attention...but the book contains very revealing information about diet research...I am amazed that such a book is published actually.....It is a must for anyone who is in the health industry...I read it, I heard it and then I re- read it again.....to understand all of what is stated in it...just get your copy now..and see how your life changes for ever. Although the style is a bit rough at times, the greater message should come across clearly. The science is superb, the study is eye-opening, and the message should be taken, \"as seriously as a heart attack.\"Since reading this book I have dropped my 3 cholesterol drugs (Lipitor, Niacin, and Zetia), lost ten pounds, and feel fresher and more energized. Read this book 1 year ago and it still sticks. I was very excited to see the documentary \"Forks Over Knives\" come out so that I can recommend this to my \"non-reading\" friends!For those who are still skeptical after reading this, the works of the following individuals might help:Dr McDougall of Northern CA.Dr Lederman of Exalus Health in LA.Dr Caldwell Esselstyn from Cleveland Clinic.As a RN I can assure you that culturally we lead a very unhealthy lifestyle. With all the advances in technology one would think that we would be healthier then ever, however the opposite is indeed true. With our healthcare financial deficits, I hope to see people grasping change and becoming accountable for their health and this book gives a lot of great knowledge of why to do so! This is an amazing book, and its almost a crime that the solid research that the author presents in layman's terms isn't common knowledge in our society. Easy and interesting to read, extremely convincing evidence against the overuse of animals in our diet, and inspirational enough to make a life-long carnivore rethink about what sort of food he fuels his body with! I found this an informative book and it supports many othersources I have read re diet and disease. I would recommend this as essential reading for all people who are interested in alternative practices and prevention of disease. Epideimiology studies bring to our attention hard to ignore patterns and trends. The China Study is the most significant book on nutrition I have ever read. What a life changing revelation. I have purchased several and given them to friends. I highly recommend The China Study! This book is a real eye-opener; explaining the negative health implications of following the Western Diet. Just look around and notice all the health and weight problems in the USA. This book reveals documented studies of health problems related to nutrition and should be required reading for everyone; school children to adults, if we are ever going to attain long-term good health. This book was originally gifted to me by a friend who said, \"Vickie, once you read this book, you will become vegetarian.\" I purposely did not read the book as the holiday season was on the horizon and I wanted to make my coveted calzones. Well, the holidays passed and I read the book which to my surprise generated a personal epiphany and yes, I did become a vegetarian, taking my husband with me. I have since gifted the book to several friends, including my personal physician. Four years later, I'm still forever grateful to my friend and to Dr. Campble. This book is a must read and a life saver to whom ever is willing to take the journey. This is a must read for anybody interesting in their health. It's all based on scientific studies, not anecdotal evidence. Despite its scientific nature, it reads very well. A+ This book is a meticulous, transparent analysis of the relationship between nutrition and disease. It is written in terms that are very easy to understand and draws support from research conducted all over the world. A friend recommended this book to me 5 months ago, and since I read it I've ordered 23 copies for the people I care about.The book deals with the diseases that so regularly take the lives of the ones we love, and provides information that empowers the reader to take preventative control over his or her health that may preclude protracted, expensive, or fatal bouts with diseases such as diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, macular degeneration, multiple schlerosis, Alzheimers, arthritis, kidney stones, osteoperosis and others. It is a ground-breaking book with revolutionary implications for health and well-being.My father has a history of coronary disease and had been living at high risk of future heart problems. He worked as a doctor for 30 years and read this book with great scrutiny, but was thoroughly convinced by what he read and impressed by the quality of the sources cited. He became a vegan after reading the book two months ago. Since that time his cholesterol has gone down 50 points and he has lost 15 pounds! The father of a good friend of mine has seen similar results after adopting a vegan diet, losing 20 pounds and dropping 40 cholesterol points in one month!I'm very excited about the potential of this book and look very forward to the changes it may bring about in our culture and the health of our nation.-Brian Jordan This book contains life-saving information which I wish everyone would read and take to heart. The health problems of the Western world are no mystery. If you're interested in being healthy, and if you care about the health of your friends and family members, put the life-saving information in this book to work for you today. If you were ever looking for affirmation for a vegan lifestyle - I certainly found it in this book. Lots of data and informative. I have wanted to create a vegetarian household for years; however, my husband has been a staunch meat-eater. This book and a trip to the doctor to discover he has developed an auto-immune condition and he's agreed to a 12-week vegetarian trial. I know the power of not eating animal products and am excited to get my husband on board. If it weren't for the common sense, scientific, non-biased results expressed in this book, I never would have been able to convince my optometrist husband that diet is likely the culprit. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I was told that I have cancer, but I will not take the standard treatments. A doctor told me to read the China Study. It has change my life for the better. I feel better almost every day. I have been following its guidance for about a month now. I had a large tumor removed from my small intestines two months ago. I did a whole body detox with a juice after leaving the hospital and then found the China Study. I feel great, every one should read it. I think that this book is a very important one that more people should be reading. I came across many people who were negative about this book, but weren't quite sure what exactly it was about. I would encourage everyone to read, ponder and decide on their own, and not just listen to popular opinion.The research is presented and discussed, somewhat dryly, but in a thorough manner. The reason I gave it 4 versus 5 stars is because I still had some questions following its completion, that I feel should've been answered by the book.Yes, it advocates a plant based diet, or veganism. Yes, I personally find the science to be valid. I am also a vegan at this time, but I do wonder if there isn't room for small amounts of meat as I would think would be in primitive diets?I just dislike thinking that the authors view the public as not quite smart enough to 'get it,' and instead of a thought out approach with the use of small amounts of meat as I would think they use in rural China (the groups studied) they advocate the complete absence of all meat and animal products.Again, it is a very important book that I am currently reading to my children so that they have a modern, updated understanding of nutrition. Eye opening for insight into medical care people. All doctors should be taught ab out its findings in med school. eat mostly plant proteins, lots of fiber, complex carbs, keep out sugars, and take out animal fats. there are 368 pages of variations and research to support this. health issues or not, the suggestions are the same. read it if you need scientific data. Dr. Campbell documents the methods and findings of the prestigious China study, and points out what he feels is the relationship between a diet containing too much animal protein and disease. A chapter or two is devoted to the history of research regarding animal protein's (casein presumably from cow milk cheese) affect on tumor growth rate, providing corroborative evidence for the findings of the China study. There is also discussion on the difficulty of making this information \"heard\" in Washington due to special-interest lobbies. In my opinion the book is interesting, helpful, and motivational reading.However, the people in the healthy areas of China were likely eating a natural diet very low in refined food and tran-fats, similar to their primitive ancestors. I understand that many researchers have written that modern diseases such as constipation, arthritis, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and etc. were never found in primitive people, regardless of the content of animal fat and protein in their diet.With regard to the studies with mice and tumor growth, I wonder if animal proteins other than cow milk casein, would cause the same effect. I also can't help but wonder what other factors were different between the areas with the highest rates of cancer and the lowest, besides the consumption of \"animal protein\".I would venture to guess that if one could duplicate the details of the diet of the rural Chinese it would be a healthful thing. However, I feel it is doubtful that most people's implementation of veganism, using grocery-store foods, would result in such great improvement. BTW, it is my understanding that the rural Chinese traditionally ate a diet of rice and vegetables, some fruit, a little meat or fish, and no dairy at all, and certainly no trans-fats or MSG or the like. That I think is a healthy diet. Physicians, nutritionists, dietitians, parents, everyone needs to read this book. This is the best source of no-nonsense nutrition information that explains the relationship between diet and chronic disease, completely referenced. Definitely READ THIS BOOK! This book contains life-saving insights into what should be the everyday concerns of each one of us. To many it will make uncomfortable reading, because it addresses a number of home truths which, in order to make any significant difference, require the reader to respond by changing his lifestyle and eating habits drastically.It is a welcome confirmation of information known in outline from other sources, and it gives a wealth of educational details about food and drink and their effect on our bodies. All those with questions about why the present generation has such problems with obesity and the concomitant lifestyle diseases that accompany modern living compared with the relative simplicity of the past and its accompanying dearth of horrible diseases needs to read this book and take its message to heart. It is regrettable that not many will even care to consider its life-saving contents. Absolutely wonderful, easy to read, full of information, book. I didn't feel so passionately about a book for a long time.Absolutely \"must\" in any home which prizes good nutrition.Kira Levy, Naturopath As with other books on this subject, it did not address the specific issues that I was really interested in, although it has helped my brother, who suffered from aggressive prostate cancer. So, on that count, I can say that if Cancer is something that is relative to the issue, buy it. It couldn't hurt. This book changed my life -- I am a Breast Cancer Survivor. The science and data behind the conclusions are some of the best information available to dispell basic knowledge and assumptions about nutrition. We have a serious nutrition and food supply issue in the US and this book explains the link between this problem and our high rates of disease and cancer. The better results in foreign countries are compelling. This book was recommended to me by an MD cancer survivor who manages cancer clinical trials. I hope this book is the beginning of fundamental re-thinking of nutrition in the US, it should be!! Most important book ever written. This should be rquired reading for anyone interested in good health and nutrition. This should be used in all the schools to teach young people the importance of eating a healthy diet. Excellent!!! You will NOT be disappointed with this book. It WILL open your eyes for sure. If you read it and choose not to follow what it says, at least read it for the knowledge, and be aware of what foods from animal flesh & liquid meat (AKA cows milk) are doing to our bodies. Reading about Campbell's study is fantastic, and simply rings true! So glad I purchased this book! Thanks so much for making it available! This book will change your life and the way you think about food, diet, nutrition and how the government markets all of it to us. Highly recommend! This is a very powerful book supported by solid scientific evidence, that states high protein diets may be detrimental to your health. Dr. Campbell's recommendation is that the reader should become vegan. I am not disputing the fact that there are numerous reasons to not eat meat; Hoof and mouth, mad cow, trichnosis, animal rights and welfare, it just doesn't taste good, etc. I just question whether veganism is really neededThe issues I have with his conculsions are as follows;1) Dr. Campbell suggests through out the book that the problem with western diets is that there's too much protein without enough fruits, vegetables, and complex carbs. So, why wouldn't I just increase my servings of fruits, veggies, complex carbs, and cut down on the meat, why do I have to cut it out altogether?2) The healthiest populations in the world still include animal products but in very small amounts i.e. the Okinawans (Largest centegenarian population), the Andorrans (The longest estimated life span in the world), and the Mediterranean populations in general.3) The general information coming from the study has been the exact same information coming from the health experts for decades: increase the fruits, vegetables, and Complex carbs, cut down on the animal products and refined sugar.4)Now this has nothing to do with Campbell's scientific findings, but the last part of the book degenerates into a \"me versus Big Medicine\" and \"Big Medicine\" has been trying to shut me up for decades. He sounds a little like Kevin Trudeau.All in all, this book provides the everyday person hard scientific proof that we need to radically change our diets for our own sakes. If people walked away from this book with any information, it would be that our health is in our own hands. That we can do more to protect ourselves by watching what we eat, then by going to the doctor. But we also don't have to take 30 nutritional supplements a day to do it. A good, balanced diet is the true miracle pill. I have grown up in the age of technology, where information is too easy to obtain and too difficult to verify. This book has shed the veil on the huge media hoaxes played on us daily related to diet and nutrition. While reading this book I grew very skeptical of the author's claims. Having access to a University's library records I researched his heretic claims and found that he is correct. His book is the most credible of any I have read and has completely changed the way I think of diet.An absolute must-read for the health conscious, or for anyone who's family has a history of serious illnesses (heart disease, cancer, and a plethora of others). easy to read - i recommend this book to everyone! and be sure to pass it on when you finish. Don't miss this book. There is not another book outside of the Bible more important right here and right now. Finally one of the \"establishment\" hollering from the \"ivory towers\" built by taxpayers. Listen to the voice. Even if you don't have time for the whole book..read the first few chapters. After that, skip around if you have to, but keep it handy for quick pick up.If you have never read a book of this type..well good..start here. If you've read John Robbins, Dr. John Mcdougall, Neal Barnard, Dr. Joel Fuhrman...you will still learn lots here! I have been a vegetarian for about 20 years, but have never known that there is more in it than just morals. It is amazing that animal protein can be this dangerous while it is still claimed it is our the best nutrition. I almost returned back to some meat, but now I feel no need and I am happy about my choice. I wish this information could be spread without any prejudices as much as possible. World diserves to know the truth and many people owe it a profound rehabilitation. Bought this book after it was reviewed quite well and recommended. However, I am disappointed that the actual data of the China Study directly contradict the books message. It was actually not animal protein that was statistically significant, but WHEAT! Recommending \"whole-grain wheat\" is scientifically against what the statistics showed, gluten has shown to have very inflammatory properties in double blind studies.I recommend \"ultrametabolism\" or \"protein power\" instead Most of the people reviewing this book give it stars based on whether or not they agree with what the book says or not. I have to say that my review has little to do with my agreeing or not agreeing with the content.I am giving it only three stars because it is called the China Study, so I expected the book to be primarily about just that, the China Study. However, not even 1/4 of the book was about the China Study. It doesn't go very in depth about the study. If you've seen Forks Over Knives, then you know about 90% of the content of the China Study portion of the book. It's very deceiving to name the book after a study and then not actually have the book go that in depth into the study. So whether you agree with the book or not, don't expect to learn extensively about the China Study. This book has the detailed research and other professionals including reputable Doctors to back up the truth that the meat industry has paid off Govt and the health care system to hurt the American people through what we eat . awesome book ! this is a fascinating book that if it is true, I'm going to eat a lot more vegetables and fruit...book claims that it can 'cure' some diseases by a plant based diet as opposed to a meat based diet...the whole thing makes sense... Six years ago I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease). I've always been a healthy eater and believe in natural healing whenever possible, especially through diet and (sigh!) stress reduction. After my diagnosis, I cut out all sugar, wheat and ate even more vegetables and grains. Although I hadn't consumed red meat in 20 years, I did still consume other animal protein. While I was able to successfully control my crohn's disease this way, it was not until reading The China Study that I completely eliminated chicken, turkey, eggs, and cow's dairy. I still eat a small amount of goat yogurt and goat cheese and some fish, and I've never felt better!It was not The China Study alone that influenced my decision to drastically reduce my animal protein consumption. While Dr. Campbell's results are compelling, worrying about contracting some disease in the future is not always enough to persuade most of us to stop eating hamburgers, chicken, eggs or ice cream. The American diet revolves around these foods and it takes a concerted effort to find satisfying alternatives.What cinched my decision to further reduce my animal protein consumption was the information I read in other books about the effect of factory farming on our health, environment, and our collective sense of humanity.Together with The China Study, these books make for impressive reading:* Animal Liberation by Peter Singer* The Food Revolution: How Your Diet Can Help Save Your Life and the World by John Robbins* Plant Roots: Reasons Why the Human Diet is Rooted Exclusively in Plants by Rex BowlbyWhen you consider that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef vs. approximately 24 gallons to produce one pound of wheat, something's wrong. In addition, my consciousness was raised when I realized how animals in factory farms (where most animals we eat are raised) are treated and killed. I was beyond horrified. All I know is that once my awareness was raised there was no going back.Whether you choose to cut out animal protein completely or simply be more conscious in your decisions about what and when you eat it, The China Study along with these other books all give you food for thought. I can't encourage people enough to read them and come to your own conclusions. I am an RN and my husband was a life-long vegetarian when we got married. I was interested in nutrition but still a meat eater. The research in this book is so convincing that we decided for health reasons to become whole food Vegans. Without trying-after 3 months of this I lost aprox 12pds and felt a whole lot better. Had a very healthy baby on this diet 2 years later and still feeling good.If you want to loose weight and reduce risks for CANCER, HEART DISEASE, Type 2 DIABETES etc... READ THIS BOOK! It may save your life. Campbell gives us his conclusions after doing 35 years of laboratory research and 20 years of looking at human populations, their diets, and their health outcomes. He presents compelling evidence from both the lab and real life to support his view that animal protein should be kept to a minimum in our diets for optimal health. Having always been a \"meat and potatoes\" man, this work has convinced me to change my eating plan. One of the best books about diet and health ever written. Everyone should be aware of the link between animal protein and cancer, so that they can protect themselves and their families. The author also appears in the documentary Forks over Knives, a good film about fighting disease with diet instead of drugs. This book is absolutely fascinating! It is written by a brilliant author, very informative and well-researched. The bottom line: eat a plant-based diet! You will be healthy and live longer (and happier)! This is a great book. A very well written, fast and easy read, it exposes facts about the traditional American diet which will forever change the way you eat and feed your children. Dr. Campbell is a brilliant Professor at Cornell University with five decades of experince in nutrition science. The book reveals the ideal diet - what to eat and what to avoid - and discusses the fallacies in the \"food pyramid\" which we have all assumed to be based on sound science and governmental agency action in the public interest. This is an imprtant book which should be part of the standard curriculum in every High School. I buy several copies at a time and give it as a gift to family, friends, my doctors and others I care about. Buy this book. The book arrived promply and in perfect condition. It was a used book but the only detail that makes it look \"not new\" is the fact it's got some writing on the very first page. Nothing to impeed its reading. A very good read. Great book with lots of research but not for the average reader. It's more about the research and doesn't recommend how to change your lifestyle. But he does refer Dr. Esselstyne which you can buy that book to read to help with the change of your lifestyle. What an insightful and informative read. I am a fitness professional, Life Coach and wellness business owner and I think that if someone is in the health, fitness or wellness industry, they really must read this book (I don't often use 'must', but in this case it applies).There are lots of books written by people who have read a lot or research a lot; but not many of them have dedicated 40 years to the physical research & study of protein...which I believe is one of the most confused and confusing macro nutrients for people. The China Study, for its duration and depth, truly is a brilliant case-study, that leaves less to guess or speculation, and a whole lot to specific, measurable and consistent findings.Too often people are focused on external looks, rather than true 'health'. Someone may look good (for now) but actually not have good health. This book allows you to understand 'health' at a much deeper level.The book is an easy read too because it is so informative and interesting. Enjoy! I have tried the following diets, all with initial success:The ZoneBody For LifeSouth BeachIn every case I quit because I just plain felt terrible after a while. In December I decided to try vegetarianism for 30 days and never looked back. I've lost 11 pounds eating AS MUCH AS I WANT and never felt better. My blood pressure dropped from 140/124 to 117/75 in 2 weeks. Why didn't my doctors reccomend this for me? They recommended Beta Blockers and Statins. For a 29 year old! No way. I want to live, not become a 40 year annuity for some pharmaceutical company.Before I read this book, I thought my experience was unique. I was both excited and angry to find out that the scientific data overwhemingly would have predicted my experience. Plant based diets heal diseases of affluence (heart disease, diabetes, cancer)in humans. Its that simple.I have read other books on vegetarianism (Food Revolution, Harvest For Hope, Animal Liberation) and they always seemed a bit partisan to me. I'm all for compassion, but health is my primary concern. Cambell is so thorough in his exposition of the data, from his own studies and many others, that it is difficult to see food through the same lens ever again. Cambell is not a tree hugging activist, or a vitamin salesman. He is not a political partisan. He is Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University.So why doesn't every doctor and health organization get behind Cambell's recommendations? Simple. Some want your money. And some don't believe you can do it. If you read Cambpell's book, it may just give you the motivation to give it a try. At least for 30 days. Excellent and visionary book. Very well written, easy to read, compellng, and dramatic. Couldn't put it down.Must read for anyone who cares at all about what we eat and how we live. I was your average American, believing everything I had heard about eating and nutrition and following along, blindly, without ever questioning the facts behind the information. I thought heart disease and diabetes would be inevetible because I saw it all around me. I had never looked into my eating habits. I didn't realize I was living in a country with the highest rates of PREVENTABLE diseases!This book changed my perspetive about eating, health and nutrition. I became a vegetarian, started eating, and feeding my family, healthier and even went back to college to get a degree in nutrition because I was so fascinated and astonished with the knowledge this book shares! My husband and I are middle-aged but no longer have high cholesterol or blood sugar issues on a plant-based diet and neither of our teenage children are overweight or have any health problems. This book moved me to change careers and my life. This book has information that can help change your health and your life in positive ways! A sobering read that provides much to think about. A Google search for critics, found very few. Anyone searching for a plan, that will aid in future wellness, will find this to be a most informative book. The best solutions in life are the simplest. If your Physician hasn't read this book or agree with the underlying premise then you need a new doctor. This book will only be appreciated by people that make decisions on data and good science. This book improved my health and quality of life. Great book if you are thinking about making a change in your eating habits. Very compelling. This is an important study for anyone interested in their personal health or the health of our society. It provides the science, validating the groundbreaking work of John McDougall and Dean Ornish. This is the kind of information the American public has needed for a long, long time. This is the most comprehensive book on the relationship between nutrition and health I have ever read. I intend to provide my family members with a copy, especially my son in law who is a doctor. I just hope and pray that people will read this excellant work and follow the recommendations it provides. Americans do not have to die from heart disease and cancer and diabetes. Americans do not have to be obese and unfit. This book tells us what the problem is, and what we can do about it if we have the courage and good sense to change. And maybe the best part is that it is simple and inexpensive to do with no risks involved. I am grateful to all those who have had a part in making this available to the American public. Ok, I admit it. I have Attention Deficit Disorder and this book was entirely to much for me to get through. All I need is someone to say &#34;If your problem is *this* then you should be cutting *this* out of your diet and adding *this* to it, and this is why.&#34; I realize that most people want to research the heck out of everything they are doing or what they are going to do but I'm not one of them. If you are like me and just want to be given the basics then avoid this book at all costs. If you are the type of person that needs to know every little detail of the science behind all of the foods you are recommended to eat, this is the book for you. I read this book after reading Dr. Esselstyn's book, and I am convinced now that this research will probably lengthen my life considerably. Although I can see that there is a highly vocal group that seems to take personal affront that someone would dare suggest that our typical American diet is not healthy, I knew after reading these books that I had to try a new way of eating. Almost five months ago now, I was having all of the problems that seem to plague so many Americans in middle age. I am a 47 year old male, and I was eating the typical American diet for the most part. I had tried the zone, tried minimizing calories at various times, and nothing really worked. I'd yo-yo back and forth, and in the meantime I developed high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and rising cholesterol. I was on medicine for blood pressure, low hdl, and reflux, costing me over $100 a month even on excellent insurance. I was pushing 225lbs, suffered from worsening back problems, and was generally fearful that I'd probably follow my father's fate of an early fatal MI. Life insurance cost me 4 times what it cost my wife. The actuaries didn't seem to have much faith in me sticking around. That was 5 months ago.After reading Esselstyn's book, and getting over the initial frustration as to why my Doctor hadn't told me any of this, I decided to give it a try. I cut out all animal products, dairy, refined products, and all added oils. I went with Esselstyn's recommendations 100% from day one. After reading the China Study, I was even more motivated to stick with it.For me, the proof is right there in front of me, or rather where my gut used to be. I have lost almost 30 pounds, I am off my blood pressure, cholesterol, and reflux meds, and even my back feels better. I've done this without any increase in exercise, and I eat constantly, and as much as I want, as long as it's not animal based or with added oils of any kind.To me, the argument is over, and I'm never going back. Yes, I take vitamins to avoid B12 deficiency, and yes, it's a pain sometimes when going to restaurants, but with a young daughter, I have all the motivation I need to stick with this for life. If my doctor had a pill that could have done all these things for me, I'm sure it would be the drug of all time. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait for that pipedream, and I thank Dr's Campbell and Esselstyn every day now for what they've done for me. A very useful companion to the movie \"Forks over Knives\", and in itself a very useful guide to nutritionally guiding your health I would unabashedly recommend this book to everyone! I have researched and read about nutrition my whole life but never found any REAL answers or explanations as to how to eat well for good health as well as sustain our earth. This book removes the haze of confusion of conflicting recommendations by our government and the status quo. I was blown away by the extensive research and their findings and so ANGRY that this information is being hidden or denied for public consumption. I am just beginning my journey to vegetarianism and feel so hopeful that this is the best present I could give myself, my family and the world. This is truly a gift that will keep on giving. Go Paleo. Veganism will kill you early. Steve Jobs dead body will back me up on that.A high carbo and low fat diet is the cause of many diseases. It raises insulin levels in the blood. Insulin is a hormone. You have too much of any hormone and problems arise, such as obesity, diabetes, skin ailments, lung problems, cancer, mental disease, etc. Get off the plants. Your not a herbivore. Your a hunter/gatherer. A caveman. Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. I felt like I was in a college course and learning so much. I have been a vegetarian for over twenty years but this book kicked it up a notch higher. I kept reading parts of it to my husband who became interested in it and also read it. He has been a real meat eater all of our 43 years of marriage and immediately after reading the book he turned vegan as did I. We go forward with good health and he has lost seven pounds in a little over two weeks. We eat wonderful vegan meals that I prepare at home and enjoy doing so. We have since given this book to many of our family and friends. I wish it had been published thirty years ago when I was raising our family. Thank you Colin Campbell for all your research and this amazing book! This is one of the most impactful books I've ever read, and I'm grateful it was written. This book will leave the information clear for you to make your own *informed* decisions. Without the solid science documented here, relying just on the food industry run USDA, understanding what it takes to be healthy is like finding your way out of a maze of mirrors. Get ready to dive deep into the science of health and disease.Not only is nutrition and disease discussed, but also why we knew what we thought we knew beforehand. Secrets of the food industry manipulation of the USDA are discussed with first hand experience. One should be able to expect their government to inform them of the healthiest way to eat, instead of folding to the corruptive tactics and money of agribusiness. You must know for yourself how to stay healthy. The US government is not your ally in this quest. I was scheduled for weight loss surgery when I was turned on to this book THE CHINA STUDY. As I read it I realized that I could do this after the surgery. Surgery was scheduled for Monday morning early and Friday evening I made a phone call to my nephew and after 1 hour on the phone I realized I didn't need to go through with the surgery. I walked out of the bedroom and my wife made me call and cancel the surgery. I did and it was the best thing for me. I didn't need the surgery because with this book and this knowledge I could do it without the surgery. I never felt comfortable about the surgery but I wanted to get my life back and get off of my diabetic meds so bad that I was willing to do it. I had jumped through all the hoops and had lost 20 lbs. qualifing for the surgery and continued loosing weight without starving to death and one month later the doctor took me off one of my diabetic meds. I was thrilled. I continue to loose weight, feel better and better and I am glad that I still had some of my old cloths that I had grown out of. The weight loss surgery people tell you this is your last chance and the only way to lose weight permenantly. You don't know how many people I know that have gained it back. There must be some discipline somewhere. Read this book and change your life style, improve the quality of your life and rid yourselves of diease. This book should be the Standard Works or the Bible for those that want to be healthy. For years I've heard that people can change and heal themselves through changing their diets. Will here it is in black and white, the answers, the HOW TO to take control of your life and health. This book will open up a whole new world to you. I have many personel experiances of loved ones who have reversed their health issues. Don't be afraid to contact me. I am an old fat man who is crippled and I am still loosing weight and getting healthier. Dr. Campbell lays out his life's study of nutrition and how it interacts with disease. This book is not about fad diets or trendy nutrient supplements, but rather, it is a well reasoned treatise regarding eating habits and disease. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in their health. Everyone should read this book - it provides true unvarnished and easy to understand dietary advice that isn't watered down. Yet another book suggested by my husband's doctor. It's very detailed with charts and figures. It will take him sometime to read it from front to back but he's working on it. This was a life changing book for me. I was already a vegetarian but am now committed to being vegan for life. This is a convincing book on the topic of how animal based products can compromise your health. However, to implement it I strongly suggest Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman. That book will tell you how to eat a healthy plant based diet and avoid the health problems that both books describe in detail. The information in this book was ,it seems, the foundation for much of the work done by dr fuhrman,and dr Esselstyn and Dr Cornish. Dr Esselstyn has done astounding work at the Cleveland clinic showing incredible results working with very diseased individuals. His major finding has been that a plant based diet can reverse the health of very diseased individuals provided they restrict their diets to plant based foods. Everyone of his patients had a total reversal of their health provided they stayed on a plant based diet. Those that went off the diet had serious health complications soon after their decisions not to continue with theirPlant based diets. Dr Furhman has a web cite that testifies very similar findings as does Dr Esselstyn and dr Cornish! Dr Fuhrman has a much larger client than any of the other Doctors. He sees about 5000 patients per year and the results are quiteAstounding ! Check them out Drfuhrman.com.How can anyone refute the vast number of individuals who all attest to incredible changes to their health?I do not know one person who has gone onto this diet and has not lost considerable weight, felt a lot more energetic,And have seen their cholesterol,blood pressure and blood sugat make significant progress !MY wife and I have been on this diet for 3 months and have found our health and energy levels to be significantly better.All my family and friends that I have given the program to have likewise found very similar results !Dr fuhrman contends alon with Dr Cambell and Dr Esselton that Heart DISEASE,Diabetes,,Stokes and Cancer can be cured byGoing to a Plant based diet! The only way to refute this statement is for some individual to show someone who has followed this diet for over a year and after that period of time come down with one of these major diseases ! So far I have not seen anyone making that claim ! By the way Dr Fuhrman. Contends it is diet and exercise. Eating is just not enough ! Diet with exercise will give incredible results ! Not sure why the title \"China Study\" was used as there is not a great deal written about the study itself. I'd really expected to read about the variety of foods in various regions of China and their impact on health, weight, and fitness. I don't argue with the authors' promotion of a 'whole food, plant based' diet. A more accurate title would include that phrase - it was repeated enough in the book. Eighteen months ago I started on a 'food combining' diet to help with some really nasty digestive issues I had going on. I immediately improved and that kept me on the diet...I love to feel good! Now I have read and re-read \"The China Study\". I have marked all over the text and in the margins. I realize that the reason I feel so good is because the food combining emphasizes fruits, veggies, grains, and seeds and minimizes meat and dairy. Of course, the boxed stuff (in the center of the store) is out, but I never could see why you would eat that. So now I am going vegan. It will be gradual but I know it will be tasty and I am going to feel even better. I mean, my posture has improved, my stamina is greater, my outlook is better, my weight is normal, my BMI is normal, my blood cholesterol is great, my blood pressure has gone down to normal. I really feel sorry for people who are still eating hashed browns covered in a pool of melted cheese. What are they thinking?!?!? They say, \"Oh, but it's soooo good.\" Of course it is...what's not to like? But is it worth it? I just bought 10 copies of this book. I am going to give one to our library. It is my Christmas gift this year. I am sending one to everyone I can think of. I wouldn't be surprised if I buy a hundred or more before it is over. And I am reading all the related material too. Thanks Dr. Campbell! You have answered my prayers! Now how do we get the word out to the rest of the country...the world? We don't need health CARE reform, we need health INFORMATION reform. The American people are smart. If they have the info they need, they can make good choices and they can kiss those meds and procedures good-bye. this book is not about going vegan or vegetarian, it's about providing facts, and that scares a lot of people.the fact that what you eat and how that food got to your plate greatly impacts you is very important.Just on the news this week they were talking about how 50% of the US population will be obese or overweight soon and how obesity overtaking smoking as the number 1 killer in America.you don't need to stop eating meat to benefit from this book, but greatly cutting down on the amount and being very careful of where it comes from will be very beneficial.what's great about this book is that it provides scientific data from decades of research and the study is still ongoing.I'd also highly recommend the movie Food Inc which Martha Stewart just showcased on her show this week. I am 42 and have read dozens of diet books over the years and tried them all. I've been feeling pretty ill the last year and had gotten up to 265 lbs.I read this book and couldn't put it down. I started eating whole plant foods exclusively last Christmas and now 2 months later I'm down 30 lbs. and doing two gym classes a day at least 3 times a week and feel great.Besides losing weight and getting a ton of energy another thing that happened is my breath actually smells good now instead of like something died in me.I'd never have thunk it but I think now that humans are built to eat plants.Once nice thing about the book is that it uses wide reaching statistics and numbers instead of anecdotal theories and opinions that so many diet books use.There's real healing in this book.Read it and live. Very comprehensive study showing the dileterious effects of animal protien on human health. A bit redundant, but well worth the read. Its probably at the root of why so many people have choosen to become vegetarian I'm 2/3 through a book called \"The China Study\" by T Colin Campbell, Ph.D., an icon in the field of micro-biology and nutritional medicine. The book reflects the culmination of 27 years of analytic research, all peer reviewed and published in all the right journals of medicine, into the associations of diet and Western Diseases - including all the cancers, heart disease, diabetes (1 and 2), and obesity. His research was triangular: Molecular laboratory studies, laboratory studies with rats and mice, and the most comprehensive epidemiological study on nutrition and disease ever conducted - which is the title of the book - the China Study.I'll touch on the lab study with rats and mice, whose findings were confirmed by the other two types of studies. The livers of thousands of rats were injected with Aflatoxin, a highly toxic carcinogen. Then they were separated into two groups - one group was fed a diet of which 5% of calorie intake was animal protein (casein). The diet of the second group consisted of 20% animal protein. The normal life span of the rats is 2 years. Within 18 months, 100% of the rats fed the second diet were dead or dying of cancer of the liver, while 0% of the first group died of this disease. Dr Campbell's group was astonished, as a 0 to 100% result almost never happens, so they did the study again, and again, and again, scores of times. They then decided to use a different specie, using mice instead, and got the exact same results.In the China Study, the epidemiological study that extended not only to China but to the Phillipines, Indonesia, and other Asian countries, the research group learned that there appears to be a one-to-one correlation between eating a Western diet (meats, dairy, eggs) and the incidence of cancers, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Again, in regions where greater amounts of animal protein are part of the diet, they found greater incidence of Western Disease. And the more animal protein people ate, the more the incidence of these diseases, the less animal protein they ate, the less incidence of such diseases.I believe that if you read just the first 69 pages, the first 3 chapters, you won't be able to put the book down. It's one of those life changing books. One of my favorite books of all time! If you care at all about your health and preventing diseases like cancer, heart disease auto immune diseases, etc. then READ it! Here: Rawfoodsos dot com.The one of the best critiques of this book out there. Everyone, defenders and otherwise, should read the above post. Very interesting points, and it makes me wonder if agenda came before science and logic in this book. Props to Free The Animal. I would consider this book required reading for every single person.Whether the information within led to any changes in dietary choices or not, it is only with access to the massive array of research data covered that any decision could truly be called well informed.It is criminal that the information covered is not already common knowledge.For me, the impact of this book has been a firm commitment to a permanent happy & healthy life supporting diet.I recommend this book to each and every human that eats food, so that of course means everyone! Finally, an author who makes sense of all the conflicting recommendations out there, concerning the effects of diet on our health. He demonstrates clearly how thousands of scientific studies of different kinds (longitudinal, cross-cultural, laboratory) converge repeatedly on the same sensible message, \"You are what you eat.\" He waits until the end of the book to explain the big question: Why have we been misinformed for so long, by so many stellar, reputable sources? This book is a must read for EVERYONE. It is also interesting and fascinating, full of human stories as well as understandable and irrefutable statistics that drive home the points: Eating meat and dairy products is a bad habit of western, affluent societies that causes most of the diseases that cost lives, happiness, and that drain our wealth. Although a vegetarian since 1971, refusing to eat anything with eyes out of compassion for other species' equal right to live, I'd sporadically kept eating dairy and egg products, dully telling myself it was okay, they're being exploited, sure, but not killed - until reading Dr. Campbell's landmark work.Discovering the cruel, commodified treatment of layer chickens and dairy cows and how they, too, have a date with the executioner once their \"useful product life\" expires, that tipped me to going vegan at long last. Also, his rigorous objectivity and thoroughness in establishing irrefutable links between animal-based diet and the onset of almost every degenerative disease under the sun floored me.Along with John Robbins's landmark works, the book reawakened a keen awareness of the sensibilities, intelligence, and feelings of the animal kingdom. It brought home how weird it is, really, to exploit our fellow species for food sources, methodically robbing mothers of nursing fluids and embryos, let alone slaying them, for food sources when nature's bounty provides everything we need for nutritious, varied and delicious eating. It brought home how all manner of life-shortening disease is the inevitable result when we stray from whole food, plant-based diets humans are designed to eat and how greedy meat and dairy companies have systematically brainwashed people into accepting violence-born food as normal and necessary for health when it's just the opposite.I admit I had to work to get past his sometimes dry scientific approach to the subject to sustain my interest, but once I did I learned to marvel at his disciplined approach -- and his spine for standing up to his bought-off colleagues and other nutritional specialist shills with their distorted studies and outright lies adversely affecting the lives of millions in the name of mammon.Even if one doesn't feel compassion for other being's right to live, if you at all question the wisdom of accepted animal-based diet and its possible health consequences, this book could well save your life. Many claims made in this book are in defiance of medical history and common sense.Degenerative diseases emerged explosively in the 20th century (following the invention of the high speed steel roller mill, which made white flour and white sugar very cheap). Yet people have been consuming animal products since long before the 20th century. The explosive growth of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease does not correspond to an explosion in the consumption of animal foods.The book doesn't mention America's premiere thinker on nutrition and health, Weston Price. It doesn't explain why the French, Swiss, and Eskimos are healthier than Americans, despite their diets rich in saturated animal fats.This book was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone. As an ex dairy farmer it is disappointing to think you spent most of your life poisoning people.A real revolutionary book which every one should read.An eye opener. BooK: is in excellent condition. I have not gotten around to reading it yet but it looks great. Thank you. This book focus largely on heart diseases, osteoporosis, breast and prostate cancer. It devotes extensive charts and graphs linking between high animal products consumption and high risks of developing such diseases and high fruits and vegetable consumption and low risks of developing such diseases.This is the point to refer your friends if they do not believe in reducing their animal products consumptions.However, The coverage of liver cancer, one of my particular interest and top cancer killer in Asia, is brief compared to the other diseases in this book.Since I do not eat enough raw green vegetables from my meal, I drink them. Check out the delicious green juices from Jennifer Cornbleet's Raw Food Made Easy recipe book, another well-received book on Amazon that I highly recommend.I suffer less from chronic sinusitis and my skin allergies have cleared up during these times and before that, I thought I had been a healthy eater. The information isn't really new. But the fact that it is backed up by mountains of research, and yet is being actively repressed by the powers it threatens makes it all the more powerful. Basically it says follow the same eating habits the hippies have been promoting for the last thirty years, and you can't get heart disease, cancer or auto-immune diseases. Can't get them. They can't prosper without animal protein. So keep the animal protein (particularly dairy) to a minimum, and eat only whole plant foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts...). For the past five weeks I have been doing the best(but not religiously) to follow the findings of the studies, without any expectations. The results have been nothing short of remarkable. I used to have the hardest time getting out of bed. When I exercised or walked, it felt like I was carrying my body around. Now I am hyper. I jump out of bed in the morning, I work out. I go on long hikes... daily. It is almost too much. My persona was built around being mellow. Being in love with being in bed. Being calm and consistent. It really has been a bit tough, on me and my friends (who IS this guy, and what happened to el Deano?). Highly recommended.For the complete review see greenagogo.com In the beginning of the book it appears that Campbell is going to give specific scientific findings of a study done in China that would confirm the connection of animal protein diet with cancer. He starts with studies of rodents that showed 100% statistical connection. It was expected that the same type of information would ensue, but it didn't.As the above review by Joseph DeMarinis \"Truth in science\" so decidedly outlines, Campbell goes mostly into broad statements taken from the dogma of vegetarianism.I got this book after taking the caregivers course at the Gerson Institute in San Diego where Dr. Max Gerson proved that a 100% vegetarian diet with juicing and techniques to pull out toxins cures cancer-- even advanced cancer after conventional medical techniques have failed. The Gerson diet stops tumor growth and completely invigorates the immune system to curing many other twentieth century diseases. It follows that a diet mostly of vegetables and fruits would be beneficial for preventing disease.This book did not come close to my expectations and is not recommended.One final point for the readers of this concerns the insistance that a 100% vegan diet cures heart disease. In the book by Internationally acclaimed Cardiologist, Dr. Sodi Pallares, \"My Hearts Health\", Dr. Pallares states that after he observed thousands of patients on his vegetable and fruit diet that he found they did better with some good fats (2 tbls per day) and some protein. He lived to age 90 on that diet. This book changed my life! Bought it along with the book 'Forks Over Knives'. I did a total change of my diet based on the information contained in 'The China Study'. At the start of the book there's talk about an experiment with \"protein\" and mice. And Campbell gives a superficially persuasive account of how this \"protein\" was profoundly to blame for switching cancer on and off in the experiments.He seemed to be explaining things in a straight-forward and honest way. Leaving nothing out, careful to reference to his own precision and objectivity as a scientist not to get carried away by the findings. I was blown away by the implications and suggestions of these things he was describing. Little did I realize until later that this was all a pack of lies.I also thought that this was a perfect \"test\" to see whether he was credible, whether he was reliable or not, by looking up the internet later. He didn't mention animal protein at this time. In fact I was really upset and desperately searched the index to see if my beloved fish and peanuts were okay in this. I thought that if this food-terrorism could be substantiated then I would be fully on board. If however he was merely a charlatan then he would be leaving out things in this study.Turns out I didn't even have to wait to get on the internet to see if he was full of it or not. A couple of pages later and he casually mentions that all of these experiments were done using CASEIN. Not JUST ANY PROTEIN. Not CONTROLLING for different times of protein. Not whey protein here, casein there, plant protein over there. It's ridiculous. I never drink cow's milk and very, very rarely get casein. It's his inability to tell an important point from a totally unimportant one that got me most of all there. I was well aware that casein was a bad protein to be avoided, though perhaps not with the cancer shock that he's trying to induce considering that people who drink milk have in some studies a LOWER rate of cancer. And this was only after dosage with large amounts of aflatoxin.I later found out that even the casein helped protect against the aflatoxin. But Campbell hid that. And you have to ask WHY. I agree with a lot of what Campbell stands for in diet, but why does he feel such a need to hide and distort things?There is a blog which completely dissects the data of the China Study here: [...]I have read Campbell's responses to these and other commentaries and they basically amount to: 1) You don't understand statistics. 2) This was just my \"story\" of things that seemed to come together for me personally.The first one is ad hominem, and then second basically admits that this whole thing is just a fictional or anecdotal account of things, his informal \"story\" of how things were. But I still don't understand how this allows him to ignore data that doesn't fit with his theory, to just leave them out of the book altogether.He says that he considered his options when writing it: 1) To give a one-sided view of the data 2) To give an all-sides account without bias 3) To give his \"personal story\" of how it came about that he would come to believe in this idea and this diet.In MY opinion, either of the first two would be good. I certainly don't mind someone advocating a particular diet SO LONG AS THEY ALSO GIVE THE ARGUMENTS THAT GO AGAINST THEM!!!!! Not try and hide them.But he said that he would take the third option, and that when the data didn't fit properly... he would just put it down to experimental error because he knew the way the general numbers were going anyway, and he wouldn't mention it.I wonder if it could rather be that Campbell's study was a failure and he just couldn't accept that. This could have been a great book for bringing diet into the 21st century... it could show how unreliable cross-studies of populations are. But instead Campbell chose to try to exhert his own opinions on things.My own diet is very high on fruit/vegetables and low on animal protein, so I'm not one of those staunch advocates of very high animal protein. I read it. I thought about what I had read, and decided to reread it to make sure I remembered it correctly. I bought the logic of the book all the way. I have changed the way I eat. Now I feel better. I lost weight. I even began a regular exercise program. I purchased 5 more of the books and gave them to everyone I care about. They have changed the way they eat. Reciently my wife even gave one to our Doctor.The book is easy reading and I recomend it to anyone who cares about their health enough to seriously try to improve it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I recommend this book highly. I've tried every diet known to man and like this life style the best. I found the book to be quite enlightening. I appreciated the scientific approach to studying the effects of our diet on our health. I feel that I was given the knowledge to better assess my diet. I didn't read all the discussions, but the ones I did read were so far from credible intellectual discourse, I wouldn't consider any of them helpful. It was more like a political debate, and trying to segregate the \"facts\" from the \"fracts\" was so tiring I gave up in disgust.I'll stick to the Reviews in the future! The information in this book is too important for us to remain silent. All around us are people suffering from disease and misinformation. Perhaps eating vegan will not solve all our problems but if it saves one person we love from a devastating illness, will it not have been worth it? The China Study paired with the movie \"Forks over Knives\" was instrumental in me becoming vegan. Filled with powerful information that every person on earth should know. It is my wish that everyone read this book and understand how blind we have allowed ourselves to become! The China Study is a book everyone in the United States needs to read. Your life may depend on it.It's mind boggling that this information has been deliberately withheld from us when our very lives were at risk. The information in this book would have saved the life of my father and best friend had it been made available to them prior to their deaths.Anger at big business and our government doesn't cover the emotions everyone feels after reading this book.The China Study has dramatically altered my life, my wife's life, and everyone we've shared it with.Don't just read it! Buy an extra copy for a friend!Steve & Joyce Vaughn, living a longer, healthier life thanks to The China Study! This is THE book that put me on the path of being a vegetarian. Highly recommended. I bought couple of more copies, and gave to my friends as holiday gifts. This is the best nutrition book I have ever read, and I have read many. I read this book, in large part, based on the reviews of other people. I'm so grateful to all of you who wrote before me and so thankful I bought this book and read it. It is truly a message that must be heard by every American. Don't be scared of the title \"The China Study.\" It is informative but not the least bit dry or difficult to read. I found it fascinating, so much so that I read it like a textbook so that I would retain more on my first reading. You can be sure, I'll read it again.Why do we not hear about the value of eating a plant-based diet from our physicians? Because they don't believe it? Because they, themselves, are uninformed? Because they, like we, believe the marketing and \"research\" supporting the status quo? Because they don't believe that, even if we knew, we'd do anything different? Yes, to all of these. The shame is that thousands die every week from diseases that could be prevented or even reversed.For all our technology and for all we spend on health care, we, as Americans, have terrible health. What if we all ate a plant-based diet? Can you imagine what we'd save in health care dollars, to say nothing of the suffering we needlessly put ourselves through? It does require change which is always difficult at first, but Colin and Thomas Campbell provide such a convincing argument for making this necessary change.The word must get out. If you have cancer, diabetes, heart disease, weight problems, immunity problems (and the list goes on), don't pop a pill or supplement. Read this. If you want to avoid health problems in the future, read this. If you want to reverse your disease or improve your health, read this. This should be required reading of every high school student in the country. Science teachers, are you listening? This book is a real eye opener. The facts are there. If Americans don't change their diet, they're going to die. Just take a look around. Do you see overweight Asians? If you say YES, its because they have adopted an American diet. Older Asians are slim because they eat a plant based diet. This book opened my eyes. And I started eating differently and within a short period of time, I saw differences. This book is full of facts, just the facts. The conclusions are yours to make. As a nutritional hobbyist, I thought I was up on all the latest valid scientific research regarding antioxidants, flavanols etc. After reading Dr. Campbell's book, I realized how clueless I was and how simple the answer was -- eating a well-rounded plant based diet which naturally contained the antioxidants and flavanols all in a synergistic relationship as nature intended. The negative research about the effect of animal protein and fat came as no surprise. I've changed my diet in accordance with THE CHINA STUDY and within a month my lifelong respiratory allergies were gone. The part that incites anger is the stronghold the food and drug lobbies have on what's most recommended, even for school lunches. I congratulate Dr. Campbell for his thorough and objective book and his courage in attacking the sacred cows (no pun intended) of corporate nutritional research and their obviously biased, self-serving recommendations. This is an eye opener and turns nearly all my previously learned facts on nutrition upside down ..... if we deny scientific evidence then we will never learn! I've read this book on my Kindle, highlighted passages and shared the book with family and friends. Buy it. Read it. It will change your life for the better. I was initially swayed by the book, but after two years of being a vegetarian, I didn't lose any weight or feel much better. What Campbell is missing from this vegan diatribe is the fact that grass-fed meat and other healthier (hormone and antibiotic-free, free-range, etc.) animal products are very good for you. In fact, there are quite a few anthropological studies (Inuit Eskimos in Alaska, Masai in Kenya) which support this. To date, I know of no actual studies of indigenous vegan populations. What's also ironic about this book is how little of the China Study itself is mentioned here.Also, Campbell makes a lot of poor judgments on low-carb diets, which are continually bashed by him, Ornish and other supporters of the low-fat vegetarian lifestyle. One very recent study at Stanford confirmed that the Atkins Diet not only resulted in the most weight loss, but also healthy blood lipid profiles as well. [...] We need fats (Trans fats, however, need to be avoided at all costs!), including saturated fat, in our diets for many health reasons, including vitamin absorption. Campbell's low-fat dogma is not only unrealistic, it's unhealthy! Vegan diets, especially those high in soy, are also bound to cause serious vitamin deficiencies in the long-term. I know that's what I experienced.My solution: eat organic foods of all kinds whenever possible; avoid processed foods, refined sugars and carbohydrates, artificial ingredients and trans fats; and base your personal nutrition on facts, not ideology. A must read! The last part on goverment, pharmaceuticals, the meat & dairy corporations and the medical establishment is a real eye opener! Unlike many fad diet books, this book is heavily documented with scientific research to show you the benefits of a \"whole food plant based diet\". It links, in detail, the root causes of our \"modern-day\" diseases to our \"Western\", animal-protein rich diet.And it also goes on to explain why this information is not getting out to the public, how interest groups and even government are involved.A highly recommended read, that if taken seriously (as it should), will change your lifestyle for ever. So many people are confused about diet and health. Many proclaimed diet authors, In an attempt to capture a broader audience, twist what should be a simple message and market their nutritional programs in favour of peoples tastes, preferences and addictions (never underestimate the power of telling people what they want to hear). This has resulted in many people becoming preoccupied by calories alone. However, being thin and being healthy are not the same thing. For those of you who are fed up with the 'quick fix' paradigm and who are seeking authentic nutrition and health longevity, you must read Campbell's China Study (several times!). The results of Campbell's life's work may be hard, for some people, to initially swallow, especially if you follow conventional wisdom and/or if The China Study is your first exposure to nutrition science (not popular diet books).Conducted in some of most pristine environments on earth, before modern farming methods/chemical pollutants and before the introduction of refined flour/sugars, The China Study exposes the causative links between what we eat, our health outcomes, the length and quality of our lives. Dr. Campbell's extensive research shows how certain foods can be as powerful as medicine, while others, as toxic as a drugs. And, by making some simple changes in our food choices, we can not only prevent, stop the progression of, but in most cases reverse some of our most crippling diseases.Remain open, dispute your current thinking and set yourself free from dieting and personal agendas. The China Study will not only lay the foundation for your health, but the sustainability and health of our planet - a win, win. A word of encouragement for those who believe they are addicted to the fatty/sugary Western diet: Your tastes are completely determined by your eating habits and are subject to change at anytime!Stick with the science and the message is crystal clear! Get caught up in personal opinions and preferences and you will surely get confused and fuel the current health model. Enjoy!! WOW !!! My husband went from being a meateater to vegan over night. His chloresterol dropped from 180 to 124. Love the book & we live a vegal lifestyle. After reading The China Study it makes complete sense to adopt a vegan lifestyle. After my own bout with gallstones I began taking a serious look at my eating habits and causes of disease in Western culture. The China Study has reinforced the idea that our health is in our own hands and what we put into our mouth. The relationship between diet and disease is clear, and once you understand that, you will never EAT the same again! Thank you Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Thomas Campbell, II! Este libro cambiar&aacute; tu vida.Es la prueba cient&iacute;fica esperada por esc&eacute;pticos mostrando que fuimos creados para comer una dieta basada en plantas, granos, y frutas.This book will change your life.This book provides that scientific proof that sceptics want, showing that we have been created to eat a plant, fruit and whole grain diet. Just want to note that I took a look through all of the negative reviews here. As a freelance writer myself, I know that there are writing gigs out there that actually hire people to write product reviews, and I also know that there are people who work for companies who post good reviews to promote their products and bad reviews of the competition. That should come as no surprise, unless you're really naive. To see that all of these negative reviews repeat the same points and they are all long-winded and supposedly fact-laden makes me really question if they are legitimately from the common users. All of a sudden all of these people have time to write these long reviews that aren't so typical for most other books here on Amazon, and of course, this is a book promoting a plant-based, cruelty-free lifestyle that, if more people adopted, would harm the ridiculously profitable industries that exploit animals, namely the meat and dairy industries.Read the book and then learn more from other scientific sources, and adopt the vegan lifestyle to see how much your health benefits from it when you do it correctly. This is the most amazing book I have ever read on health and nutrition. I may buy some more copies and share with friends and family. It just needs to be read. It starts a little slow but has amazing conclusions.It has caused me to completely change the way we eat. I believe that anyone interested in true health should read this book. You will never think the same way about diet again. If you follow the principles in this book you should have a much greater quality of life. Very eye-opening! I read this book shortly after it was released and have given a copy to our children and to others whom would benefit. My husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol years ago and then had bypass surgery 11 years ago. My goal is to improve his and my eating habits. The results have been wonderful and our youngest son and his wife have also embraced a mostly plant based diet. My husband is 72 and in excellent health thanks to our diet. Dr. Campbell has written an excellent book that is full of important health research that is easy to comprehend. Here's a pretty good article discussing the book: [...]I've attached the author's summary/conclusion:In summary and conclusion...Apart from his cherry-picked references for other studies (some of which don't back up the claims he cites them for), Campbell's strongest arguments against animal foods hinge heavily on:Associations between cholesterol and disease, andHis discoveries regarding casein and cancer.For #1, it seems Campbell never took the critical step of accounting for other disease-causing variables that tend to cluster with higher-cholesterol counties in the China Study--variables like schistosomiasis infection, industrial work hazards, increased hepatitis B infection, and other non-nutritional factors spurring chronic conditions. Areas with lower cholesterol, by contrast, tended to have fewer non-dietary risk factors, giving them an automatic advantage for preventing most cancers and heart disease. (The health threats in the lower-cholesterol areas were more related to poor living conditions, leading to greater rates of tuberculosis, pneumonia, intestinal obstruction, and so forth.)Even if the correlations with cholesterol did remain after adjusting for these risk factors, it takes a profound leap in logic to link animal products with disease by way of blood cholesterol when the animal products themselves don't correlate with those diseases. If all three of these variables rose in unison, then hypotheses about animal foods raising disease risk via cholesterol could be justified. Yet the China Study data speaks for itself: Animal protein doesn't correspond with more disease, even in the highest animal food-eating counties--such as Tuoli, whose citizens chow down on 134 grams of animal protein per day.Nor is the link between animal food consumption and cholesterol levels always as strong as Campbell implies. For instance, despite eating such massive amounts of animal foods, Tuoli county had the same average cholesterol level as the near-vegan Shanyang county, and a had a slightly lower cholesterol than another near-vegan county called Taixing. (Both Shanyang and Taixing consumed less than 1 gram of animal protein per day, on average.) Clearly, the relationship between animal food consumption and blood cholesterol isn't always linear, and other factors play a role in raising or lowering levels.For #2, Campbell's discoveries with casein and cancer, his work is no doubt revelatory. I give him props for dedicating so much of his life to a field of disease research that wasn't always well-received by the scientific community, and for pursuing so ardently the link between nutrition and health. Unfortunately, Campbell projects the results of his casein-cancer research onto all animal protein--a leap he does not justify with evidence or even sound logic.As ample literature indicates, other forms of animal protein--particularly whey, another component of milk--may have strong anti-cancer properties. Some studies have examined the effect of whey and casein, side-by-side, on tumor growth and cancer, showing in nearly all cases that these two proteins have dramatically different effects on tumorigenesis (with whey being protective). A study Campbell helped conduct with one of his grad students in the 1980s showed that the cancer-promoting abilities of fish protein depended on what type of fat is consumed alongside it. The relationship between animal protein and cancer is obviously complex, situationally dependent, and bound with other substances found in animal foods--making it impossible extrapolate anything universal from a link between isolated casein and cancer.On page 106 of his book, Campbell makes a statement I wholeheartedly agree with:Everything in food works together to create health or disease. The more we think that a single chemical characterizes a whole food, the more we stray into idiocy.It seems ironic that Campbell censures reductionism in nutritional science, yet uses that very reductionism to condemn an entire class of foods (animal products) based on the behavior of one substance in isolation (casein).In sum, \"The China Study\" is a compelling collection of carefully chosen data. Unfortunately for both health seekers and the scientific community, Campbell appears to exclude relevant information when it indicts plant foods as causative of disease, or when it shows potential benefits for animal products. This presents readers with a strongly misleading interpretation of the original China Study data, as well as a slanted perspective of nutritional research from other arenas (including some that Campbell himself conducted).In rebuttals to previous criticism on \"The China Study,\" Campbell seems to use his curriculum vitae as reason his word should be trusted above that of his critics. His education and experience is no doubt impressive, but the \"Trust me, I'm a scientist\" argument is a profoundly weak one. It doesn't require a PhD to be a critical thinker, nor does a laundry list of credentials prevent a person from falling victim to biased thinking. Ultimately, I believe Campbell was influenced by his own expectations about animal protein and disease, leading him to seek out specific correlations in the China Study data (and elsewhere) to confirm his predictions.It's no surprise \"The China Study\" has been so widely embraced within the vegan and vegetarian community: It says point-blank what any vegan wants to hear--that there's scientific rationale for avoiding all animal foods. That even small amounts of animal protein are harmful. That an ethical ideal can be completely wed with health. These are exciting things to hear for anyone trying to justify a plant-only diet, and it's for this reason I believe \"The China Study\" has not received as much critical analysis as it deserves, especially from some of the great thinkers in the vegetarian world. Hopefully this critique has shed some light on the book's problems and will lead others to examine the data for themselves. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in improving overall health and control weight. Wow! A paradigm shift away from mainstream ideas on nutrition. Very threatening to some -- many will not be ready to read this and reject it's premise out of fear. If you read and enjoyed Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma, then you may be ready for this book. This book is a must if you are intrested in taking control of your health in the best way possible -- your diet. I switched to a vegan diet after watching FoK and reading the china study. I feel great and i greatly enjoy the food i eat. Primarily because i live in Thailand which has already a huge amount of delicious and healthy food, and all of these foods can be ordered or cooked in a vegetarian way (which means automatically vegan as we don't use milk here too much anyway). So there is a lot of choice of very yummy food available.Love the food, love the health benefits and don't miss anything at all. Thanks Mr. Campbell! I REALLY didn't want to finish this book. I knew in my heart if I finished the book that I would feel obligated to make a life altering decision. You see, I've known for a long time that the principles discussed in this book were true. I lived on a Chinese diet for 2 years and I know I was healthier while I did it. I've known for a very long time that a diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, and grains, with meat eaten sparingly, was best for me. This book adds the weight of irrefutable scientific study to what I already knew but didn't have the discipline to live.And I really don't trust science very much. Well, actually, I have no problem with the scientific method. I don't trust scientists whose findings support the special interests that fund them. And that covers 99% of the scientific findings that are presented before the general public. The second half of this book is devoted to demonstrating how special interests skew \"science\".I believe Dr. Campbell because he stated what he found even when it was counter to the interests of those who funded him. I have done a cursory scan of the literature available on the Internet for refutations of Dr. Campbell's work and found only posturing, heated rhetoric, name-calling, and references to the kind of studies that are clearly biased in the interests of the funders. In other words, I found only the sort of thing that has destroyed my faith in scientists.Now I'm obligated to make that life altering decision. The difficulty will lie in getting my wife and daughter to support me in that decision. An intense outlook on what we have been putting in our bodies & why we are getting plauged with illnesses. A MUST READ FOR ALL !!!!!!This is not a diet book - but a life style change ! Read it & practice what it says - take your life back. T. Colin Campbell's career-long study of nutrition has produced a simple assertion backed up by empirical evidence: that a diet featuring animal protein and fat is harmful to human health - the best action you can take in order to have long-term health is to eat a plant-based diet. But don't think this statement capture the full import of the book. \"The China Study\" is well worth reading from cover to cover. Along the way, Campbell has many insightful thing to say about human nutrition, the nature of scientific investigation, and the depredations caused by scientific reductionism.Towards the end, he asks the following disturbing questions:\"How did we get to a place where the healers of our society, our doctors, know little, if anyting, about nutrition; where our medical institutions denigrate the subject; where using prescription drugs and going to hospitals is the third leading cause of death? How did we get to place where advocating a plant-based diet can jeopardize a professional career, where scientists spend more time mastering nature than respecting it? How did we get to a place where the companies that profit from out sickness are the ones telling us how to be healthy; where the companies that profit from our food choices are the ones telling us what to eat; where the public's hard-earned money is being spent by the government to boost the drug industry's profits; and where there is more distrust than trust of our governments policies on foods, drugs and health?\"Dr. Campbell is not simply a writer or journalist, he is a distinguished professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University. This is a very important book for everyone to read, and it could have a major impact on your life. We need to follow the diets of people who show they are fit and healthy. I gotit on Kindle and its great. I read this book, did with diet, and took Dr. Campbell's Cornell online plant based course (an expensive investment). The book did break some myths about diet that I previously had, specifically that we don't need that much protein and carbs in their plant form do not inherently make you fat. I was already in good shape 190 8%bf and noticed great feelings initially, but they gradually began to fade. Others have found similar findings that the diet acts as almost as a cleanse, that gradually leaves you feeling lacking in something. It also allowed for more processed foods such as grain cereals/pastas/breads all whole wheat of course But after some common sense and other research, I really was not convinced that this is the ideal diet. After being very proud of my diet and touting its great benefits and I had to crawl back with my tail between my legs and admit I was wrong. I should also some \"myths' were true in myself. My hair and muscle tissue was also thinning out. I had a thick head of hair that my wife and mother commented was thinning. Since switch back, my hair is noticeably much thicker. My muscle tone while I was losing weight was also diminishing as my bf (usually at 7-8%) increased to 10-12%. Running on high on glucose and this diet does you'll also be wanting food more and more.There's just too many populations living healthy with animal products and have been for generations. I had to look no further than this truth in my own grandparents who lived on a farm and ate lard daily and both lived vibrantly into their 90's. I'm since back on a diet high on fat, lower on protein, and moderate carbs. Definitely feel better physically as compared to a vegan diet. Try it for yourself. Read Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food for a realistic down to earth stance on our current state of nutritional science. We are still in our infancy in understanding how food works in our bodies. Following a whole foods classical diet of eating with higher fat content, moderate protein, and a great deal of plants for many months, my blood pressure is low 111/68 bodyweight is still healthy at 190 8%bf I find no reason to ever go back to that style of eating.People will often tout the physiques of Dr. Campbell and other vegan authors, but look no further than the travel channel to see tribal elders with strong healthy looking bodies, not the frail looking physique of these guys. It's not an ego thing, but if you follow this diet and begin seeing yourself resembling an cancer patient, please go through some old national geographic pictures and ask if this is normal or healthy. We have a food problem in america that is related to big agribusiness, but this diet really only supports this. Join a CSA, take time to cook/prepare you food, and know where your food comes from. This is a good source of information for lay people to better understand the issues of health. It shows the reality and simpleness of getting free of fear and pursue good results. Really satisfactory results about taking control over our body. We've doing this for over 15 yrs and never even had a headake. Great book with solid research. It is opened my eyes to a plant based diet. To understand Campbell and his group, GOOGLE \"PCRM and PETA.\" They are the same animal! They are vegans promoting veganism. This is a sham. Campbell would have you believe that all doctors and nutritionists promoting a healthy well-balanced diet including milk, eggs, lean meat, fish, poultry... are only buying into propaganda by the milk and beef lobbys in D.C.This book spends little time on the China Study then leaps to conclusions that would have us eliminate milk/meat. It is a scary book, especially for growning children, unless you can get them to eat many, many cups of spinach a day.He spends a lot of time defending that he is not a quack. If he acts like one and sounds like one.... The China Study was recommended by my son who is a Chiropractor and recognized that I needed to change my eating habits. I have Prostate Cancer and am following some of the suggestions from the book. The research that has gone int this study is amazing and should be recommended reading for all parents that are concerned with the well-being of their children. What we have eaten throughout our lives has poisoned our systems and what we can learn from the studies done from observations of other countries is unbelievable. Nutrition is everything and adjustments to our diet will help us live longer, happier lives.",

         "The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)",
         "If you know the \"secret\" The Law of Attraction--this book gives you practical ways or techniques to use the Law Awesome possibilities that reach you each time you read this book....and you will read it many many many times for there are so many layers, realizations and understandings. The channeled Abraham says nothing you couldn't actually have thought of yourself, and at times I get the distinct feeling that I have read this or that almost word for word elsewhere in much older books.Now this may be 'coincidence' but we all know that pure coincidence does not exist. I doubt very much that all of its content was channeled, it just doesn't have the right feel and twist of phrasing about it.Nevertheless, a nice book as an introduction for the novice to the magical approach of living life. To those new to the material this book can look like be and end all of learning, but it isn't, and there is much more interesting stuff out there. Once you have mastered the basics - feel free to progress and have an adventure in cosnciousness. Don't just consume, be.I can also recommendThe Wizards of Consciousness: Making the Imponderable Practicaland any of the Bartholomew books like\"I Come As a Brother\": A Remembrance of Illusions. these too are easily accessible. I have listened again and again, the thoughts are GOLD! I truly appreciate the ideas and suggestions...it is amazing that this is so inspirational and magnificent. I can honestly suggest every single person should hear this treasure. I really enjoyed this book! this lays it out for you in a way you can understand that you always always always get the essence of what you think about. there are no exceptions. learn to see, think, and vibrate differently about every area of your life: home, relationships, career, money, health, government etc....and so attract the experiences you really want.really really great book with more insightful ideas made easily available for you to create the life you want!you are powerful. live your power with deliberate intent ~ I gotta say, I like their stuff. It's entertaining, and at the very least the message is positive.This Abraham character, that Esther \"channels,\" sounds more like Zsa Zsa Gabor than what I'd expect a highly evolved transdemensional being to sound like, but hey, it makes the message more fun. I won't get hung up on my feelings about channeling; because a wise man once taught me that it's not so much the messenger, but the message that counts.The message that I got from Esther's entity is basically this: Going about trying to change your world by running amok fixing everything outside of you is bass ackwards. Instead, fix your inner world with feelings like joy and that's what you'll create.I think Jesus said it this way in Mark 11:22-24. \"Have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, `Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\"Hey, if the Red Sox could use the power of belief to win the World Series after 80 years of disappointment, then this stuff must work.You may also want to check out \"The DaVinci Method\" for the secrets to overcoming your inner barriers to positive creating.Believe! This book is fantastic, it's processes along with easy to apply examples on how to follow them and bring your thoughts and feelings (vibration) into alignment with your desires enables an easy understanding of what is being taught by Abraham. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, even if you're not someone who believes in the whole non-physical side of life, it doesn't matter. Apply these teachings and processes and you'll see how much easier life begins to seem as you soften your resistance to what happening around you and begin to focus positively on yourself and start deliberately creating and letting in what it is you want in your life experience.If it's more money, better health, better thought management, feeling better about the annoying neighbours or better within yourself, this book explains it all and by applying and practicing you can have it all - Brilliant, BUY IT. As I read the first pages of this book I prepared myself to be disappointed as it began talking of \"channeling\". I believe that 90% of individuals that say they are channeling are merely scammers taking advantage of naive people.However, as I read further I was extremely impressed and in fact, found what I refer to as the missing link of positive thinking.Anyone who has read books on positive thinking, affirmations and the power of the subconscious mind, and attempted to put the methods into practice may have noticed that no matter how hard you try, sometimes it simply does not work.In this book it will tell you why and how you can change that.An excellent book, way overdue. Even better than the first book. Contains many easy to follow plans for manifesting anything you want. ....and it's fun, too ! With the clear aid of Esther and Jerry Hicks and Abraham, we are shown how to empower ourselves to live richer, fuller lives based on our true desires and intentions. Important work to be doing at this time. This book had some good ideas. However, there was a lot of repitition of ideas or filler, so to speak. This book is probably good for a \"beginner\" in learning about setting intentions and manifestation. Books by Wayne Dyer and Deepak Chopra have much more depth and better guidance concerning using \"intention\" to manifest what we want in life. This book is an amazing book. I highly recommend it. It has shown me about the choices I choose to make in life. Thank you Abraham Hicks for standing on the edge. As always I was able to find the product I was looking for and it did arrive as scheduled. No complaints! No complications! Amazon never fails me. Great book. I am more in every part or aspect of my life. After reading this book my mind was freed from stress. The truth and a natural understanding of what I am and what God is has set me free. Truly free. Wow life is so wonderful and this world so exciting. Thank you Abraham, Jerry/Esther Hicks. I've read a load of bestsellers on manifesting personal desires including this one, and I found they all have one thing in common - none mentioned karma, which I think is the ultimate challenge in fulfilling your desires. Why are so many people struggling with sickness every day? Why are there so many women looking for years for a mate? Is that because they don't desire them or they are not clear on their goals and desires? These books are there to make you feel empowered, but will your reality change? Not until they address how to overcome karma. And I hope one day, there will be a well-rounded book that talks about balancing desires and karma. I can't get enough of Abraham and Esther Hicks. However, I think much of this book is a repeat of the Ask and it is Given book - a life changing book! If this had been my first encounter with Abraham I might say the same thing about it. Abraham's messages have given me a wonderfully new, positive way to approach life. I'm able to make a lot more sense of the troubles of the world. Incorporating the philosophies of Abraham has made some very postive changes in my life. I will buy each and every book Abraham & Esther publish! Abraham has done it again in this wise and very helpful guide. It gives the reader a helpful perspective and program for how to go from how things are, to how one wants them to be.According to Abraham, we have two different aspects, you, and You. We proceed in life usually focused on the outward directed part, reacting to what-is, and making choices based on that. What we need to do is to get to a sense of envisioning how we would like things to be, and attuning our inner life and vibrations to manifest that.The book gives a series of exercises to help \"reframe\" thoughts about one's plights or worries, that lead to healthier emotional states. Working from healthier emotional states leads inexorably to better outcomes, and a joyful life. I found these exercises to be helpful and practical.The last part of the book is dialogues between Abraham (channeled through Esther Hicks) and guests/participants at Abraham-Hicks seminars. These dialogues are very good in showing the practical application of the teachings.I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is willing to approach the teachings with an open mind and a sincere desire to make healthy changes. It can be challenging, but that's the whole point, isn't it? I would also recommend that the reader be prepared to go over this material at least twice to grasp the concepts and begin to apply them to their own lives.It's the kind of work that goes well beyond the chatty self-help books that tell you how wonderful it is to achieve a blissful state, and how the author got there, but don't really give solid, practical help for the reader to do the same.This book is definitely empowering. Buy it! Esther and Jerry Hicks once again share their message from Abraham, all-loving teachers who are here to answer any of man's eternal and unique questions about our own, individual experience of the human condition. In a universe that is composed entirely of God's (or Source Energy's) love for us, all that we ever ask for is unconditionally and instantaneously given to us... and the very purpose of our life is to live in the joy of creating our own desires and finding perfect harmony with them!This material refines the same material of \"Ask and It Is Given\" into more specific, detailed examples of how to balance our own energy -- which is to say, to align our energy with the energy of the fulfillment of our desires, all of which have already been granted by God, or Source, so that we may live as we wish to live. The book helps us to approach the task of energy balancing in a step-by-step fashion for those of us who haven't quite gotten it down specifically and successfully yet!As always, the words are filled with love for us and our foibles, our hopes and dreams, and our willingness to expose ourselves to the \"contrast,\" or diversity of life, in the human race here on Earth. And they tell us how our living here in joy adds to the joy of the entire universe.All of the Abraham material is as uplifting as anything I've ever found anywhere. It may serve as an adjunct to more traditional spiritual pursuits or may stand on its own as your guide to the Universe, and how to get to wherever you want to be in your own life. It's always uplifting, and always a welcome message in my home!I, as many, can't thank Esther and Jerry enough for their enormous contribution to our well-being as we find answers to personal questions in this ongoing, evolving, and always-available dialogue!I also highly recommend their website, www.abraham-hicks.com, and their seminars and seminar CD's, on which you can find answers to questions on specific topics. While it could be argued that the basic premise of this second book is identical to that of its predecessor, it is also true that for every person who reads an idea presented one way, there are three others who won't quite absorb it at the aha! level until it's presented somewhat differently. There is no backpedaling in this from the revelations in Ask And It Is Given; however, the \"processes\" and different circumstances under which they may be utilized to get out of negative-thinking ruts and into a more conscious choice about what we allow to bang around in our heads, is presented with some fresh perspectives as Abraham's answering grows as a natural extension of people's asking. Esther is clearly an evolved channel. As a child I recall seeing my great- grandmother as a channel - her experience was like Esthers was initially. I remember seeing her shaking uncontrolably and drawing visitors from the village. I 100% believe everything Esther has to say and offer. Her words are indeed devine and have answered all my unanswered questions. Evry thing kind of falls in place - no human could possibly have all that information with no ocntradictions!I practised what she advises and have a calm sense of serenity ever since. The Stock market decline doesn't bother me anymore..I know all the fianncial mess the US finds itself in will be ok in 2009! By far the best book Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product! Great condition of book and fast delivery This is a must read book if you are looking for peace of mind and happiness. The book offers specific clear instructions on how to bring your desires and your beliefs into alignment. Very enlightening book. If you look on the positive side of things more often you will feel better about the negative things and help to make the outcome positive. Good reading. \"Ask and It Is Given\" just blew me away, and once I had really read it through several times (and started having success in manifesting), I wondered what else there was. I found my way to the Abraham-Hicks website where I was able to download a long recording of Abraham actually speaking. Wow.I then noticed another book available, \"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\", and its table of contents preview seemed to suggest that there was lots of new material inside.UPSIDE: \"Deliberate Intent\" contains some vibration-raising exercises for relationship problems, work-related problems, etc. that go further than the first book.It also includes transcripts of sessions where people actually asked Abraham for help with their own personal problems (Abraham Live-Questions and Answers). A lot of it was surprising. I wish there had been more of that, because it was so educational.DOWNSIDE: A lot of the book covers exactly the same material as does \"Ask and It Is Given\", only it is worded and organized differently.I don't think it's so much a problem of the authors \"padding\", as it is this: the process of manifesting as laid out by Abraham is deceptively simple; so simple in fact, that one can only elaborate on it so much and that's it.\"Ask and It Is Given\" is still my all-time favorite book of this genre, and I rate it one star higher than \"Deliberate Intent\". They are both good books, but the former will always be the magical key of manifesting for my money. In a word, AWESOME. This book is easy to read and follow. Very inspirational. They just keep getting better and better. Can't wait for the next book to come out... I've loved Abraham's work for years. Intent is such a powerful force in our lives whether we use it consciously or not. I wish everyone would allow themsevles to be happy - what a world this would be!!! Imagine a world full of happy people!!!This is a must read.",

         "Telling us how great your philosophy is? Awesome.Telling us how terrible other ways are? A bit heavy-handed, mayhaps. Surprisingly wordy given the topic. Cute drawings though and I like the idea of it more than the book. Maybe reading the originals with the same light might be more interesting. This book is a delightful little read - it aims to put Taoism in practical and friendly terms by looking at Whinnie the Pooh, and succeeds at this.The writing style is engaging and makes for a fast read.If there's any down side, it's that sometimes a slight bitter tone from the author comes through at. But all in all it's a very worthwhile read; I've read it twice and have recommended it to several friends/family. If you can read this book and keep in mind it is not trying to rape you of your deep &quot;spirituality&quot; and it is simply simple. If you don't like the idea of the Tao being discussed vaguely, then why did you buy a book titled &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;? I enjoyed the way he explained the Tao with Pooh who we can all relate to at times. If you are looking for a deeper book, try not reading books, because no, you will not find true enjoyment of like in a book. I suggest drilling a hole in your scull so you can find your Nirvana. I personally would rather to reach that state of mind through meditation, and, here is the secret key, life. You can reach me at jason@shimainc.net I had to read this book for my IB Theory of Knowledge class. It has truly given me a fresh perspective on life.The most interesting thing about this adorable book is the connections he makes between us and all the characters of Winnie the Pooh: Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Pooh, Tiger, and Owl. According to him, the majority of the time we want to be efficient Rabbit or learned Owl.But is this really what we want? Or are we merely conforming to society and the prestige marked behind these characteristics?Us IB kids are stereotypically known for always being on the run- running but never knowing where we're going half the time. This is really not far from the truth. In this generation, the focus for all high-achieving high school students is usually to enter a prestigious college. But the probelm is, most of us never have any idea what we want from our lives let alone what major to decide on. This book is so relevant because it takes the time to bring up all the choices that most of us are making so lightly or beliving we have none.In The Tao of Pooh, Pooh emerges as the unlikely hero and truly the wisest of them all. It has given me a new outlook on the world and the meaning of our actions and choices.Another little bonus is a raise in optimism. =] This boxed set is a lovely excursion into the world of Pooh and the Tao. The books are the size of a small novel and come in a sturdy box that fits them snugly. The corners of the box get a little bent in shipping, and because the books are paperback the covers roll up a little. But they are a great size & shape for travel, and they fulfill their promise of wisdom and a fun journey through philosophy through the eyes and lives of the Pooh Corner characters. A wonderful treat! Desiring an understanding of Taoism lead me to The Tao of Pooh. Unexpectedly, Pooh metamorphised into some sort of mythological character. Distancing myself I could understand how this may appear to be a novelty. But I assure you, it is not. Through Pooh Hoff explains the tenets of Taosim. I was impressed with the philosophical and practical points presented. Though I felt, and this was probably be design, that there is more. That Taoism demands further study. In any event, an excellant introductory. Pooh just it. The Tao of Pooh/CassettesBenjamin Hoffextremely devistated that the cd have been stopped, can you please find me an audio cd of this Even if you don't know anything about Tao or Pooh, this book is entertaining and enlightening. I would think that anyone would benefit from reading this book. The way it is written really makes it easy to read and absorb. It's a must read! This book should have been listed in schools for a book-list in every language. When you know this, you see that life can be fun and easy. When we were covering Taoism in my World Religions class, I suddenly recalled the Tao of Pooh book my sister-in-law gave me the year I planned to end it all, back in 1995/96. I read it once, was comforted by it, and forgot it all. Years later, after reading Taoism, I instantly felt a light bulb flash in my head... &quot;Oh, so that's what it's all about!&quot; This cute book combines the Taoist philosophy in conjunction with Pooh's interractions with his friends, with Christopher Robin being the kind but serious teacher who tries to teach Pooh about what he represents--Taoism.In contrasting Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Confucius is described as a sour-faced man, Buddha as one with a bitter expression, but Lao-Tse being the smiling one. Basically, the laws that govern the heavens are the same one that govern earth and man, and that if we go with the flow, we'll be in harmony.The concepts of wu-wei is also explained. Wu-wei means &quot;not doing&quot; but of doing nothing against the natural flow. Here, it's called the Pooh Way, because Pooh has a &quot;mind that merely sees what's in front of it, and follows the nature of things.&quot; In other words, put the round peg in the round hole, the square peg in the square one.The characters who make up Pooh's friends demonstrate the flaw of knowledge and cleverness, and I was fascinated and sobered by this because their personalities reflect me, and I realize the bad side in knowing too much.Dig this: Owl, the modern equivalent of a Confusionist, Dessicated Scholar, is described as someone who gains Knowledge for Knowledge's sake, or for the sake of appearing wise. A bit harsh because that's me to some extent. Rabbit is described as someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of appearing Clever, and I had to wince, because to my shame, I fully admit that's also me to some extent. And Eeyore is someone who gains Knowledge for the sake of Complaining. Given my political stance, yes, me too again. And as Pooh says in response to Owl having a brain, &quot;I suppose that that's why he never understands anything.&quot; Maybe that's my problem too.But Pooh, the lucky bear, may not have much of a brain, but he embodies the Simplicity of the Uncarved Block, the Taoist equivalent of John Locke's tabula rasa (blank slate). Basically, Pooh can't describe the Uncarved Block, he just IS it. &quot;That's the nature of the Uncarved Block.&quot;And he's got the right idea in not being a Bisy Backson, or (Busy Back Soon), you know, rush-rush-rush. I wonder why we don't have an American equivalent of a French sidewalk cafe or Chinese teahouse. Now that I'm getting on, maybe I value the message of &quot;You're important. Relax and enjoy yourself.&quot;A cute book on the explanations of Taoism, and how maybe simplicity, wisdom (as opposed to knowledge) and contentment is the best way to go. But it makes me wish that I was a tabula rasa or an Uncarved Block once again. Oh, just to be, not to know or be clever, but just to be. This book is garuanteed to give you a different outlook on life, if you actually think about what you are reading. I recently mailed this book to a friend that lives in the UK, and I have never seen anyone more appreciative in my whole life. It offers any type of person a perspective that let's you live life the way every person should. And who better to explain this than Pooh bear? I would hope that this book makes all people realize that we are what we are, and we need everyone else in order to be what we are. This book offers appreciation of everything in existence. I hope that you are capable of understanding (and wanting to understand) the things there are to be learnt by this book. This elegant and well-written volume by Benjamin Hoff, along with its sequel &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot;, is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing about Taoism in the West. Having just read and enjoyed the original Pooh stories by A.A. Milne, I became intrigued by this book and obtained it. As soon as I opened it I could not find a good point to lay it down. I kept reading and reading until I finished it in a single day. The book was so pleasurable, so well-written, and so intriguing. I kept thinking and imagining all the different concepts of Taoism that this book introduces me to. &quot;Wu Wei&quot; or effortless action; living in harmony with nature; Nowhere and Nothing; the importance of the present; the extreme alienation we in the West create for ourselves by being constantly busy. These are all important issues that relate to my life personally, and I feel I have gained something from reading this book, in addition to spending an enjoyable time reading it.Those who didn't like this book for some reason are missing the point. The &quot;Tao of Pooh&quot; was never meant to be the definite treatise on Taoism, or the dispassionate comparison of East and West. As a matter of fact, this book is classified under &quot;Humor&quot;. In fact, it is this humor of pooh which lends itself so aptly to introducing Taoism. Since reading this book, I became interested in reading the other book by John Tyerman Williams called &quot;Pooh &amp; the Philosophers&quot;. What a disaster that turned out to be! See, the defining character of Pooh is that he never really takes himself seriously, which is perfectly in line with the attitude of major Taoist philosophers. Yet Western philosophy thinks of itself as a serious subject, an attitude that is quite un-Pooh-ish, so I don't know what on earth Williams was thinking in using Pooh to illustrate Western philosophy. Anyways, don't buy William's book, buy this! If you like Pooh and feel intrigued with Eastern Philosophy, you will find a pleasurable reading in this masterpiece that was the first to recognize this beautiful match. This text arrived in more than adequate time.I recommend this text to spiritual practitioners as a base text, and children.Along with its Brother text The Te of Piglet. \"The Tao of Pooh\" is a good book as an introduction to Taoism. The book does not only present Taoism in a very simple way; the involvement of Pooh makes the book very enjoying.I was afraid that this book will assume some knowledge about Pooh, which I have only watched a handful of time - a couple of years ago. Thankfully the book only uses characters of Pooh to present the ideas, rather than make this another Pooh story. I JUST LOVED IT , MAKES YOU SMILE ALL THE WAY The Tao of Pooh is a wonderful, simple explanation of the basic tenets of Taoism. It is not the end-all-be-all of Taoism reference, but for those of us interested in learning more about Eastern Thought, it is a delightfully entertaining way of doing so.I don't think Pooh knew he was quite the philosopher, and I'm not sure A. A. Milne intended him to be, but it turns out that he explains basic Taoism very well.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about basic Taoism, wants to make positive changes in their lives, or who just loves Pooh and has an open mind. Hurrah for Western Civilization, the predominant culture-set on the planet!Benjamin Hoff allows his Neo-Luddite hate speech to infiltrate his otherwise half-witted diatribe against academia, work, and progress. (How is it that most &quot;progressives&quot; I've met feel a need to romanticize about a *past* that never existed?) While saying that conservatives, scholars, and people who *do* rather than pontificate, are WRONG, this joker talks about the gentle Chinese and all their contributions to society.How can one, logically, bemoan the fate of Tibet while praising the Chinese for their cultural sensitivity? How can one, logically, complain about the ecology in the US in contrast to China (Maybe Chinese industrial waste is just culturally superior to ours?). We have protesters here in the US. We just don't run them over with military hardware. Those culturally sensitive Chinese are just GREAT!This is not to say that the Chinese are bad. How can a civilization that brought us Kung Pao Chicken be all *that* bad? Let us, however, be fair. Eastern Civilizations have been every bit as cruel as Western ones. Hoff would do well to learn that, worldwide, people have been miserable t@rds to each other for ages. He complains about a culture that allows dissent; I suspect that this disdain stays with him all the way to the bank. If he were to be critical *of* China *in* China, he may well find that his royalty checks would be found under &quot;Contraband Property&quot; and that *he* would be found under a tank.If you want to find out about Taoism read a book on Taoism. If you want to read frantic rants about Western culture, Hoff's books may be for you. A very quick and addicting read that educate's the reader on Taoism in a most unusual and original way. Even if you are not interested in Taosim, philosophy, ect. this book will strike you as both informative and entertaining. People. It is a beautiful spring day today. The sun is shining, a warm breeze is caressing, the clouds are puffy cotton, the squirrels are scurrying and the birds are chirping. (Which is o.k. as long as they don't fly overhead!). Your Metamorpho decided to take his pen and pad to the ol' babbling brook to get into the reflective mood to write this next review. I sat down against an old oak tree and started to write. However, it was so peaceful I started to doze off. In the middle of envisioning Sondra the Seerest doing her latest belly dance, I felt a furry hand tugging at my white linen cuff.\"Wake up Mr. Metamorpho, wake up!\" a voice said. I blinked my eyes open to find Pooh there, face full of honey.\"Oh it's you Pooh,\" I said with surprise. \"Funny you should be here. I was just going to write about you.\"\"You were?\" he said with eyes wide open. \"Why?\"\"Well, because I'm here writing a review of Benjamin Hoff's book called 'The Tao of Pooh', which is about you.\"\"It is?\" he asked. \"Wow!\"\"No, Tao Pooh\", I corrected.\"What is Tao Mr. Metamorpho?\" he asked with a puzzled look.\"Well, I think it is one of the great teachings of China. A philosopy of sorts. Mr. Hoff equates this with how you are. An uncarved block, as he puts it.\"\"He thinks I'm a blockhead?\" Pooh said, as a lone tear started to form.\"No no Pooh. Even though you are a bear of simple brain, Mr. Hoff explains that you are not stupid, but representative of the simplicity one needs to lead a calm and natural life. Go with the flow, if you will.\"\"That sounds better,\" he smiled.\"Sure does. The concept of Tao is very interesting, but, essentially the belief is that there is constant evolution in the world. In other words, there is a natural balance in nature and the universe. It is the concept that total harmony will be achieved by letting things be, to run their own course, if you will.\"\"I ran a course once, along with Kanga and Roo,\" he said smiling.\"Well, it's not exactly like that,\" I said. \"You see Pooh, he believes in yin and yang. Two energies that, although opposite, are complimentary and needed for harmony. This applies to many facets of life.\"\"Maybe I should ask owl,\" he said.\"Well, you could,\" I said. \"But he makes a distinction here between knowledge and true wisdom. The answers don't lie in a book per se, they just are, within yourself, if you are aware of the interconnectivity of all things in the universe.\"\"You mean I am?\" he said with surprise.\"Mr. Hoff seems to thinks so. And I wouldn't apply this to any of your friends. Rabbit never slows himself down long enough to recognize the simple pleasures of life,\" I said. \"Eeyore, well, you know Eeyore, he brays over things he can't control. And Piglet, although very small, is uncertain and afraid to take action.\"\"I'm hungry. Do you have a jar of honey with you?\" he asked.\"No, but I have this,\" and I handed him a honey graham cracker. \"There is much more to this philosophy, but the main thing is that the only constant in the universe is change. If you war against it you will only produce unnatural and artificial results, which could produce much unhappiness because it goes against the natural rythmn and flow of life.\"\"I don't think I am unhappy Mr. Metamorpho,\" he said.\"No Pooh, you aren't,\" I smiled. \"You are a living, breathing, stuffed example of Tao.\"\"Well, Mr. Metamorpho, I'm not stuffed yet. No honey, huh?\"\"No, Pooh. But, I have no doubt that you will find it. Tao provides beary nice things for those who follow the path.\"\"Thanks Mr. Metamorpho. Speaking of path, I should go find Christopher Robin. He should be home about now,\" he said and then sauntered off.And people, if you have read this so far, you will know I will take full advantage of the deus ex machina (a popular method in Greece) to tell you that when I woke up, I remembered this meeting word for word, and wrote it here for your amazement. Now, let me get back to my daydream of Sondra. It was a very pleasurable experience, but I wished she would stop fluttering those stupid silk scarfs in my face. The things one puts up with for love. I tell ya.For the child in all of us -- Metamorpho I loved this book so much that I am giving it as gifts to all those on a journey of self-discovery. The book really helps you see situations from a really wonderful perspective & presents you with positive perspectives! A great book for anyone! Hoff uses Pooh Bear and all of the other characters from Winnie the Pooh to ease a seeker into understanding Buddhism, Taoism and the general balance of the universe, a little bit better. This book was different from many other books on Buddhism/Taoism, in that it is playful and imaginative, rather than concrete and absorbed in discipline and standards. I think that this is a great read for anybody interested in the Asian religions, who also can appreciate the cute, yet meaningful metaphors that Hoff offers within this book. I found this to be a wonderful book that uses delightful stories to express views on life and the current world. This book gives you the feeling that there is hope, and that we are all capable of being wise. It is also pleasant to read and very positive. I think that everybody everywhere should read this book. The Tao of Pooh is, I believe, an attempt at presenting the philosophy of Taoism in an entertaining and cute way using the familiar, and entertaining-in-themselves, characters of Winnie the Pooh. However, I think that if you would like to learn about Taoism, you'd be better off reading a blurb off of a website. As for using the Winnie the Pooh characters to emphasize, illustrate and entertain, well, it just didn't work. In Hoff's \"take\" on Taoism, he tactlessly insults and irritates the average person living in Western Civilization who has any goals or aspirations in life. There are some very nice beliefs in Taoism, such as the development of divine virtues (which is not, of course, unique to Taoism but is shared by almost all religions), such as compassion and caring. However, being an ancient philosophy, many of the concepts and ideas have outdated themselves for today's society. Even so, it is difficult to fully appreciate the peacefulness and simplicity of this philosophy with so many jabs thrown by Hoff along the way. Poor Pooh! The Tao of Pooh and the Te of Piglet are intended to introduce readers to \"the way\" of life in a comfortable and down to earth manner. The books are filled with legends, stories, and examples. It is a wonderful application of Eastern beliefs to Western culture. Personally, I found them to be enlightening books focused on what a philosophy of life may look like and how spirituality can be constructed. `The Tao of Pooh', a fascinating synthesis of Eastern philosophy and Western children's literature, is done largely in conversational style between Benjamin Hoff, erstwhile writer, photographer and musician with a penchant for forests and bears. Thus, Pooh makes a natural philosophical companion. But, more than a companion, Pooh is, for Hoff, the very embodiment of the Tao.`It's about how to stay happy and calm under all circumstances!' I yelled.'Have you read it?' asked Pooh.This is two-way book: to explain Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh, and to explain Winnie-the-Pooh (not always an easy task itself) through Taoism. Taoism, more academically, is a religion indigenous to China, built upon teachings primarily of Lao-tzu, with significant influence from Buddha and K'ung Fu-tse. It is in the teachings of harmony and emptiness and being of Lao-tzu, however, that Taoism draws its meaning, believing that earth is a reflection of heaven, and that the world `is not a setter of traps but a teacher of valuable lessons.'As with many religions, this one took various guises: philosophic, monastic, structural, folk. But through them all, the imperceptible Tao, the essence of being, essentially undescribable, shapes the universe continually out of chaos, with a yin and yang alteration of perpetual transformation, in which nothing remains eternal save the Tao.This makes Pooh a perfect example and exemplar. `For the written character P'u, the typical Chinese dictionary will give a definition of 'natural, simple, plain, honest.' P'u is composed of two separate characters combined: the first, the 'radical' or root-meaning one, is that for tree or wood; the second, the 'phonetic' or sound-giving one, is the character for dense growth or thicket.'Through semantic changes, perfectly in keeping with the Tao, we find that Pooh, or P'u, is actually a tree in the thicket, or a wood not cut, or finally, an Uncarved Block. And this, of course, is what pure being is.Pooh, in his journey through the Tao, with the Tao, of the Tao (it is a hard one to nail down, isn't it?) encounters many. This includes Eeyore, the terminally morose, who represents Knowledge for the sake of Complaining about Something. It also includes Owl, the Western successor of the 'Confucianist Dedicated Scholar', who believes he has all truth as his possession, and studies Knowledge for the Sake of Knowledge (even if it isn't always the best knowledge). `You can't help respecting anybody who can spell TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but spelling isn't everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday simply doesn't count.'Of course, all of the knowledge of the Owl, accompanied by the variable helpfulness of Rabbit who cannot stop activity in favour of just being something, couldn't figure out what had become of Christopher Robin, who left the Very Clear Note on his door:GON OUTBACKSONBISYBACKSONWho or what is a Backson? Backsons are those people trying to outrun their shadows and their footprints, not realising that to stand still and rest in the shade defeats the power of both. And of course, the Bisy Backson is never at a standstill. And of course, one cannot experience the Tao, be the Tao, know the Tao (well, you get the Tao) if one is perpetually on the run.The Bisy Backson is alwaysGONE OUTBACK SOONBUSYBACK SOONor, maybe GONE SOON. Anywhere. Anywhere he hasn't been. Anywhere but where he is. Of course, the idea of not going anywhere is abhorrent to him, and there is no concept of being able to do nothing.Nothingness frees the mind. Nothing works like nothing. For there is nothing to distract you. Nothing to get in the way. Nothing to hinder you. Nothing means anything.Now, read that last sentence again, carefully.Nothing means anything.Any thing is by definition itself, but when it is no thing, it can become potentially any thing.'Oh, I see,' said Pooh.Wisdom lies in the way of Pooh, who shirks the busy-ness of Rabbit, the intellectual hubris of Owl, and the doom-saying of Eeyore. Pooh simply is, and enjoys being who he is. Pooh is a Master, who knows the Way. Learn from him. Learn to be with him. Mr. Hoff, in quoting &quot;The Vinegar Tasters&quot;, may have misunderstood Buddhism. As a Buddhist, with some experience, I have never looked at the Universe as a 'setter of traps' nor am I embittered by life on earth. Just saddened. More likely, we are the generators of illusion and are working out our karma. Buddhism is more in accord with finding the lessons of our lives in our karma and taking responsibility. We do not turn away from the 'dust of the world'. We wipe it from our eyes.Other than the above, I find joyful calm in its reading. This book is based around the idea that A. A. Milne's stories of Winnie-The-Pooh can be used to illustrate the basic notions of Taoism. Hoff is not by any means arguing that Milne was a Taoist. He is merely saying that Milne's inner attitude to life, as revealed by the stories, intuitively follow along the same path as Taoism. Owl is wise, Rabbit is cleaver and Eeore is smugly superior but the real hero of the books is Pooh, the apparently stupid yet strangely successful and able bear.The book covers the Taoist principles of:Tao, or the indescribable Way of the universe,P'u, or natural simplicity, the Uncarved Block,Inner Nature, being those things that make us exactly who we are,Wu Wei, or proceeding without doing, causing, or making,Tzu Jan, or 'self so', meaning that things happen by themselves, spontaneously,Tz'u, or caring and compassion, and,T'ai Hsu, or the Great Nothing.Along the way we learn the pitfalls of being too busy and the benefits of doing nothing (for example meditation and contemplation). Having read this I now try to arrange my day so that I can spend half an hour a day in my garden with my cat just doing nothing but observing nature and thinking the thoughts that come to mind. I recommend it to everyone. Benjamin Hoff uses Winnie the Pooh to teach Taoist principles. The book is a quick and easy read, as I am sure the author intended as way to reflect his subject matter. Tao or \"the Way\" has always been a somewhat mysterious and inaccessible philosophy for me. Perhaps that's the result of my over-westernized mind. Whenever I read a treatise on the Tao, I am always left with the feeling that I have only touched the surface of the teaching and that I would need to enroll in a some long term course before I get it. This book leaves me with the same feeling. I did, however, glean some important teachings, like how one must try to stick to his own nature, how it's better to go with the flow than to be hyperorganized, and how our culture's acquisitiveness has resulted in mindless consumerism and the threat to our planet's viability. I was also impressed by the teaching on Tai Chi, where practitioners do not confront force with force but use deflection and evasive tactics to overcome their enemy, a technique that should be used more often in other areas of life. So, maybe I did get more than I expected. In any case, it's fun and comforting to have Winnie the Pooh and his character friends on the journey to learning the Tao. Read and enjoy.",

         "Lana VilmainPHR, M EdHuman Resource Generalist, Employee Developmentlvilmain@aol.comI highly recommend this book and plan to read others by the same author.The research team spent over five years compiling the research. Some of the research goes back 100 years; while a couple of the examples are not current it all has an empirical basis. The author made a point toward the end of the book that I found very interesting. Essentially, the book's findings indicated that it was more important to find an employee that matched an organization's core values and purpose than necessarily a skill set. A company should get the right employees in the door and then find the position where they're most suited at that time. Then, the employee would be acclimated to the company and prepared for the next suitable move within the organization.Lana VilmainPHR, M EdHuman Resource Generalist, Employee Developmentlvilmain@aol.com Because of the thorough research, this book is far superior to virtually all other business books. Over the last 30 years I've read over 100 books that profess to be able to help a business improve, and, while most have value, none that I've read have been as valuable to my business as Good to Great.We implemented the concepts about 3 years ago and have reaped the benefits since. I can't recommend this book enough. Good to Great is a very interesting exploration of corporate evolution. Jim Collins set out to attempt to understand the process of transformation that causes some companies to transition to much higher levels of performance than they have historically evidenced, and to sustain a level of results that significantly outperforms both comparative companies and the market in general.The author and his research team were rigorous in setting aside preconceived notions of the variables that might account for such cases of radical change. The only characteristics they looked for to identify the subject companies were seemingly sudden performance breakthroughs that were sustained for at least fifteen years. These organizations were compared to each other as well as to a set of comparison companies (those with significant shared characteristics with the exception of performance breakthrough).The high performance variables that were identified by the study were those that good to great companies had in common with one another, but not with the group of comparison companies.The characteristics that set these companies apart are not at all what one might have anticipated, and therein lies much of the interest of the research.How might the book itself have transitioned to greatness? I wish Collins would have included more analysis as to how the factors he identified resulted in the documented performance breakthroughs. This would have provided the reader with more content for application and in so doing would have moved Good to Great from very good to great. I have been in business for 25 years mostly as a top executive for Xeorx and then Intel. I consider it my obligation to continue to improve myself at every level in order to maintain my career and stay ahead of the internal competition. To me it is not just a credo it is a way of life and one that has served me well over the years and put three girls through college. Nothing has ever helped more than improving my leadership skills. My top two books this quarter are mostly bestsellers such as Emotionally Charged Learning by Eric Schiffer and \"Good to Great\" by Jim Collins. Emotionally Charged Learning taught me how to be a better \"knowledge\" oriented leader which gives me more power to have my employees better excel. Good to Great taught me to take another look at what really works. These books have been essential to me and my ongoing success. It's impossible to overstate how many lessons there are in this work. For organizational leaders this is a must read. Multiple insights here with practical application for those who want to build sustainable and transformational agencies. Thank you, Jim! With all due respect to Mr. Jim Collins, what he spent 4-5 years researching and writing 200+ pages on, could have been said by an undergraduate economics major from any university off the block in less than 5 pages.I started this book as an assignment for my upcoming internship in NY for IBM, and was expecting some really great concepts, kind of the ones that make you sit up and think about what is trying to be conveyed. But the concepts presented in this book almost mock the reader's intelligence. Neither is it an academic read, nor an intellectually promising one. For example, if you're not going to be disciplined in your work and with the hiring of your staff, then what exactly will you be? undisciplined and expect your company to soar to new heights? The same goes for hiring the right people. who're you gonna hire? the wrong ones? An organization doesn't actively pursue people who are not of high calibre and then pay them a salary to not do their job and much more. also, face the brutal facts? I highly doubt CEOs are acting on their whim in lalaland. We're talking about the brutal corporate america. Things aren't hidden well and neither do people have short memories when it comes to deception and lies.The only 2 concepts I thought were important were the Hedgehog Concept and the Technology Accelerators. People (including myself) often mistake a complex plan to be the right one, and thid chapter does a good job in removing that myth. The same goes for technology. A new technology can temporarily make a company good, perhaps great, but it's the ability to use that technology in the right manner and in the right ways that determines it's economic growth/decline in the future.Though I am new to Corporate America, there are basic concepts that I even know and understand. Unfortunately, Mr. Jim Collins does not provide me with the challenge, nor the promising pursuit in business that I was looking for. I've had this book on my short list to read for the last few years but was not compelled to start because of my bias that an academic can't possibly understand the underpinnings of business like a CEO/Executive/Entreprenuer with real-world experience. After finaly reading this book, I was definitely convinced otherwise. Good to Great is based on thousands of hours of investigation by a team of researchers rather than just antecodotal evidence and personal opinions that comprise many other business books. The research methodology, while not perfect, seems to be about as good as you could get based on the infinite number of variables within the business environment. Jim Collins does an excellent job of distilling the finding of his research team into an extremely well written, concise book full of beneficial statistics, case studies, interviews, references and stories of the individual companies selected from the study. I really feel that there are real nuggets of wisdom in this book and I am better off for having read it. I can't wait to read his previous work, Built to Last. I like this book, it is a very good research, very clear concepts and common practices found among the selected 'great' companies. All the comments you will find of people rating it 4-5 stars is right.My only point as I was reading it (post 2008-2009 crisis) is to whether Fannie Mae and Circuit City are supposed to be considered 'Great' companies. shipment went well. No problems. The book is pretty dry. It's informative but long. If you like business, i'd recommend it. It's a must read for any business man or women. If you've already read it, read it again. :) I really loved this book because it not only made perfect sense for a company or a company leader in designing a future, it illustrated many real-life examples that supported the books themes. Perhaps the most enlightening was the simple, yet fierce adherence to a few basic principles that one must carry to go from Good to Great! This book introduces a management methodology that Collins and his team discovered by analyzing eleven carefully selected companies. Out of hundreds of researched companies, only these eleven firms have changed from good to great and sustained their status. Remarkably, these eleven companies transformed under the same process of buildup followed by breakthrough, which can be broken into three broad stages, each driven by two key concepts:1. Disciplined people: Level 5 leadership and First who...Then what2. Disciplined thought: Confront the brutal facts (yet never lose faith) and The Hedgehog concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)3. Disciplined action: A culture of discipline and Technology acceleratorsWrapping around this entire framework is a concept of flywheel, which, under disciplined people, thought, and action, accumulates inertia and takes the company from good to great.The book illustrates this methodology with multiple examples and specific and detailed rules that can help entrepreneurs in various businesses turn their companies from good to great. A great reading for any entrepreneur.Yuval Lirov, Practicing Profitability - Billing Network Effect for Revenue Cycle Control in Healthcare Clinics and Chiropractic Offices: Collections, Audit Risk, SOAP Notes, Scheduling, Care Plans, and Coding With all and much due respect to the other reviewers, specifically those with backgrounds in data research and business owners taking a negative lean on Good to Great concepts, I think they've missed both the point and the appeal of this piece. This book does what many fail to do, it takes the touchy-feely ideals of people oriented structure and, for the very first time, supports them with pure data. Other books either take the strong dollar line describing how to logically move money from one place to another to make more money or go the complete opposite, describing how to be one with the universe and perfectly in tune with your failing business. OHM!Sure, I'll be the first one to agree that the data herein may not be processed to the point of mathematical certainties, but that is simply the nature of the assertions it is trying to make. This book looks into the past, it searches for the data, rather than telling me how to better run a business in the future with no explanation as to why I should say \"bless you\" every time an employee sneezes. Good To Great shows how the compassionate in balance with the passionate is not just the guru of the week's feel-good clich&eacute;, but a methodology that CAN work. Mr. Collins does not seem to assert, at all, that these methods WILL work. Instead he and his team have virtually proven that a construct more in tune with the people can be a staggering money maker.I think the problem with this book is the crowd to which it appeals. Frankly, it is hard to imagine anyone apart from a business owner, a wanna-be business owner, or a statistician ever pulling it off the shelf. As such, these are the very people who will most easily scoff at the findings as they are probably part of the problem. If one is already increasing his/her profit margin solely via massive layoffs, of course s/he is not going to agree with sticking things out over time, changing people's positions, or cutting his/her own salary. Your method is working in the short term. Blame the data, blame the conclusions if you will. The little nugget of gold, to me, is that Good to Great shows that a dedicated, but employee friendly structure, CAN make as much doe as the big guns. It has completely blown away the idea that the hard line is the way things must be done.If you are a potential reader who is NOT looking for the SECRET of running a business and who is NOT looking to refute the SECRET of running a business, the issues demonstrated herein are very rewarding. Collins essentially compares several companies that were maintaining a good status quo before skyrocketing and holding the orbit for 15 years to as many other companies poised in the same position, but which failed to do the same. The data often referenced in the text is droves of articles published about these companies during the times of the skyrocket. Sounds dry to your everyday reader, but when stretched out end to end, the results are quite compelling. Unlike what is written by other reviewers, the conclusions are not simple matters of getting the right people in the right place at the right time. Rather, they are often proof that counter-corporate concepts and actually losing money while these more human concepts take shape can result in yielding enough revenue to throw down with the big boys. I don't know about you, but every time I see a person second guessing their technique or approach to life because Joe Corporate makes more money quicker, it pains me. Joe Corporate has actual data to harvest. His numbers yield numbers making everything easy to see. Doesn't make him any more personable. Finally the people people of the world have data to support their own processes without hard liners thinking them foolish.Essentially, this book is top line because it is HOW to go from good to great, not WHAT it takes to make the leap. A WHAT is easily disproved. Yet, there can be a million HOWs. This is one of them.Be forewarned, as the set of companies examined are often rehashed to illustrate the conclusions to each chapter, the read gets a tad repetitive if you are not focused. Other than that, however, it is an easy read, common speak. There is no Mr. Hawking to this book, just a buddy who did the work for you. I found 'Good to Great' a fascinating read. The book is peppered with fabulous examples of companies who have achieved greatness and those who haven't, and why. James C. Collin, the author of this book, is a business consultant, author, and lecturer on the subject of company sustainability and growth. He frequently contributes to Harvard Business Review, Business Week, Fortune and other magazines and journals.What is prominent about the book \"Good to Great\" is that it doesn't attribute corporate success to a single set of factor. Instead, it makes you think differently about the conventional wisdoms and rules of thumbs which are frequently (and falsely) associated with prominent organizations.Collins encourages to lead with questions, not answers; to engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion; to conduct autopsies without blame; and to build red flag mechanisms that turn information into information that cannot be ignored. The concept of making tough questions was first embraced by Ronald Heifetz in his book \"Leadership Without Easy Answers\", but it is more focused to individuals, while \"Good to Great\" mostly spotlights an organization as a whole.There is another prominent book about great companies: \"Leading the Revolution\" by Gary Hamel. While Hamel mostly draws attention to technology accelerators, Collins, in contrast, cautions that technology should not be regarded as a potential panacea for all that ails a company. The folly of this kind of thinking was revealed in the aftermath of the crash of the tech bubble in the early 2000s. Collins contends that the good-to-great companies approach the prospect of new and emerging technologies with the same prudence and careful deliberation that characterizes all of their other business decisions. Review of: \"Good to Great - Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't\"By: Jim CollinsThe book \"Good to Great\" is a report on the results of a lengthy business research study. Jim Collins and a team of researchers asked the question: \"Why do some companies make the leap from being good companies to being great companies, and why not others?\" Over the course of the book this foundational question is asked several different ways.In chapter eight of \"Good to Great\" the author says that the fundamental question a CEO should ask is: \"What can we do better than any other company in the world, that fits our economic denominator and that we have passion for?\" (Page 180)In chapter nine of \"Good to Great\" the author introspectively asked what motivated him to undertake the huge project in the first place. His motivation was to understand man's search for meaning, in his own words: \"... why greatness ... the search for meaning, or more precisely, the search for meaningful work.\" (Page 208)Jim Collins' previous book, \"Built to Last\" (NS) is a description of sustained greatness in American companies. After publishing \"Built to Last\" the author asked how companies got to be great in the first place. \"Good to Great\" answers that question.Book SummaryJim Collins and a team of twenty researchers studied the difference between companies that are good and companies that become great. The definition of greatness was made in very practical terms. A great company yields a sustained high return to the owners. For this research a high yield was seven times the general stock market over a fifteen-year period. The study took 10 years of researcher effort and resulted in 2,000 pages of interview transcripts.The change from \"good to great\" is guided by, what the author calls, a level five leader. The common characteristics of level five leaders are: modesty, humility, willfulness, courage and company orientation. Level five leaders are unselfish.Executive compensation plans don't matter between good and great companies. The important thing is that they are reasonable and fair. Executive compensation has to make sense, but will not move a company from \"good to great\".Great companies place more emphasis on character than on skills, education, special knowledge or work experience. Skills can be taught.Great companies are tough places to work. Great companies are rigorous, but not ruthless. Managers and employees are held to high standards. Standards are ferocious and consistent. Great companies seldom have cost cutting layoffs, but underperformers are fired.Practical disciplines for being rigorous rather than ruthless:1. When in doubt, don't hire - keep looking. Place tremendous emphasis on finding the right people.2. When you know you need to make a people change, act instead of delay. If you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake. Do not hire a lot of people and keep the best.3. Put your best people on the best opportunities and not the biggest problems.Breakthrough results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated, one on top of another. Start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of the current situation. The right decisions often become self-evident. You absolutely cannot make good decisions without first confronting the brutal truth.Four principles of creating an atmosphere where the truth is heard:1. Lead with questions, not answers.2. Engage in dialog and debate, not coercion.3. Conduct autopsies without blame. With the right people it's not necessary to assign blame, but only to search for understanding and learning.4. Build red flag mechanisms.Organize the entire world into simple ideas. All the \"good to great\" companies had simple strategies. The simple strategy guided all their actions.The simple strategic concepts come from three ideas:1. Discover what the company can be best in the world at. Focus on this world-class strength.2. Use insight into what drives your economic engine. Determine what single thing dominates profit and cash flow.3. Decide what you are deeply passionate about.Just because you have done something for a long time doesn't mean you can be best in the world.A culture of discipline1. Build a culture of freedom and responsibility within a framework.2. Fill the culture with self disciplined people willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibility.3. Don't confuse discipline with being a tyrannical disciplinarian.4. Exercise focus.Freedom and responsibility together allow management to manage the system and not the people. People in great companies go to great extremes to fulfill their responsibilities, bordering on fanaticism. Interview and secondary sources made continual use of words like disciplined, dogged, rigorous, determined, diligent, precise, fastidious, systematic, methodical, workmanlike, demanding, consistent, focused, accountable and responsible.The fact that something is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is irrelevant unless it fits into the corporate focus.On the use of technology, the author quotes Bertrand Russell: \"Men would rather die than think, many do.\" Technology, when used correctly, is an accelerator of momentum and not a creator of momentum.Personal reaction to \"Good to Great\"This entire study is just the sort of thing a statistician is trained and inclined to do. It was highly dependent on good experimental design, data collection and statistical technique.Most readers want to be level five leaders and will see some of the traits in themselves. Most readers will realize that they are not yet there.Jim Collins found quite a list of differences between his great companies and typical companies. In my opinion the most important difference is in leadership. The one most obvious difference between the two types of companies is the magnanimity of their leaders. Company executives usually rise within an organization by personal ambition. A level five leader makes the company great for the enhancement of the company, not for personal gain.This book forces the reader to confront realities. Some common uncomfortable realities are:- Most hiring policies will not get a company from good to great. Most hiring is based too much on skill and not enough on character. The level five leader needs to find people with the passion for the business.- Focus is crucial and every leader knows it. However, many of us still allow ouryselfs to take on projects for reasons that seem good at the time and bad later. I call these projects one-off projects. They always take on far more energy and resources (especially time) than expected at the start. One-off projects sometimes are good opportunities, but they always take too much time and delay more strategic projects.If a leader wants his/her company to go from good to great, the process will start with him/her.See:Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don'tGood to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to GreatBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies I had to review this book for a library management class and really enjoyed it. Collins combines your typical easy-to-read how-to management book with a scientific study of companies that made a drastic shift from average to stellar. While I'm not sure that his results are as clear cut as he does, he clearly explains why his research group came to the conclusions they did, so you can decide for yourself. And even though I'm not sure that his ideas are 100% water-tight, I still think they're more than just a step in the right direction. The book is also full of great examples from the companies he studied. If nothing else this is an excellently written group of case studies.As a non-business person, I still found the principles easily applicable to my situation, especially since one of his major findings was that the great companies weren't after profit for the sake of profit alone, but as a result of being excellent at their company's core mission. But if you'd like to see a closer correlation to the non-profit sector, you can read his brief follow-up: Good to Great and the Social Sectors. This book is very analytical and is especially good for folks who love to review data. Bottom line, there are several incredibly important items that are consistent among companies who have demonstrated market growth/dominance for a long period of time. This book shares with you, what those themes are. If you are interested in improving your business, read this book and apply the principles today! This is a fantastic book that gives you ideas on becoming a better person or organization. Great read! I agree with the last reviewer (copykat). I too question the validity of discussing past practices rather than current trends. What Jim Collins describes is the softer side of business leadership, but gives me no advice on how companies can put new business processes into practice. Remember Hammer and Champy's Reengineering the Corporation from the 90s, well I've just read CSC's new one, Business Process Management The Third Wave. Way cool. My advice - read Jim Collins to find out what to do, read bpm3.com to find out how to do it. What? Ethics and business? Yes!What Jim Collins has done fits squarely in the Aristotelian model of ethical discourse. Despite his misgivings about Philip Morris and the issue of smoking (he's a health nut), the great companies he describes are models of flourishing human communities with clear standards of behavior and honesty. One could even say that the people in great companies love their companies and their coworkers in those companies. His methodology reminds us of the loss we suffered when Aristotle's collection of constitutions went missing. For serious readers, a comparison with Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue and Whose Justice, Which Rationality would be most rewarding. Both authors are on to something regarding traditions, practices, critical thinking, and the goods to be achieved in flourishing communities. There are lessons in this book for those who believe that good management and good ethics are somehow different. The moral value of Level Five leaders begs for wider consideration. Marrying ethics to success in business would really be revolutionary! I really love that Jim Collins explores essential aspects of growth and does it with a talented team - OVER TIME!!!The framework Collins and his team use to share the results of their research is masterful! The book is divided into three Discipled People, Disciplined Thought, Disciplined Action... and really, isn't this at the heart of success? Beautiful, thoughful and fundamentally a wonderful contribution to those of us who love and are intrigued by organizational leadership, beahaviour and results.In the winter of 2004, Good to Great provided our leadership team at Tomoye Corp., with some excellent content to shape a collective inquiry. Our team focused rather extensively on the Hedgehog Concept which centres around three central questions:1)What are you deeply passionate about?2)What you CAN be the best in the world at?3)What drives your economic engine?As you can imagine, these questions are essential to developing a clear and compelling organizational identity. Our exploration of these questions was powerful - and would likely have been even more productive if the questions became integrated into our ongoing leadership team work and agenda. After all, these questions typically form the basis of what magnetizes others or repels them.The content available on the Good to Great website is pretty hot: http://www.goodtogreat.com/ A very well organized discussion. Lends good insight into how some companies could use some really simple principles to steer clear of mediocrity & rose a great deal...Simple principles - as it turns out - arent all that simple to put to practice. And that is what causes some good companies to remain good forever - while others rise.Quite many reviewers have harped on the fact that most of the companies studied to have risen to great levels have - since then - not been all that great. well, i dont think that is a problem with this book. It could be argued both ways - probably those companies lost it and werent applying these principles as well..in any case, this book is not meant to be the God written will that these companies will always be great.Just that they used these principles & -in that phase- did rise to great levels. period. So, you could apply/adapt these principles & potentially benefit as well. Simple. Again Collins writes a must read book. Again, (though this book doesn't deal with churches or religion) the applications to the church are obvious and powerful. As a pastor, concerned about the need for the church to regain its focus on reaching people with the life transforming love of Jesus, I found this book sets forth a strategy that would help any organization (in my interest, a church) be more healthy, focused and productive.Collins findings regarding Level 5 Leadership is a needed antidote to the \"Corporate\" style many pastors have sought to emulate. Getting the right people on the bus in the right roles, doing the hard work of assessing the brutal facts, taking the time to find the hedgehog concept, and then developing a disciplined culture are all correctives to much of what needs to be changed in an ineffective church.Lest the reader of this review think I am suggesting the church take a page from the corporate world, let me assure you that Collins has written about foundational qualities that you might conclude reflect eternal values. Maybe that's why they became great companies! My PR firm is small but this book did a heck of a job teaching me how I can use Fortune 500 company strategies for growth and excellence.Robert SmithPR Doctor3pr@ureach.com Every leader, board member, c suite exec and mba student should read this book and prescribed to its foundations. Classic perspectives on what keeps good companies from their demise by bringing in the outside leadership teams. Combine this with &#34;the leadership engine&#34; and you have the perfect formula for long-term success. This book is a very detailed study, with useful data, which one expects from a large group research project with many graduate students. However, the basis on which the study was founded runs counter to a basic principle of Finance theory - their assumption that an increased stock price reflects an improved company.Basic finance theory is that the expected future performance of a company is already accounted for in the current price. See \"efficient markets\" for more info. The question that bases the research should not have been \"why did these companies improve?\", but rather \"why did these companies perform better than analysts had predicted?\". The latter question means that a company could have gotten worse, but less worse than analysts predicted, so the stock price increased. Or on the flip side, a company could have greatly improved, but still less than analyst predicted, so the stock price dropped.Rephrasing the later question - \"why did professional analysts underpredict the performance of these companies over the given time frames?\". Anyone who has spent time on the shop floor and with customers - i.e. the engineers, technicians, salesmen, and support people who keep the world humming can answer that in most cases. The analysts sitting in NYC reading financial statements haven't a clue. In most examples in the book, the company had spent much time developing a product or system and was ready to stamp out the design. The development costs were \"water under the bridge\" at that point. Think of Nucor who developed the mini-mills they could stamp out across the country, similar to the Big Box mini-malls you see everywhere. The analysts didn't know and couldn't have appreciated the design and organizational effort it took to get to the that level, and thus under-priced the stock. Most of the other company examples in the book are similar.I do believe the book reaches the correct basic conclusion - that flashy and clueless CEO's bring negative value and most improving companies are run by hard working individuals of small ego who worked their way up by extreme dedication to the company. The analysts didn't price that value correctly either. I believe it to be good for the following reasons:It is easy to readTo the pointHas plenty of examples, graphs, etcI could not put it downI think it is a great book for anyone interested in what makes other companies tick, and how they go about doing business and especially the impact people have on the long run. I would describe it as a well done comparative, rational and step by step analysis, with useful summaries at the end of each chapter. In addition there are plenty of insightful quotes from people.It is a nice tool for reflection too for anyone involved in a managerial position of some relevance, be it in a large corporation or a family business like it is my case. To call Good to Great merely a business book might actually do it a disservice, because like any outstanding creative work, it not only speaks to its subject and its time, but transcends those to address bigger truths about human nature. I hope to some day start my own business (which is when I will be sure to review the many valuable insights), but even if that never comes to pass, I will still consider it time well spent.From a rational standpoint it's reassuring to read about the rigorous methodologies and reams of data the author and his team went through, but from my perspective the really interesting part was the lessons they synthesized from these great leaders, and the nicely-phrased comments Collins often makes to sum up said lessons. For example, \"expending energy to motivate people is largely a waste of time . . . if you have the right people on the bus, they will be self-motivated.\" On this and countless other observations I found myself thinking Yes, this is how people are, and this is how they work.I couldn't recommend it more highly. Here's the thing about Good to Great: it's a well-written study that belies its underlying flaw - that it's a very tiny study. That is to say the entire set of core principles upon which the book is founded derives from just 11 companies. Now there are some great learnings from the leaders of those companies, don't get me wrong, but I'm not willing to stake my entire paradigm perception of good business models on such a small and dated study (it is now over half a decade old). For a much better look into successful managers and their behavior patterns, see Buckingham's \"First Break All the Rules\", which was a Gallup study of over 10,000 managers. Three stars: five stars for excellent research and writing, minus two stars for impact and size of study (and subsequent relevence). This book was recommended by some friends. I began it with an open mind, believing that perhaps Collins had performed a true scientific, or at least logical, study. However, I soon found that the \"study\" he conducted held little weight. Collins and his people essentially conducted a \"look back\" study. It is the type of study that produces results of no use. These types of studies are discounted continuously in the scientific community. It would be similar to me comprising years of NFL data and finding that teams with blue in their uniforms and QBs named Bob win 60% more games that teams with red uniforms and QBs named Hank. It doesn't mean anything. If all of the CEOs of the \"great\" companies had mustaches, would Collins suggest that this was a key element as well. The only true study that could be conducted would be for Collins to set up two companies: one with all of the characteristics of a \"great\" company that he has \"discovered\" and one without. If the former company succeeds and the later fails and all else is equal, then I'll listen. To perform an experiment like that and keep everything else equal is nearly as impossible as putting what it takes a good company to become great in 250+ pages. Bad try! An energizing book for both managers and students. No academic bla bla.., but a practical book. For some an eye opener for others a feast of recognition. For all in business a must. Good to Great presents some novel theories on business management that go against many commonly held beliefs. For example, it supports the theory that humble, subdued executives are required for sustained growth while superstar executives hurt rather than help a company's chance for greatness. However, the study in the book fails to prove that the factors for success apply to all organizations, as it claims. In fact, the study falls short in three areas: 1) its empirical evidence shows high correlation between the factors and greatness, but it is incapable of showing causation. 2) The study claims that all seven listed success factors are necessary for a transition to greatness, but it does not show that the seven factors are sufficient. The Experiment, where researchers would iteratively guess at a theory and then test it leaves a lot of room for missing an important and required success factor. 3) The study never proves applicability to organizations outside the list of 28 studied companies during the studied time period (from about 1970 to 2000). [...]I created the site above for a graduate-level school project. The website has no commercial interest. After reading this book I was not very impressed. Jim Collins started with a template and tried to find companies that would fit into his template. His leadership idea is nothing new and he could have taken all the leaders in the world and found stories that fit into his mold. His revelations are obnoxious and he spends about half the book talking about the good to great concept instead of using deep analysis to uncover some hidden truths.One of the greatest flaws of this book is how he took a good look at certain companies through interviews but he failed to study any of the accounting changes that effected some of the businesses he discusses. One of the most notable is Walgreen's and circuit city who were able to structure their leases in such a way that they did not have to disclose them on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. Walgreens and Circuit City grew because their bankers didn't get the full picture of how much debt the company was able to take on under the table and not disclose. Now that these companies are forced to disclose that information they appear less solvent and their stock price has adjusted to reality. Additionally Circuit City tanked when the new accounting practices and bad economy showed how insolvent they really were.Other things Jim Collins failed to mention involved the establishment of right to work states that ended union control on companies and allowed NUCOR to establish one of the most efficient manufactures in the world.Most of the companies Jim talks about have fallen apart in heaps and are bad to average. He should have written a book about how little research he had to do to write a book that would get praise from the entire academic sector but be a complete bad to worse book at best.Don't buy the book! Save your money and take some accounting classes and you can then uncover what takes a company from good to great! My company name is 'Hedgehog Solutions', this shows the belief we have in this book. The heart of my consulting revolves around moving individuals and companies from mediocrity to excellence so I knew I was right at home when Collins started out his book with a chapter called \"Good is the Enemy of Great\". It ends up that this book not only enhanced how I look at businesses, but also enriched our family.This book has become part of our family culture, including having been read by our business-minded 12-year-old. We see him look around our world and make observations about \"getting the right people on the bus\" (highlighting the importance of getting the right people as part of the team before determining where you're going) or the \"hedgehog concept\" (the place of simplicity and overlap between your passion, what you can be the best in the world at, and make money doing). It has given us a common language upon which to discuss our observations about what companies are doing that likely will contribute to their success or failure.Even if you are not in the business world, many of the applications apply to other groups like sports teams or even families. As parents, we try to exercise Level 5 Leadership, focusing on the larger goal of building a great family over feeding our own ego needs. We teach that a Culture of Discipline relieves us from being rule enforcers and best supports every individual in our family to become their best. These concepts have enriched our family (and are an easier sell when it comes from Collins and is based on extensive research than if our kids think we just made this stuff up!)This book is a must read for any company, organization or team leader who is committed to taking their team to a level of excellence. If this book is not in your library, you need to add a copy soon.Mollie Marti, Ph.D., J.D.Author, Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success This item arrived in excellent shape and on time for my leadership classwork.Thanks My product came very quickly and in great shape! I couldn't be happier with the buying experience and the product I received. This book came highly recommended by my mother, who has no experience in corporate America and only limited interest in what makes corporates great. The main appeal was the lesson's applicability to personal life achievement. I find that she was right, and I do work for a corporation! Reading this book as taught me important lessons for what to look for in a company, and for what types of universal truths apply to making a person (not just a company) move from the comfort of mediocrity to true greatness. By the way, I was a little leery when I first started reading it, that it would be dry and full of numbers like earnings reports and ROI, etc. To my surprise and pleasure, the book reads much easier then I thought and it's been very enjoyable. I can highly recommend this book. The modern classic business culture book. Many of the author's findings are now considered conventional wisdom, but his insights are derived from good fundamental research and analysis of a variety of companies.While at first it seems like a \"wishy washy\" new age self help book, it quickly turns to real examples, real solutions, real prescriptions on how operational decisions can be made to avoid the systemic failures he describes in his negative examples (e.g. confront brutal facts, don't be an ostrich).This book is tightly focused on case studies of organizations and management teams which found a way to take \"it\" to the next level or found a way to reverse a declining tack. The ideas focus on getting the right people in the right positions, ways to organize and crystallize ideas/identify problems, and how to take action with that team and solutions.Some of the concepts mirror other technical disciplines (the \"lifecycle\" and iteration in project management leaps to mind in the author's \"flywheel\" concept), but all of the ideas mirror the central theme - how to use the lessons of the example companies to better organize your own team, organization, company, even country.What makes a \"great\" company - How can your organization be changed to \"hit on all cylinders?\" - The book is effective in its presentation of the answers to those questions, citing real world examples and statistics. But of course, the hard part is actually doing it - the book is a tool, a set of guiding principles and exercises that, with a little serendipity, one can use as input to make positive changes in one's own organization. If you liked Jim Collins' book, \"Built to Last\", you will love his follow up called, \"Good to Great\". This is one of those rare cases, where the sequel is actually better than the original.While developing his theory of what makes companies great Collins and his team of researchers reviewed thousands of books, articles, and annual reports; conducted financial analyses on business records. They also interviewed senior executives and board members, scrutinized the personal and professional records of the CEO's. The research team essentially studied every aspect of the business that could be quantified, codified, analyzed, or compared.Collins and his team make some very astute conclusions regarding a business great. These conclusions include moving from good to great starts with leadership, with the will and drive to succeed the leader guides the company's success. Greatness depends on finding the right people to manage and run the business. The company must look at the facts objectively and confront the brutal facts. Great companies discover what they are best at or what they can be the best at and focus all their energy on those activities. Finally the company has to develop a culture of discipline to remain focused on doing things that support success.I enjoyed this book because it is well written. Collins is able to takes some very complex ideas and explain them in easy to understand terms. All of the conclusions that Collins makes in regards to great companies are supported by research and are intuitively attractive.The one conclusion that Collins makes that is not supports by any research is that his ideas can be applied to any organization. While this is a seductive proposition it has no basis in research. When Collins and his team selected the companies they determined as great is was based on these companies stock performance in relationship to comparison companies. By Collins definition of a great company it must be publicly traded. To think that all of these concepts can be applied to schools or faith-based organizations may be stretching their usefulness. I like the way 'Good to Great' outlines many corporate leadership attributes, especially discipline, which is rare these days. I can honestly say Mr Collins' book is helping my company go from OK-ordinary-good to great, as shown by our bottom line. Lately, I picked up the book by Norman Thomas Remick, '..Going Beyond Leadership of Character..', and I can honestly say it is already helping me, personally, to grow as a leader, and is the 'Good to Great' counterpart dealing, not with taking a business or corporation from OK-ordinary-good to great, but taking an individual from good to great in leadership. The Collins book is obviously the gold standard for companies, the Remick book is the new guy on the block for ambitious leaders of character. Everyone is aiming for integrity these days. The problem is that nobody really knows what the definition is! Well, I can tell you that if you are trying to create a trustworthy and reputable business, you need to be following the studies in this book to the \"t.\"Here are some various notes that I've taken from it's pages:-An egotistical leader can build a company quickly but it will lead to mediocrity in the end. This is because egotistical people only care about the personal reward and not how their actions contribute to others.-The best leaders are WILLING and not bashful to fire their family members, because they only want the people that will be the best for the company.-The essential strategy in maintaining a great company is like being a bus driver. You must know how to select the best people and get them on the bus, but also how to get the wrong people off of the bus and replace them with someone who is a performer. People who are not right for the company are a sickness that will infect the top performers and restrict their growth. If everyone on the bus is absolutely right for the company and believes in what they are doing then the company will soar.-Short term thinking: having top performing employees taking slack of poor employees. Long term thinking: firing poor employees and replacing them with new and better performers. This saves money and allows more production and won't cause your top performers to get fatigued so they can blossom.-Good is the nemesis of Great. You should never settle for mediocrity or else the company will never be competitive and will fail to keep up with growing demands and trends. Mediocrity causes people to become lazy and to stop trying and forget what got them success in the first place. When they become complacent they will fail.-Great companies always hire outstanding people and will create positions around them. This is how they prepare for the future.-BAD companies live by the theory that key people should never hire anyone smarter than them because they want to remain secure in their position. The best companies hire the smartest and best and work together to build something great. They recognize that if they hire mediocre employees then the competition will beat their company anyway and their company will fail and they will be out of a job, so why not work with the best people and have the best company that causes other companies to fail? It is the difference between short term and long term thinking.-Hard workers don't stay with your company because of the money: they stay because they cannot settle for less. If you expect the best and set the standard of quality high for the company and the people working there, the best employees will want to work their instead, because of the experience working with the best people and also knowing that they are creating something that they can be proud of. I am sure the best companies still pay their employees well, but this argument is saying that the company doesn't have to worry about the employee leaving just because they got a higher offer at another company. This is how Zappos became great (If you read \"Delivering Happiness\" by Tony Hsieh): they actually offered to pay people to leave their company if they were considering joining another company that would pay more. NOW THAT is how you know you have the right people on your team: because they can see the potential in your brand rather than the temporary dollar signs.-\"When in doubt, don't hire--keep looking\"-Never quit serving top quality, or customers will start noticing and then lose trust in your company. If you start \"watering-down\" your product in order to earn more revenue, you are are short-term thinker and will lose more in the long run.-Walgreens became one of the top USA companies solely because they used a model of creating tight clusters and building a branch close to another one. This is obvious with other franchises such as McDonald's: Even though I personally think that it is annoying to have the same store a few blocks away, the results are staggering.-The best teams are those where the members hold themselves accountable. If you have the best people, they won't settle for a poor performer to do shoddy work. The team polices itself and doesn't wait for a manager to intervene. They create their own punishment and expect the best from each other. They understand that the team is only as strong as its weakest member.I have had the line stick with me forever when Jim Collins' wife said that if she quit her job and dedicated herself fully to competing in triathlons that she would be the best in the world. He then goes on to say that if you are going to do anything then you might as well make sure that you are going to be the best at it--if not, then what is the point in trying and failing? This is a different take on the common phrase: \"Go big or go home\" but makes the statement a lot more concrete with a real-world example.I am not sure why I decided to read this book at the young age of 23. I knew that it would be a good book from the review online, but I didn't know that it would be so LIFE CHANGING and relate to me as a person and not just basic corporate mumbo-jumbo. I have yet to open my own business but this book is the main reason why I think that owning a business is the only way to go in America. I am proud that teachings such as this exist and I am grateful for Jim Collins in providing readers with such powerful and inspirational material. Well done!-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games love the books on cd and this one is well read and easy to follow/understand for the long drives into work. Gotta love multi-tasking. excellent! can't say enough \"great\" things about this book. have lent it out to my colleagues who are enjoying it immensely! This management book has proven to be a hit among business professionals. It is easy to read, and covers a lot of material between its covers. The message I got from it is that to strategize is good. And if you fine tune your strategy enough you might grow your company from being merely good to becoming great.I would have liked the book better if it pointed out that many people try to fine-tune their businesses, but fail at creating great companies. Luck is an element of business that probably deserved its own chapter in this book. Unfortunately it was left out.Also, keep in mind that no company stays great. What goes up must eventually come down. This book is about striving to get the company to go up. 4 stars! WHOOPS. Check out this quote from the book: \"Fannie Mae grasped the subtle denominator of profit per mortgage *risk level*, not per mortgage (which would be the \"obvious\" choice). It's a brilliant insight. The real driver in Fannie Mae's economics is the ability to understand risk of default in a package of mortgages better than anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing the spread on that risk. Simple, insightful, unobvious--and right.\"Oh except that it wasn't right. It was dead wrong. Fannie's \"brilliant insight\" represents the rampant irresponsibility that caused the financial crisis and literally broke the entire economy.So much for \"good\" to \"great\". How can you believe a book whose analysis was so apocalyptically wrong. Common sense approaches to thinking about businesses. Collins takes a very defined and clinical approach to his evaluations. Worth a read. This is a must read for any MBA student. The detailed analysis and approach to the problem in it's own is reason to read this book. The findings are interesting but not really stunning, it really doesn't take a genious to understand what makes certain companies stand out. Furthermore, the fact that some of the companies have taken such a downward spiral to bancruptcy makes it hard to see that good to geat is anything more than a temporary setting. Of course Collins makes an excellent point to talk about this in the audio book and because he reads it himself, I advise listening to the audio book over reading the hardback. His stress on certain words and interludes give the audio book listener a different perspective of that of the reader. Jim Collins, author of the seminal classic Built to Last, addresses a dilemma many entrepreneurs face. Can a good (read: average) company evolve into a great one, effectively re-jiggering the culture and direction of a company once set? In a well-researched tome that is both easy to read (I finished it in three days) and clearly/compellingly articulated, Collins concludes that average companies can indeed morph into great ones. Providing excellent guidance for decision-making on new and existing ventures, he bucket-izes the structure of his conclusions under the aegis of disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action. Among the conclusions about Good to Great companies:1. Their leaders are less differentiated by charisma or brilliant vision and more by humility and unrelenting will.2. Their focus is first on WHO (i.e., getting the right people through the door and in the right position, and the wrong people out door), then WHAT (i.e., figuring out and building the strategy)-- not the other way around.3. They confront the brutal facts and deal with them directly and decisively by \"shining a light\" on the key issues impacting the business and taking a \"need to know\" perspective at all times to reality as it really exists. At the same time, this pragmatism is counterbalanced by an unrelenting guttural belief that they will prevail in the end (called the Stockdale Paradox).4. They build their strategy around three core circles (target markets they realistically believe they can dominate, ones with compelling economics, and ones they can be truly passionate about), and then come up with a crystallizing concept (called the Hedgehog) that flows from a deep understanding of the dynamics of the three circles.5. The hedgehog concept's power is less a function of one big transformation and more a product of many incremental improvements, culminating in the breakout success (debunking the myth of the overnight success). Ironically, to those inside the company the magnitude of the transformation is often unclear at the time.6. They depend on building a culture of self-disciplined team members around the three circles (disciplined people, practicing disciplined thought and translating that into disciplined action) to the point of avoiding any \"once in a lifetime opportunities\" that fall outside the hedgehog concept. Also, as a result, they are able to avoid bureaucratic corporate structures.7. They embrace new technologies solely as accelerators of the three circles and not creators of them, and avoid investments that don't specifically feed the three circles.8. There are no inconsistencies with reconciling short-term financial performance pressures and maintaining long-term adherence to working the flywheel of the hedgehog concept to create a virtuous cycle of growth and sustenance. In short, these companies embrace the paradox that managing for both short-term and long-term success simultaneously is challenging but part of the \"problem\" being solved by the business.Good to Great is a must read for people committed to building and/or investing in great businesses, as well as those personally driven to become great at what they do professionally. The book is great and provides rational insights into how business can be successful. Very factual based and well researched. It is an extremely interesting read. It has many pearls of information, but no diamonds. For diamonds, look at the strategy and tactics of pricing. Some reviews say that the book does not apply to all organizations b/c of the type of companies selected for the study (e.g. public vs privately owned). However, readers should not get hung up on minutae but look a the larger concepts imparted by this book. I view it as a good general blueprint for willing a company toward success. For those business people with aims to join the executive ranks (or for those already there) this book is as necessary as any other book on management. An advantage Good to Great possesses is that it goes about its inquiry in - for the most part - a structured way, attempting to prove or disprove assumptions we have about what great management is. I have read few things that have stuck with me so long as Jim Collin's Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is a central theme in understanding what can propel a company from good to great. It also highlights the importance of knowing your business and your customer, rather than flailing about trying to 'reinvent' every time there is a shift in the market or a dip in profitability, which is excellent advice for business leaders operating within our current economy.This book provides insights to leadership, change, and a broad view across industries and traits and behaviors that successful companies and their leadership share in common. Lots of wisdom here on how to lead, not be distracted by ego, and to identify your company's Hedgehog Concept. I read this book with great interest as it's selection criteria for the finally selected 11 companies was strict and the author does not withold any information on the selection process either. The end of the book lists its selection criteria, complete with a comprehensive FAQ section.The final selection consists of 11 good to great companies (Selected from 1435 Fortune 500 companies) and 17 comparison companies that could not qualify. The primary selection process consisted of baselining the 'good to great' companies at three times the market for fifteen years including 15 years of good performance (1.25 time the general stock market) preceding the transition while the company had to be an established, on going company, not a startup.Pretty strict criteria that has led to some eye opening findings. Most of the findings can be browsed by reading the reviews on the Amazon .co.uk and .com sites.A MUST READ BOOK for all aspiring and current leaders of companies. This book has a lot of conservative religious bigotry and cult-like zeal in it. Not to mention, it is full of drama, evangelized stories : \"16 years of struggle, Mockler crumpled to the floor, struck dead by a massive heart attack\". Maybe the author should have put yet more drama and said: a tsunami came and Mockler was carried through it in the shadow of holy spirit.We must build a society of tolerance and respect for all, not preach such masked hate ideologies as delivered discreetly in the book all over. After reading this book I feel like it important to address why some people give it 1 out of five stars. I do not think Jim Collins meant to invent any new and crazy ideas with this book rather than shedding light on what we already know but somehow forget to implement in our daily business lives. I find it fascinating that Circuit City and Fannie Mae were once great companies and believe that their failure only strengthens Jim Collin's thesis. Just because a business was great last year doesn't mean it will continue to be great. Great business practices require constant attention and I feel that this book's principles makes it clear why those businesses failed in the end even though at the time of publication they were at the top of their game. All in all, I think the book is well written, a quick read, slightly overpriced, and completely worth your time. Go to the library, pick it up, read it over a week or weekend, and put all the concepts in the back of your head because the worst thing that can happen to you is a paper cut when you turn one of the pages. Book arrived as almost what I would expect from a NEW purchase. Arrival was right on time -- couldn't have asked for a better experience. Will continue to buy used books confidently thru Amazon. In his latest book, Jim Collins, coauthor of &quot;Built ToLast&quot;, explores the secrets behind consistentlysuccessful companies he terms \"great.\" To beclassified as \"great,\" the company needs to have madethe leap from average to great results and sustainedit for at least fifteen years. Surprisingly fewcompanies meet this criteria. Collins worked with aresearch team to study and discover what commonmanagement elements long-term great companies share.This book presents the results of this study and somestartling findings.The first common element among the great companies isthat the CEO is a low-profile, no-nonsense individualand he/she creates an environment of teamwork.Supporting this approach is the standard of havingcapable, motivated staff in every position in thecompany. Collins terms this, &quot;having the right peopleon the bus and in the right seats.&quot; He noted thesuccessful CEO's made crucial changes to their staffsas soon as they attained their positions. Only highlymotivated and capable individuals were on their team.Once this foundation was in place, the teams metconsistently to contemplate just three criteria thatwould drive the company. Collins terms this simplestrategy, &quot;The Hedgehog Concept.&quot; The criteria are:the company focuses on a goal in which they could benumber one in the industry, the goal is somethingabout which the team feels passionate, and the goalis clear and concise. In each case study presented,this focus brought about amazing clarity on theoperation of the business, directly leading tosuccess.Collins' study specifically started with companiesthat were just average before making the leap togreat. However, the principles can be applied tomultiple situations. Whether you are an entrepreneuror working within a corporate structure, this bookprovides insight in how to better reach your goals. I thought this would be a good book, but a boring one. I was totally wrong. It has ideas that i think everyone has wanted to yell out at some point while at work, and backs them up with solid research. Why settle for \"good enough\" if there is a potential to be \"great\"? I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Jim Collins because it clearly states a research objective, shows how the data was gathered and draws thoughtful conclusions. But, Good To Great ultimately challenges you -- the reader -- to draw conclusions of your own based on the overall information.I especially enjoyed the \"First Who, Then What\" concept where companies are encouraged to \"Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.\" As a business owner, this book challenged me to look back over my own career.By JoAnna Carey, Author of Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life Although I'm just in the first few chapters of this book, I've found it very useful. Mr. Collins and his teams have a very interesting approach to what makes a good and a great company. I've seen so many big companies that at the most can be considered good (although I wouldn't mind calling them mediocre - even though I'm talking of companies that every year makes millions of dollars). This Big company generally are satisfied by making good profits and boy are they good. But they're not great, not as good they could be. This book is a definitely eye opener, and every CEO and all top management should grab a copy, Gets at the real reasons why companies make it. Lessons galore for those who want to see their own organizations thrive. Book presents thought provoking strategies for making the leap. Proves that it is possible to guide good companies to great companies. Easy, clear writing. This is an excellent book and also it is a great option for everybody to read and understand the different between good and great companies and how a mediocre company can be transformed to a great company. Years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, \"Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?\" He concludes that it is possible, but not easy to do the transformation. At the beginning of the book appears this statement \"Good is the enemy of Great\" I totally agree with that, this book is intended to understand how a good company can be an excellent company. Collins and his team explore what goes into a company's transformation from mediocre to excellent. Based on empirical evidence and volumes of data, the team uncovers timeless principles on how the Good to Great companies produced sustained great results and achieved enduring greatness, evolving into companies that were indeed Built to Last.Collins and his team of researchers began their research by electing 1,435 companies, looking for companies that made great improvements in their performance. Finally, they elected only 11 great companies and they found that those have common patterns to be success. He and his research team interviewed most of the good to great executives. This book analyzes the practices that 11 companies made transition from good to excellent performance. Collins focused his research in very well-known companies, this issue makes the book interesting and the fact that technology did not in itself generate corporate transformation; and the scant attention that these upward-trending companies paid to such issues as managing change or motivating people. This book shows a new concept to me \"Level 5 Leadership\"; the term level 5 refers to the highest level in hierarchy of executive capabilities. It is surprised that a type of leadership is required for turning a good company into a great one. The good to great leaders are self-effacing, quiet, reserved, and even shy. The level five builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional. This concept is empirical and not an ideological one. This equations summarize the level five leadership personality (Humility +will= Level five) You have probably heard about Jim Collins book From Good to Great.After 5 years of research he and his team found truths about running a business that changed the way companies are built all over the world.I am very disappointed that I just read this book, I wish I have read it years ago.The lessons I learned where extremely valuable and not just when running a business. Just like Jim Collins says himself, the rules they found go for all development, he just uses organizations to illustrate it.First who then whatThis concept is very interesting in my eyes. It was one of the first things the team found. When making a change in a company you shouldn't start with a grand plan and vision. You start with finding the right people and getting them onto the buss and get the wrong people off.This works well in personal development as well. Before you start your journey, work on yourself. Improve your abilities, define yourself as a person and then open up and start on your path to success.Confront the brutal factsMost people and companies refuse to see truths that don't fit within their beliefs. They just find statistics and truths that confirm what they believe, instead of looking for the facts that contradict.If you are to succeed you need to know exactly what the truth is and act accordingly.Hedge Hog ConceptThis has made a big difference in my life.The hedge hog concept describes how you can find exactly what you should do and what a company should work with. It generates a simple answer, which takes about 4 years to find.The intersection of the three circlesYour passionWhat you can be the best in the world atYour economic denominatorWhen you find something that fits into all three, you have your hedge hog concept.This has helped me define my personal mission and build on what I know and can do. It has helped me take enormous strides towards my success.Do you work as a Manager, CEO or need to define your own personal mission this book is for youIf you want to learn more about how to run a business, what personality traits you need, how to build a team, how to define your mission and how to create a culture of discipline, you should definitely read this book.I have just scraped the surface on the advice given in this book and on reading Jim Collins other bookBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesvery soon. I guess I'm probably not the typical Jim Collins fan. I am not a business executive, but a small groups pastor in a large church in Louisville, KY (although I do have my BBA in Finance ... 10 years before I went into ministry). But I have found Good to Great extremely insightful and easy to implement into my leadership.I believe that every church leader and para-church leader should read this book. Yes, you will need to adapt much of this to make these business leadership principles work in your ministry (something we should always be seeking to do anyway, rather than simply adopting another program. See Scott Boren's book,The Relational Way: From Small Group Structures to Holistic Life Connectionsfor further discussion about this.).By the way, Collins wrote a companion book,Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great. I've read this one too, but found the original book to much more useful in my ministry leadership.Can church leaders learn from secular business writers? It's just my own opinion, but I believe we can ... and should. I believe that all truly good ideas emanate from one Ultimate Source, whether the writer knew or understood the Source or not. God the Creator uses a variety of resources to reveal Himself and teach us.I found Collins's ideas about a \"Level 5\" leader of particular interest for Christian leaders. I believe that the most complete Level 5 Leader--maybe the only perfect Level 5 Leader ever--is Jesus. (See my discussion about Jesus as \"the Best Leader Ever\" in my book,I'm a Leader...Now What?: How to Guide an Effective Small Group. I want to be a Level 5 Leader like the best leader ever!I have adapted and implemented something from every chapter of Good to Great. Recently as my team worked on a 3-year plan and key initiatives for this next year, we spent a lot of time confronting the brutal facts (chapter 4) and defining our hedgehog concept (chapter 5). I can't even begin to tell you how useful this was in planning for our ministry.Perhaps I resonate with this book more than the average church leader because of my background in business and my love for reading business leadership books and articles, but I believe church leaders can learn a lot from Good to Great regardless of their backgrounds. Imagine the potential kingdom impact if hundreds of local churches and ministries moved from merely \"good\" to \"great\"!___Reviewer: Michael C. Mack is a small groups pastor, founder of an online SmallGroups ministry, and author ofI'm a Leader...Now What?: How to Guide an Effective Small GroupandLeading from the Heart: A Cell Leader's Guide to Passionate Ministryamong others. One of the problems with most business books is that instead of dealing with a very real problem in very concrete terms and seeking out some very practicable answers, they tend to work along the edges, tackling small headaches that have fairly self-evident solutions which, because of their utter obviousness, don't need to be backed up with real hard data - because we've all experienced what the authors are telling us anyway.There are probably a lot of reasons for this - stupidity, laziness, the desire to create a book (as opposed to solve a real problem) - but let's be generous and say that the reason we don't see real concrete solutions to real problems is because real problems are hard to uncover, that real solutions are even harder to come by, and that real data about real problems and real solutions is harder still to generate and takes way too long anyway.So for those reasons alone, \"Good to Great\" by Jim Collins is worth buying, reading, (to read the rest of this review, please visit [...] A fun book for MBA students to trash. Give it to them seriously and see who is the first among them to figure out how ridiculous it is.Circuit City, built to last in search of excellence. This book is perfect for companies seeking to improve their overall position in an industry or for individual entrepreneursseeking to carve a successful niche in the target market. A strength of the work is that it explains thedistinguishing characteristics of great companies as opposedto good companies. In addition, the book provides the importantdistinguishing factors and lists recent research data to supportthe claims made . Presentation of the research data alone makesthe book a solid value for the price paid.The authors have taken numerous surveys and shaped a success model based upon the top performers across many industries.They've named Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillete and Nucor as top performers. The success models have many things in common. For instance, the employees value follow-through and a disciplined approach. People usually decide to stay or leavequickly. The leaders develop a vision and adhere to it feverishlyor enthusiastically. The managers are passionate about the product or vision, they are best at delivering the product or service and personal drive is high. Change is managed skillfully.This book is very helpful because the authors put together a model based upon successful companies and congruent behaviors that lead to successful outcomes. In addition, the authors deal with the question as to why some corporate strategies do not work. For instance, money alone is not always a cure-all for transitioning a company into the top-performer category. Lastly, the authors explain why successful companies get into the top performer status.The book is a solid value because the authors provide specific data to support the conclusions reached. This book is a solid value for the price paid. It is written well. Pie charts depict the various statistical data. The book is written for readers who can appreciate visual presentations of data. The data is important because it supports the conclusions reached for attaining successful corporate strategies on an ongoing basis. In today's world being \"good\" means multiplexing one's time between competing causes; only to creating the right balance leads to enduring \"greatness.\" I found Jim Collins' book to be a starting point for understanding and prioritizing those factors that may contribute to success. What I found most useful from this book were the stimulating ideas that served as the foundation for honest introspection. Here are some of the questions I asked myself after reading this book:What is your \"Hedgehog concept?\" Why do you spend time on anything but your Hedgehog concept?In what areas are you most undisciplined? Do you strictly adhere to the internal systems of your workplace? If not is this because you do not trust the systems, because the systems are too overburdening, because of laziness, because you never really questioned the usefulness of these systems, etc.?What percentage of time do you give to developing workplace relationships (the \"who\") vs. developing new ideas (the \"what\")? Is this a conscious balance or did it just happen this way? Is this the correct balance?Identify a time in which \"the brutal facts of reality\" may have challenged or shaken your long-term vision. How did you deal with this challenge? Did you respond by changing your near-term focus or your long-term goal? Was your reaction appropriate in retrospect?Are you driven by fear of competition or an intrinsic compulsion to create?I gave this book 4/5 stars because of its inconclusive and unenlightening description of the \"Level 5 Leader.\" I would be hard-pressed to describe the distinguishing qualities of a level 5-leader beyond modesty, ambition, and the willingness to pass on the torch. These qualities seemed to be quaint observances of chance qualities of the selected leaders of the 11 chosen companies. The book seemed to put forth the idea that these individuals did not really stand out from the crowd; this is good and fine, except that the reason I read that chapter in the first place was to determine what made those individuals stand out. How do these leaders stand apart from Level 4 (and below) leaders? What, exactly, is a Level 4 leader? The discussion was not enough to really serve as an introspective foundation for greatness. RECAPGood to Great, by Jim Collins, is based on 5 years of research that tries to explain \"why some companies make the leap...and others don't.\" The research involved selecting over 1400 companies that made the Fortune 500 from 1965 to 1995. Through a series of 5 cuts, the research team whittled the field down to 11 companies that were categorized as good to great along with a group of direct comparison companies. The book presents 5 key findings, including:* The presence of what Collins termed \"Level 5 Leaders\"* A deep understanding of purpose and simplicity termed the \"Hedgehog Concept\"* A culture of discipline* The role of technology as an accelerator* Consistent effort to produce results as opposed to big breakthroughs or radical changeLastly, Collins related the findings from the book to findings in his book, Built to Last, which was published a couple years later. Collins stated that findings from Good to Great enabled the ideas in Built to Last and pointed to a connection between BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) and the Hedgehog Concept. He stated that a BHAG is a key way to stimulate progress while preserving the core, which provides a unifying focal point of effort and framed by specific understandings. Essentially, a BHAG lies at the core of the 3 elements of the Hedgehog Concept.PROFESSIONAL VALUEIn terms of the value I would place on the findings from this book, I would say that there are definitely useful points. However, most of those key findings seem most applicable to CEOs and to a lesser extent CMOs. There should be collaboration between chief executives to strive for greatness, but by nature of hierarchies, a CMO would not be able to establish the elements necessary to help a company achieve greatness.WHY THIS BOOKI was aware of this book for some time, but never took the time to read it. I had heard that some of the concepts could be applied not only to business, but to life as well, so that aspect interested me.LESSONS LEARNEDThere were many take-aways from this book, some of which I have actually applied to my life. The lessons that I found the most value in, either professionally or personally, include:* The Stockdale Paradoxo Stoically accept the brutal facts of realityo \"You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.\" - Admiral Stockdale* The Hedgehog Concepto Business* What you are deeply passionate about* What you can be the best in the world at* What drives the economic engineo Personal* What are you passionate about?* What can you be the best in the world at?* Do you get paid well to do it?IMPLEMENTATIONImplementing the key findings in a business setting would require high-level authority. From a marketer's standpoint, I would take these ideas to my future cohorts and seek collaboration. Some of the principles seem like they can be learned, taught, and/or gained over time, such as finding a Hedgehog Concept. However, there are others, such as Level 5 Leadership, which may not occur due simply to character, personality, or desire. From experience in both entrepreneurial settings and Fortune 500 settings, it's my opinion that establishing some of the principles in a company culture from the beginning make the chances of success, for any specific principle, higher. If you like management this is the book to read. This book teaches you all the good practices to have a great company. Well, that's how the book opens. It is not an understatement. This book helps people at all levels understand what hard work needs to be accomplished in order to make the jump to Great. It can be done. What is required? Confront the brutal facts about needed changes: who should be on the bus and who should not be? Do we have a culture of discipline? What about the one thing we can truly be the best in the world at; are we doing that?This book is loaded with improvement opportunities for every company. It is an enjoyable read, Jim is an amazing author and speaker, and I have personally tried to apply suggestions made in the book.Oh, if you think you are a Level 5 leader, you probably are not! Jim Collins and his research team have done an extraordinary job! There is a reason why this book has sold way over two million copies and why it was named the #1 Bestseller.When I first purchased a copy of the book and flipped through the pages, I was a little overwhelmed with all the charts illustrated throughout the text. I thought to myself, \"oh no, it's going to be another book where I will be hugging the dictionary and scratching my head!\" However, it was nothing that I had predicted. It was so easy to read and comprehend as every chart and figure was carefully explained and simply exemplified.What I enjoyed most about reading the book was the fact that everything here is common sense, nothing is new. For example, we know that hiring the right people is essential in running a great company and being able to insert them into the right tasks (their strengths) will not only create a better working atmosphere and environment, but establishes a comfort zone and constructs a relationship between management and employee in regards to trust and understanding. Additionally, as in every company, the sooner the company is able to understand, accept, and confront their brutal facts (weaknesses), then the better and stronger the company can become. \"Good to great companies faced just as much adversity as the comparison companies, but responded to that adversity differently.\" Lastly, knowing and understanding what you are passionate about, what you can be the best in the world at, and getting paid to do just that will help push and drive yourself to become Great, as the motivation is there.This is all common sense knowledge, and a stroke of genius on how Jim Collins and his research team were able to validate and justify it. They have proven what we know is true and what we know should work with years of research through company comparisons and specific examples.Overall, this is definitely a book worth purchasing. It provides numerous examples of specific scenarios that reflect the concepts and theory related. And most notably, it is written so simply that a sixth grade student will be able to understand it. Dear Business Managers and CEOs:I am here to help you. You might not like what I say because most of you have never taken a proper course on how to do research and how to analyze the results of research.If you knew better, then you would not be buying this book. If you doubt what I am saying, pick up a copy of the following journal article: Selection Bias and the Perils of Benchmarking. By: Denrell, Jerker. Harvard Business Review, Apr2005, Vol. 83 Issue 4, pp. 114-119It starts off like this:MANAGERS LEARN BY EXAMPLE. They--and the consultants they pay for advice--study the methods and tactics of successful companies in search of the magic formulas for business prosperity. What could make more sense?What could be more dangerous. Looking at successful firms can be remarkably misleading. I once listened to a presentation about the attributes of top entrepreneurs. Drawing on a wealth of impressive case studies, the speaker concluded that all of these leaders shared two key traits, which accounted for their success: They persisted, often despite initial failures, and they were able to persuade others to join them.That sounded reasonable enough to most people in the audience. The only trouble was, the speaker failed to point out that these selfsame traits are necessarily the hallmark of spectacularly unsuccessful entrepreneurs. Think about it: Incurring large losses requires both persistence in the face of failure and the ability to persuade others to pour their money down the drain.Here's the problem about learning by good example: Anyone who tries to make generalizations about business success by studying existing companies or managers falls into the classic statistical trap of selection bias- that is, of relying on samples that are not representative of the whole population they're studying. So if business researchers study only successful companies, any relationships they infer between management practice and success will be necessarily misleading.The theoretically correct way to discover what makes a business successful is to look at both thriving and floundering companies. Then business researchers will correctly identify the qualities that separate the successes from the failures. Researchers might conclude- as many have--that the strength of a company's culture is associated with success because many successful companies have strong cultures. But if they were to study bankrupt companies as well, they might find that many of those also had strong cultures. They might then be moved to hypothesize that the nature of a company's culture is at least as important as its intensity and then look more deeply into the whole issue of culture.Similarly, if we want to examine effective leadership traits, we cannot look only at excellent managers. We must also consider managers who failed to be promoted, were demoted, or were fired. Perhaps their styles of leadership were equally visionary- or humble. Without looking, we cannot tell.Denrell continues . . .Cautionary words and counsels of failure, I know, are seldom well received. Managers crave certainties and role models from business literature, and to some extent they have to. They live in a fast-paced world, and they often cannot afford to postpone action until they get better data. But there really is no excuse for ignoring the glaring traps we've described in these pages. Success may be more inspirational, but the inescapable logic of statistics dictates that managers in pursuit of high performance are more likely to attain their goal if they give the stories of their competitors' failures as full a hearing as they currently do the stories of their successes.So, buy this book at your own risk. In fact, I hope you realize that it is better not to buy it. great book for a great price. Perfect for those studying buisness and such. Very informative and helpful. I would recommend this book from Amazon to my friends in school. I don't remeber myself reading so fundamental, capturing and so useful book ever. Every chapter contains great results. I tried to put down the main and the most interesting thoughts, but I must admit that the whole book is an outstarnding compilation of great quotes. No matter what you do, you must read it. This book broke some my paradigms.Enjoy it! I cannot believe anybody in their right mind is still buying this book. Collins' analysis was flawed from the outset when it was published in 2001 and 11 years later it has proven to be a failure. Four of his so called \"GREAT\" companies are Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal), Circuit City (declared bankruptcy), Wells Fargo ($25B bailout) and Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble). See a pattern? Great, huh?So much for Good to Great. Didn't anybody learn from his \"Built to Last\" book when most of the companies touted in that book did NOT last? Wake up people. Jim Collins' goal was to put YOUR money in HIS pocket. He feels GREAT about that.You better hope Jim Collins never puts a company you work for in one of his books. If he does, start looking for another job quick. Good to Government Cheese. Well, the jury is no longer out. What was thought to have worked 20 or 30 years ago may not be all it was cracked up to be. \"The bus\" analogy appears to have been a recipe for creating a completely narcissistic, homogenous company lacking the ability to see outside of their own contrived success. Can you say Logan's Run? Collins offers plenty of good advice however; I think we can all agree that the \"BEST\" people do not always create the best company. Simply throwing people off the bus is not necessarily change for the better. This is a book that will probably give readers a taste of what it's like to run a successful business, or at least what it's like to watch a successful business run. In this vein, it provides a handful of good concepts that will give entrepreneurs and executives pause before they sign on to the latest cliches of management. The concept of the fly-wheel (keep churning and it will get easier and more successful with each turn), the three aspects of a successful business idea, and the concept that good workers make the most significant difference in a company's success were the most valuable take-aways.I do have my criticisms. First, the methodology--the study was conducted very scientifically, but only on a portion of the companies. They used performance to identify their cases, then went backward to see what went right. Then they studied similar companies that didn't have the same success and went backward to see what went wrong. They did not investigate companies that did what the successful companies did and still failed, or companies that did not do what the case companies did and succeeded. Doing this would have made it a more comprehensive study.Second, the depth--the strength of this book is making powerful concepts accessible and memorable. \"Get the right people on the bus,\" \"Hedgehog concept,\" \"Wash your cottage cheese,\" etc. are all useful images that evoke what could be powerful management tools. The problem is that the author repeats these concepts ad nauseam and at the expense of real depth in the logic. As a result, the reader will remember the concepts, but might not be able to apply them in unique circumstances.It could be that I am looking for something that this book is not meant to provide, in which case I would love if someone could provide leads on books that cover the theory behind these concepts: Why is \"Who, then What\" successful? Why does modesty in leadership work over cockiness? How does bureaucracy form, how can it be diminished, and how does it affect workers and productivity?Third, the logic--It is possible that much of the logic is out there somewhere, and the lack of depth makes the arguments seem incongruent, but I could not agree with some of the book's central themes. For instance, \"Who, then What\" simply doesn't make sense. For instance, how do you get good people \"on the bus\" if they don't know or don't like where the bus is going?Fourth, the nits--I \"read\" the audio book version of this and was put off by the narrator's (the author's) style. He ended up putting exaggerated stress on pretty much everything he said, which means that nothing was highlighted and often most of the point was made ridiculous. It was like he was hammering a keyboard in order to make it register more than it would by just clicking the keys naturally.With that being said, the book is great inspiration for people who want to create greatness and use their business to do so. And anyone who has any recommendations for more theoretical-based surveys in this field, please comment this review--thanks! Jim Collins' study of business core values, principles and success concepts was expected to be timeless, even if the companies in the book were not. This is never more true than in the later half of 2008 where we see time after time companies missing the mark on these concepts and faltering badly.I suggest that Congress, the auto makers, unions and especially Wall Street read carefully, no study the concepts in Good to Great. Had Fannie Mae continued the principles it displayed in this study, the housing crisis could have had a leader in future prosperity rather than a goat in the middle of the mess.Take the time to study these principles of business carefully and not only follow them, live them. Jim Collins has created a book that is more than good to great, its Built to Last! Good to Great aspires you to not to settle for second best, and if you are then you need to examine why you are unless you are content with being so. Collins details how companies become \"great\" and how their comparisons fail to do so even though they face similar situations and circumstances. Collins makes it a point that great companies are not formed over night and in order to meet his stringent requirements only eleven companies can be classified as being truly \"Great.\" A refreshing discovery Collins and his research team discovered was the characteristics of what they consider a \"Level 5 Leader\" that took their companies and out performed good companies such as Coca-Cola and General Electric. Collins states the level 5 executives are humble, modest, works for the company and not themselves. They point any blame onto themselves when things do not go right, but contributes success to good luck and their team. Collins does a great job in comparing \"rival\" companies to the \"Great\" companies, investigates the differences between the two and explains how a company excels while the other one sinks. Good to Great is an easy read that keeps you interested and makes you \"re-think\" how companies are being run and managed, regardless of their size and industry they are in. Whether you own a business, are starting a business, or working for a business... this book is for you. :-) This book will help you with successes in your own personal life as well as business with it's easy to understand research on the timeless qualities of taking something good to something that will stand the test of time. Well researched and strong, sensible advise for people trying to lead. But, not as good as they thought at the time. Two of the good to great companies were Circuit City and Fannie Mae. With hindsight, these were pretty bad picks. But the book still works, because even those companies made the 15 year run that they were looking for. The reasons for greatness that they found make a great deal of sense. The concept of a level 5 leader is very strong. I have used some of the ideas and they seem to be working. Is this the final leadership answer? No. The unintended message that I got from the book seems more like the Tao; things that become great will eventually loose their greatness no matter what. This book was written and researched during the roaring 1990s when profits piled up faster than leaves in the autumn where I live. Jim Collins, who wrote another book thousands have read, led the research team that set out to find out why the highest performing companies outperformed their competition. He did this by saying it was the result of a laundry list of characteristics from having humble CEOs recruited from inside the company to not particularly paying attention to technology to hiring the right people to get the job done.While all these attributes may contribute to succeess, the falure of this book was presaged in its first chapter, on pages 14-15 of the hardcopy version, where it asks and answers the mock question: \"Will your findings continue in the new economy? The truth is, there's nothing new about the new economy.\" Anyone that had money in the stock market in September 2008, especially those that held stock in General Motors, knows the \"new\" economy is much different than the one anyone's seen going back to 1930. And all Collins' exemplars in this book bit the dust -- most doing so long before 2008.Collins proof is in the pudding exemplars are 11 corporations whose stock values shot up at twice the rate of their competitiors during his period of research in the bamboozled economy of the 1990s that burned white hot. Today, less than two decades later, two of those companies are out of business, one has been liquidated, another had been bought by a bigger corporation, and all but one of the 11 had serious stock value declines by 2006, before the market meltdown of autumn 2008. Wells Fargo, the hero of chapter three, saw its stock value decline so greatly in the 2008 market meltdown that it became the poster boy company for federal bank bailout money the next year.This chapter, and this company, are highlighted as successful leaders that bought out a similar bank, then got rid of all its employees. While such work was commonplace in the takeover mania of the 1980s, it was rarely heralded as find business practice anywhere but in this \"study.\" Collins crew says Wells Fargo handled it properly because the people from the other bank wouldn't fit into the new company's business culture. The expeditious departure of long-time employees reminded me of Jimmy Hoffa's line in the movie of the same nameHoffa. Once elected international Teamsters president, Hoffa (nee Jack Nicholson with a bad haircut) turned to his assistant and told him, You're going to fire half these yokels tomorrow. Don't put it off so the other half will be secure and stay loyal.\" While this happens in business all over the world, there's no reason to suggest it is a good practice.The bigger failure of the book is what actually happened to Collins' 11 exemplars of rising stock markets values. I looked at the stock values of each of the companies (the ones still in business) and all went backwards less than 15 years after this famous book -- and its recipe for success -- were written. Maybe the research team would say the management teams changed; otherwise, how can this book still be relevant as a model of business success in 2010? I think probably because the advice given is superficial, contradictory, and be can interpreted differently enough by any reader that is can be germane in the post-9/11, post 2008 recession world.Fortunately, you don't have to read this book to understand what these are. The precepts of success in business are the same today as they were in the earlier days of the free market -- hard work, market segmentation and differentiation, effective capitalization, high risk/reward ratio, and dedication to customer service. Most of those values and practices aren't cited herein and you can largely ignore the ones that are. This book reads very much like reading a textbook however it is well worth the effort. The book have massive amounts of research to back their claims and make very valid comments that you can apply in a work setting. Being a young manager (25) yet having over 85 employees reporting to me I am able to use this information to my advantage. This should be a must read for all business universities! Possibly the best business book I've ever read, or at least the best that wasn't a journalistic narrative or a history. Most business &quot;advice&quot; books really just amount to hero worship (how to be like Jack Welch, or whoever), and Good to Great is a strong antidote to all that rot. While we gravitate toward big personalities and dramatic stories, the real roots of greatness like elsewhere -- the CEO names in Good to Great won't be familiar to most readers, but their successes are real, and Collins and his team do a nice job of extracting meaning from the data they've assembled. One among many surprising conclusions is that charismatic leaders might actually be a *detriment* to their firms. Then again, after Ebbers, Skilling, and others, maybe we won't find that news so surprising any more... Anyway, the book is clearly written and thoughtfully organized, and well worth reading if you're interested, for whatever reason, in what makes some companies thrive and others fail. A wise book. Watch as these companies dominate their industry with CEOs that put the company before their own personas. Jim Collins puts forward one of the great concepts in business...and in life...that getting the right people in the right situations is the best staple of great leadership. Collins' message can be applied to any situation (business, sports, education, etc.). He has an engaging writing style and uses a wide variety of companies to illustrate his central theme of leadership as leading to great success. Collins also illustrates the great importance of a humble leader, one who gives of him/herself for the betterment of the system as a whole. This was a fascinating read, and you will close the book with a great deal of insight into how you run both your professional and personal life. A terrific, terrific read. In fact, I have gone back and begun to read Built to Last, which is actually the prequel to Good to Great. I honestly could not recommend this book more than I do. If you want to lead your company to greatness, read this book. If not, don't bother; you won't understand or appreciate it. The book is best read slowly, carefully, and analytically...with highlighter or notepad close at hand. You will find each chapter through-provoking, inspirational, and stimulating. Savvy readers will be motivated to initiate specific actions before even completing the book.&quot;Good to Great&quot; is actually, in the author's mind, a prequel to his best-selling &quot;Built to Last.&quot; It's a research-based report of what it takes to move from being a good company to a great company. His focus is on organizations that have sustained great results for at least 15 years. The selection criteria, explained in the book, were tough. The book examines companies that moved from mediocrity to extraordinary performance, exploring how they did it and what common lessons might be learned.Is this usable information for your company? Collins asserts &quot;Our five-year quest yielded many insights, a number of them surprising and quite contrary to conventional wisdom, but one giant conclusion stands out above the others: We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've uncovered.&quot;The chapters are organized according to what Collins and his researchers learned makes companies great: Good is the Enemy of Great, Level 5 Leadership, First Who, then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline, and Technology Accelerators. The book moves then to explain the flywheel and doom loop concepts that enable the other factors to either enable the company build momentum to high achievement or wind down to a whimper and drop off the radar screen. Closing the book, Collins relates this work to his previous work reported in &quot;Built to Last.&quot; The Frequently Asked Questions epilogue helps tighten the readers' focus, as do the summaries at the end of each chapter. There are several research appendices for those who wish to look behind the curtain.This is a powerful book with a wealth of messages about how the eleven Great Companies did it. Example follows example, with painfully simple methodology. Amazingly, most executives and managers get in their own way, making it impossible for them to make the leap from good to great. The companies Collins used to compare against his chosen few suffered from that dilemma, and Collins names names to tell the story of exactly what happened-or didn't happen. Expect to be a bit embarrassed by what you have done or not done, but at the same time educated about what you need to do now.You may not agree with everything you read in &quot;Good to Great,&quot; but you'll think. And you'll act. And that makes a book powerful. This is a book you'll recommend to others. This fast paced book was required reading for my company's management team and then became required reading for the entire company! Full of interesting case studies and comparisons, it sheds light on key concepts that will be helpful to any size organization. This book provides valuable insight into the keys to greatness on multiple levels - from individual employees to senior management to the company as a whole. Some of the examples may be dated (Fannie Mae most of all), but within the parameters of their research it makes sense. No matter what level of the ladder you're currently on, or where your ambitions are aimed, this book can give perspective that will aid in achieving your professional goals. Exactly what is it that makes one company stand out among others as a symbol of effective and efficient management? What factors are the most critical to long term success? Why do some companies seem to succeed so easily while others can barely keep their heads above water?In \"Good to Great\", author Jim Collins and his team of research specialists attempt to answer these and other questions about corporate management. These individuals conducted hundreds of interviews and gathered together thousands of statistics on corporations in all sorts of different industries in order to compile a list of companies that exemplify excellence in corporate management.The companies that are highlighted in this book earned their coveted rating based on their ability to outperform companies in similar industries after first undergoing a period of turmoil. The eleven \"superstar\" companies are: Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Phillip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo. In each instance, these companies experienced a period of time where growth and financial prospects looked bleak. Then, they responded with expert planning and a sound managerial vision and came back stronger than ever before.Besides these 11 success stories, Collins also highlights some companies who failed to respond quickly enough to market changes and ended up in the trash heap of corporate history. An example here is the grocery chain A&P.; This once successful company was reduced to nothing and eventually closed its doors for good because its management team refused to recognize the need to change and adapt to new market conditions and management changes. Had it responded more quickly and embraced change, A&P; might still be among the largest U.S. companies. But its management failed to adapt, and it went bankrupt.This is a very good management book overall, and its data is backed up by concrete figures. What you get in this book are the cold hard facts, not merely the opinions of the author. Collins doesn't just ramble on about his own personal feelings on management and why he thinks one company is better than the others. He lets the track record speak for itself.Author Jim Collins and his team deserve a lot of credit for writing this insightful, well- researched book about corporate management. It would have been nice if he had expanded his writing to include more than just these 11 \"superstar\" companies. Still, \"Good to Great\" is one of the better management books that I have read in the past several years. It provides valuable insight into what works and what doesn't work in the world of corporate management. Imagine 1,024 people participating in a coin-flipping exercise.Those who flip heads \"win,\" those who flip tails are eliminated.Now let's assume that the coin-flipping adheres to the norm--that is, a flip yields heads half the time, and tails half the time. And let's do the flip-and-elimination exercise 10 times.At the end, out of 1024 competitors, you should have one winner who's flipped 10 consecutive heads.Is the winner great at flipping heads? No. Is the winner lucky? No. Is the winner inevitable? YES.And that's the problem with Jim Collins' dunderheaded exercise--he's wowed by the winning coin flipper's success. He can't wait to interview the flipping champion, pore over the data to recreate the sheer drama/moments of truth surrounding each individual flip, find the subtle nuances beneath the flipper's consistent performance, and draw universally applicable lessons from the coin flipper's astounding success. I mean, how can anyone argue with TEN CONSECUTIVE flips of heads, right?Um, actually everyone should argue with it, Jimmy.Just like Tom Peters did fifteen years before with In Search of Excellence, Collins sanctifies his business winners, completely overlooking the fact that 1) plenty of business losers followed IDENTICAL strategies and still lost and 2) if you have any criteria for excellence that generates more than zero companies pulled from a universe of more than zero companies, then one or more companies MUST, by definition, make the cut, which leads us to 3) so what?--without a statistically rigorous analysis, there's a fairly serious possibility that a number of companies are making the cut randomly. Collins really stumbles on this last one--without statistical proof, not only can't he distinguish between Good and Great, he can't even make the call between Good and Kind of Random, Dude.Like Collins' masquerade, Peters' book was a big hit, but followers of Peters soon ran into the Law of George Bernard Shaw--Time Wounds All Heels; most of the companies Peters championed in his book quickly floundered. Some of Collins' sainted companies are already floundering as well...Books like Good to Great prey on the fact that you napped through statistics--if you'd been caffeined up during those dull lectures, you'd have remembered the fallacy of composition (the coin flipper's exercise), the distinction between random outcomes and relevant ones, and the enormous difference between what's causal and what's coincidental.Look, there's nothing new in business: there are only a few basic strategies, and only a few macro and microeconomic truths. Ever notice how fads like supply side economics, the Japanization of America, the endless bull market, the end of history, The New Economy and the Macarena all seemed to collapse under the weight of basic market concepts you already knew?So SNAP OUT OF IT, gulp down that double espresso, go back to your old and boring (but still accurate and useful) Michael Porter, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Benjamin Graham, and Burton Malkiel, and stop chasing misallocated or downright blockheaded metaphors from Who Moved My Cheese, The Art of War and poor, misunderstood Charles Darwin, and for God's sake, please take a pass on this Three Card Monte of a book. Hallelujah - someone decided to drill down and understand the real reasons companies become great, instead of listening to the overblown hype of egocentric CEO's. Thank you Mr. Collins. The book is very good although not much info.Summery: Let only great people on the bus (your company payroll),stay humble, work hard, find out what you can do better then anyone and when you do keep that profit wheel turning(newtons law). Also don't expect great results in business unless you give it your all for 15 - 20 years. Hard labor and then die rich and humble, because level 5 leaders don't stand out.John HalloranCertified Gold Exchange, Inc This book is an amazing take on business management. Providing a look into very unlikely factors that contribute to great companies, Jim Collins has written a masterpiece worth any reader's time. I had to read it for a class but would highly recommend it to anyone. This is one of the best books I have read for a long time. The author proposes to study more than 1500 good companies and select criteria which would make a good company GREAT. Companies and their CEOs, in general, are more than ever focused on making money without making decent products or providing good service. They might be viable in the short time, but never became great in long range. The great companies, however, prospered because they did both.The book illustrates a few basic points worth remmbering:#1. The CEO should work for the company, and not the other way around.#2. He should look for the right people, instead of filling his Board with friends or cronies in order to have total control of the company.#3. The company should have discipline: disciplined people, thought and action.#4. The company should have basic core values.If all the companies just follow a few of these rules, they not only would be immensely successful, but also won't have to fudge their books. This book has been recommended by many and many professors and colleagues. I now offer my recommendation for this book to you. Get this book! Author does a fantastic job as the reader of his book. Insight and reflection of the changes given since the print of the book were priceless. Well worth the money and time. This book is fantastic! If your CEO of a company or just interested in management, then this a must read! I admit that I opened this book with cynicism. My boss gave me a copy and told me I should read it with an open mind; that I should know what corporate executives mean when they natter on about hedgehogs and being on or off the bus. I'm no big fan of managing by the latest trendy fad and I assumed this book would fall into that category.In spite of my prejudice, I enjoyed this book. I didn't see any flaw in the methodology and I like the idea of collecting the data and following it where it leads. The bottom line, in my mind, is that leaders who believe in something bigger than themselves (a religious or quasi-religious concept) can enable and lead organizations to greatness. As an additional plus, it looks like Jim Collins `ate his own dog food'; he used the lessons learned to lead the research and writing team with great result. This book is interesting and fun to read.Ken Coffman is the author of Glen Wilson's Bad Medicine and other novels. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to take their business from good to great!An outstanding guide based on true experiences, I found each lesson to be easily applicable in running my business.I have breakfast once a week with a group of businessmen in our town and we communicate throughout the rest of the week using ehuddle.com. When some of us were reading this book it the emails started to fly back and forth. We all agreed it was not good - it was great! Although Jim Collins' Built to Last was a well researched book with outstanding concepts, Good to Great builds on them so significantly that it truly is a quantum step beyond. Good to Great explores what it takes to really develop a business team which will produce results far and beyond the typical. It puts the burden on the leader in a practical but tough way. As a business leader, this book made me rethink everything I was doing.Good to Great does two things extremely well. First, all of the points are backed up by data. Just like his first book, the author uses extensive analysis of companies to identify 19 companies that are truly great. Although time has affected some of these, the long-term principles do not. Second, he boils down the principles of leadership and team dynamics to some simple, practical, but lofty targets.This book defines what can make a great company. The material presented from Jim Collins is profoundly well organized and based on REAL research and information. He is very candid about what the facts do and don't support. This \"book\" is not a blah, blah, blah management THEORY based on the THEORY about THEORY. Jim's dissertation is based on facts, and the how those facts apply to useful truth. In this regard, I believe Good to Great presents a very solid body of information beneficial to anyone interested in doing better buisiness. And, it's very enjoyable too. I can confirm many of the ideas in this book from my own research on Superperformance. There is a consistent pattern that underlies high performing companies of every stripe. It is interesting to note that many of the companies lauded in GOOD TO GREAT and BUILT TO LAST are no longer shining so bright. Succession planning should focus on sustaining the 'way of being' not the CEO.also readSuperperformance Great people with great passion and great thoughts play the course - not their competitor. The reason this book is good because it not only tells you what works, it tells you what doesn't work as well. There's a site called the Not Yet Successful Entrepreneur Zone... that features stories of failed businesses. Reading these stories are useful because you can learn from others' mistakes. This book was number one on the Wall Street Journal's list for a long time for good reason. It is a very pleasurable and easy read that will certainly set off light bulbs in your head. The coverage of the iterative process of buildup and breakthrough is outstanding. If you are an executive, manager, or entrepreneur, make sure you grab this book and take it to the beach or knock it out over a weekend. It certainly belongs in your library. What a big and slow book! Very systematical, easy-to-understand, but only borderline inspiring. The message is good, but can be equally well-explained with a big chart - I'd rather have a Sparknotes version of the book in a paperback manual format. If you haven't read Built to Last, you've heard ideas from it...they've been all over since that one was published, they are too good to resist.This is at least as good. Out of the 20 smartest executives I have worked with, in three major companies this year, probably 15 have dropped references to it in our conversation. This book is amazing! It is definitely one of my favorites. It gives great advice about building a great company which can also be used to become a better person Collins (2001) \"Good to Great\" is a must read. It represents the value of research, analysis, and debate of data for the goal of deeper understanding. His research is so well grounded that it is difficult to identify any gaps in his findings. Some of his findings are controversial and he discusses these at the end of his book in an honest and open way.We would have liked the book to have even more detail: more stories, biographies, data, and analysis since it was so well written. The \"great\" companies and their comparison companies offer incredibly rich environments for the research - we especially enjoyed the discussions of Nucor and Bethlehem Steel.The reader should take time to reflect and personalize the \"Hedgehog Concept\" and identify where their three circles intersect. It may take some time and it may even require the reader to reread the book; but these central concepts are crucial for personal and professional growth.We look forward to Collin's future works. This was recommended to me by someone who over-hyped it. I was not expecting much. He was right...again! I have never owned a company, but this speaks to the middle manager as much as to the CEO. It even speaks to the personal. (Although I'm not sure you can throw kids off your family bus; you sort of have to wait for them to graduate first.)The amount of research that must have gone into this book is just amazing. It made me look at the office I was building and determine what kind of legacy I wanted after I was gone and what kind of manager I wanted to be. If you enjoy business reading, you will enjoy this book. A fun, flowing read with useful conversation material throughout. Learn change secrets from the best. Great practical ideas. How refreshing it is to see a passionate individual pursue an idea to completion and take the time to fully investigate all possibilities.It's been a great addition to my book club at work. Very nice product....Very slow shipping.Just took a very long time to ship it to me..... I read this book as part of a leadership class I am taking and to be honest, I was dreading reading it. However, it was very interesting and grabbed me by the end of the first chapter and I enjoyed every page of this informative book. I applaud Jim Collins and his team on the incredibly detailed comparisons that were used as examples of companies that went from good companies to great ones and what it took for those companies to achieve greatness. If I ever find myself in a situation to help make leadership decisions I will definitely remember what I learned from this book. I highly recommend you read this book if you are in a position of leadership within your company, or ever plan on working your way to the top! As a member of our local school board, I bought this book in search of ways to improve our school. As I read the book, I kept thinking things like, 'now that makes sense' and 'I never thought about it that way but it works'! School boards face constrictions that do not apply in industry or business and that limits some application of the principles in this book.., For example, we can't just fire someone because we determine they are not the 'right person'. We can, however, use the principles in this book in a long term plan to 'get the right people on the bus', and to 'stop doing the things that don't work'. I was particurlarly interested in the description of a level 5 manager. How many school superintendents or principals have you known that could be described as 'self effacing'? The book is a good read with wider implications than just business. This book is Leader's Read for Visionaries World Wide and it delivers a very organized and through approach to discovering your personal as well as any company's economic denominator. Collins is insightful and detailed. This is a book you read with a pencil or a highlighter, for sure. It is an excellent source for discourse if you are mentoring entrepreneurs. I asked for a quick delivery and got it. The book was in flawless condition!Thank you for keeping both promises. I don't need much to write here as hundreds of people has written review for this book.In simple terms the book is easy to read & understand. Analyze how best companies manage to retain their position by innovative & intelligent leadership. Research is sound & findings are really interesting. This book would be useful for any leader (or follower) even if they are not into financial sector.The concept of \"Good is the enemy of Great\" struck me the mostDefinitely worth for its price. Anyone who owns a company and has people working for them will benefit greatly from reading this title and applying it to their everday life. It contains some very powerful and useful concepts that anyone can apply. It's well written and an easy read! I definitely recommend this reading for those who aim to make difference in their companies. I know a few business owners who desperately need this book. Collins points out what should be common sense but isn't: the key to corporate success is discipline. A company needs to take control of itself, its employees, and its resources and get everything moving in the same direction. Collins and his team engaged in an incredible amount of research, and manage to lay out the results in clear and concise dialogue. Instead of being full of catch phrases and feel good mantras like so many other so-called success books, Good to Great actually provides real information and practically step by step instructions on getting your company on track in a positive way.",

         "Ok, I'm not usually a fan of an older woman/younger man romance, but after reading \"Welcome To Temptation\" by this author, I had to read every word she's written! I've occasionally been disappointed by the earlier works of my favorites, but this story lived up to the promise. Sure, it was too short, and yes, I wanted more of these characters and this relationship. But it was still a delightful read and another fine example of Jennifer Crusie's amazing talent for witty dialogue and finding the humor in human relationships. Add in some Daffy Duck pants and a droopy dog dragging a red lace bra, and you've got a winner! Nina, 40 years old and recently divorced, decides to get herself a puppy to cheer herself up, but her trip to the pound leads her to Fred, a languid basset hound who she takes home instead. Through humorous circumstances, Fred facilitates an introduction between Nina and her downstairs neighbor, Alex, a 30 year old ER resident who is fed up with dating women who are just looking for a good catch. Nina and Alex are perfect for each other, of course, but each of them finds reasons to resist their growing attraction.I haven't liked some of the previous Jennifer Cruise books I've tried, but when I saw the adorable dog on the cover, I couldn't resist. Fred, in a supporting role, steals the show, but the other supporting characters--including Charity, Nina's best friend who is writing a book about her own exploits in love, and Max, Alex's womanizing older brother--lend quite a bit of of humor as well. This novel is a fun, quick read that I'd rate 4 1/2 stars; definitely recommended as great light reading. It was a good read, but too short. I love Jennifer Crusies books and will always be a fan. I wish this book was a bit longer though. It's the story of recent divorcee Nina who gets a dog to cheer up her life, and then meets her studly neighbor Alex. Now, he's thirty and she's forty, and she thinks he's just a boy toy, but he's a doctor, and a sweet one at that. I'd heard a lot about JC and she did not disappoint. I loved this book! This is vintage and classic Crusie, show casing her best talent. A simple, fast romance, peppered with a lot of humor. Fred is the best, and his antics made me laugh out loud more than once. You care about each and everyone of the characters through the book.A highly recommended read. I finished it in one night! As a long term Jennifer Crusie fan, I am 100% satisfied with this book! This is my new favorite! Crusie has done it for me again. This is the second book of hers that I've read, the first one was \"Bet Me.\" I love this author! I am drawn to her characters. I was desperate for Alex and Nina to get together. I loved their budding relationship. I enjoyed the other characters as well, especially the 75 year old physically fit neighbor Norma. One of the best things about Crusie is how frequently she has me laughing out loud. I plan to read every one of her books. Note, I am reviewing the book, not the audio cd, which I have not heard. Sexual content: moderate. The characters were great and believable - especially Fred. :) Found this available on my library's Overdrive ebook offerings, but I'd have spent a modest amount on it. It's a pretty good read. This is one of Crusie's older books republished. It's light and entertaining.Plot: boy likes girl, girl likes boy but is sure she's too old for him and befriends him instead, Fred the dog plays matchmaker. The dog steals the show. Nina is coming out of a bad marriage and enjoying her freedom. Alex is a laid back guy from a family of high achiever specialized doctors who are trying to pressure him to be like them. Nina is ten years older than Alex, an unusual twist and handled very well. A really enjoyable, fast read. Nina Askew married a professional man and put her career on hold for him. She had an expensive house and an upscale lifestyle. Then she got fed up with the married life, living for someone else and having all her decisions made for her. So, now, six months after her divorce, she's sold the big house, moved into a cozy apartment, and started working as an editor again. Only Nina just turned forty and isn't dealing well with it. All she needs is a perky little puppy to cheer her up and keep her company. Enter Fred, part basset hound, part beagle, and on his last day of life. He's not a puppy and he's not perky, but Nina just can't leave him behind knowing she's his last chance. Neither Nina or Fred are too sure about each other at first, but it doesn't take Nina long to figure out that Fred was just what she needed.Dr. Alex Moore, the thirty year old hottie who's apartment is right below Nina's, has just broken up with Debbie, another in a long line of girlfriends looking to marry a doctor and create a happy family. The problem is Alex doesn't want a family. His family is a dysfunctional disaster. Everyone's a dr, his dad's an alcoholic cardiologist, his stepmom is an recovering speed addict thoracic surgeon, his often engaged half-sister is an oncologist, and his serial dating semi-alcoholic half-brother is a gynecologist and they're putting pressure on him to specialize instead of working in the ER, where he's happy. Then Fred pops in his window and he meets Nina. There's an instant attraction that neither of them is too keen to explore right away. After a failed date, where Nina comes to the rescue, Alex decides he'd really like to get to know Nina better. So he invites himself up to her apartment to watch movies. This becomes a routine and they become fast friends. Unfortunately for Alex, he wants a whole lot more. He's afraid if he makes a move he'll lose what he has with Nina because he's pretty sure Nina sees him as an immature kid. Now he's rethinking his whole career. He's thinking of taking his dad up on a cardiology position so that he'll have money and Nina will see he's getting somewhere. But is that what Nina really wants?I'll lead off by saying that I liked both lead characters a lot. They seemed very real and like they were good people. I really loved Alex, even when he went a little crazy there and you kind of wanted to smack him upside the head so that he's just snap out of it. He was just so cute ... him and his Daffy Duck shorts. His brother Max was also highly lovable and I hope to see him hook up with Nina's friend Charity in another book. They seemed to hate each other on sight, but I think there might be something there. Nina was great, but I though the whole Incredibra issue was flat out ridiculous! I'm thirty and have had a couple of kids, so the girls aren't where they used to be, but to get that uptight over having your lover see you nekkid? If you can't stand for them to see you sans clothing, then you probably aren't ready to be sleeping with them. Her insecurities were a little overplayed, I think. She just mentioned her forty year old body one too many times for me. I have yet to read a book by this author that I did not find delightful. Enjoyed it. Will keep reading her books. Thanks A very sweet, sexy, lovely book! I've recently become a fan of Crusie, having been knocked off my feet with \"Welcome to Temptation.\" I actually enjoyed this early writing style a bit more because it didn't have as much of that weird run-on sentence stuff that she does.My only complaint is that it was too short -- only 224 pages in a smaller-than-usual hardback. I wanted more of the relationship after they finally admitted their feelings. It went from their fabulous first night together to arguing about their future.But I really loved it and can highly recommend it. Interesting characters, excellent dialogue and steamy love scenes. A great way to spend an afternoon! Enjoyable read, not the typical damsel in distress. A modern heroine with strength. I would definitely read other books by this author. If you are ever sad, or blue, or just want to laugh until you afraid you are going to have to change your jeans, this is in all ways the author for you! Ms. Cruise is an absolute riot, while still writing solidly. You Have to try these books! I am adding all of them to my \"must buy\" list. Lots of laughs, always a happy ending? Oh, yea baby! I found this book to be very entertaining. I actually laughed out loud & I rarely find myself doing that reading a book. The characters were all lovable, especially Fred, the dog. Lots of romance, attraction & angst . . . I requested this book from a bookswap purely on the basis of The Popcorn Dialogues. I know Jennifer Crusie as one half of Jenny Crusie and Lucy March (aka Lani Diane Rich), and I've enjoyed their occasionally wine-glazed podcasts on what makes movies good or bad (\"Lord, it wasn't good\" - I am required by natural law to admire and applaud anyone who quotes Bloom County). They are both sharp, smart, very funny ladies (who know and love Bloom County), and there is always the hope that personality really will come out in a person's writing.And, you know, it does here. I'm not at all sorry I asked for this book, nor that I read it. I don't mean that as damning with faint praise - really, I opened the book-shaped package with the Goodreads bookswap label and questioned my judgment for a minute. With a thousand books out there I know I want, I chose a possibly stupid romance novel? But: PopD. Then a GR friend recommended Jennifer Crusie in an unrelated conversation, and I picked up poor maligned Anyone But You.Jenny's personality holds true from the podcasts to the novel, and it's just plain fun. This is chick lit in its purest form, very nicely written, funny - wry, even - with an older heroine (older than the usual 20-year-old, I mean) who is not a size two, a hero who is not perfect but also not Tragically Flawed, and just a ...well, a fun story with a touch of fairy tale about it. It's sweet - a quick candy read, and one of the better brands of candy at that. Four stars out of sheer sentimental gooeyness. A thirty year old serial dater and a forty year old divorcee becoming a match made in heaven by a far less than energetic dog named Fred. What a story to tell!! I fell in love with the book after the first chapter, laughed so hard by the third chapter.... and fell in love with the characters all the way to the end.This is one enjoyable book if you are looking for one that manages to have wit, charm and spark. A humble story about overcoming personal hurdles for love. Yep, Fred, the less than perky dog, plays cupid to make a match made in heaven. Two people not looking for anything serious, but become serious in the end. Heartwarming and funny... I highly recommend this book!! Jennifer Crusie is always a good read for me when I want pure entertainment. While I don't think this one is as good a several of her other books, it IS a decent little mental health break. Crusie always brings on some great wit and dialogue that just makes me enjoy her characters. They are people I wouldn't mind KNOWING in real life. I feel like she created a new type of romance book. Never would I be attracted to the old style of \"bulging, heaving...blah, blah, blah\" type of Hqn Romance. But Crusie gives her characters BRAINS, strength, humor and a good dose of HUMANITY. They have their good/great qualities and they have their weaker/screw up qualities that make them all pretty much just like ALL OF US... To me this is the hook. This story is no different...she lets you come to KNOW the characters and shake your head at their mistakes, root for their successes in figuring out what to do and relate to the sure knowledge that if you live life with a willingness to take a little chance and plow forward, the odds are pretty good you'll HAVE a life worth living! I just love Jennifers book and this one is right up there with the rest. A little slow to get started but then it grabs you and is a very funny, romantic read. I have read it several times already! This is one you will go back to. Not going to write a summary of the book since it's already been covered in other reviews. But I will say that this is one of my all time faves of Jennifer Crusie! Fun and sexy! Don't hesitate to read it! This book was great fun. The action kept you engaged and the dialog was snappy. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading and an escape for a little while. This is not my favorite Crusie book, but it is still a good one. I like Crusie's characters because they have some flaws to work around. They aren't the perfect people we see on TV. This book is about the need to sometimes throw away preconceived notions and insecurities and see ourselves as other people might see us. I'd say the book starts out somewhat superficial, but gains a story line as it moves along. The audio version is well read by Susan Ericksen. Another book of hers I read years ago, I just read it again recently and laughed just as hard. This is another funny, sexy story in a way only Ms. Crusie could write, love this woman! Anyone But YouBy Jennifer CrusieNina is turning forty and after years of being married to a controlling man she is finally free and has decided her life needs a cute perky puppy, but then she sees Fred. Fred is mild aged and smelly and on his way to being put down in the local shelter. When she brings him back to her apartment she teaches him to use the fire escape to let himself out and in, on one of his excursions he stumbles upon Nina's downstairs neighbor thirty year old gorgeous doctor Alex. Soon Nina and Alex find themselves in a fun and flirtatious friendship but nothing more Nina knows she is too old for him until one day she winds up in his E.R. and realizes he isn't as immature as he seems.This was such a cute book with witty commentary and the most adorable dog. It is funny and well written the two combined bring to life a beautiful romance. The trials the two must overcome to be together are realistic which adds to the drama of this novel and in the end, like all good romances, there is a happily ever after. If you are a fan of contemporary romance, you should definitely give this one a try it is sure to please. Jennifer Crusie writes fun books. Though a light read are perfect for the beach or if your really busy. Classic Jennifer Crusie - two unlikely characters living right above/below each other. Fred the dog is a riot, and the perfect \"extra\" character. I love the \"slightly oler woman\"/younger man concept - a woman not so confident in her appearance, and the guy who disagrees, thinks she's hot just like she is!As usual while listening to Jennifer's books, I frequently laughed out loud, and replayed a few lines to be sure I heard what I thought I heard! I wonder if Jennifer Cruise owns a dog and if that particular dog have somehow changed her life. In Anyone But You, a dog changed her life by bringing in a man. By the way in her other book, Crazy For You, a dog also changed the main character's life.Anywayz this dog called Fred brings Nina a 10-years-younger-than-her blonde cutie. He's her neighbor downstairs, in the second floor and she's on the third floor. It's funny because of the issues they go through but they're a cute couple. Especially since they were brought together by a dog called Fred.",

         "This is an amazing book. Ms. Kay has successfully filled in the missing pages of the Phantom's life, and I know that M. Leroux would only applaud her effort. For anyone starting on the road of Phantom Phandom, or anyone that is on the journey already, this is a must book. Not only do we see Erik growing up as a lonely,forlorn child, but we see his character develop as he is driven mercilessly on the road that will bring him to the Opera House in Paris. The 'lost' pages from Leroux's book are found here as Erik is caught up in a hopeless attraction for a young woman, and her frightened reaction to him. What is it about this forlorn man that has Christine coming back to him? All is explained here, with passion, love, and understanding. No one is treated unkindly, as all are flawed human beings, and that in the end, is enough to make tears flow. A MUST have! I consider myself a TRUE Phantom of the Opera fan and was very skeptical of this book. I almost didn't read it because I didn't want anything to taint the original version. As a matter of fact, I didn't buy this book for myself - it was a gift. I had no intention of buying a copy-cat. Don't make the same mistake I almost made. This book if fabulous! A must read! I am back at amazon to order a couple more copies for my best friends. This book compliments the original Phantom of the Opera so well, and it is impossible to put down. Note: Have some Kleenex nearby! Wonderful! I just can't give this more than a 3 star rating, however well written. This is a really interesting take on Erik's back story, and if taken for purely that, then its well worth a read. The main area that just doesn't lend itself to credibility is her timeline for Erik. There is just no way that Erik (born 1831 according to Kay) would be 50 yrs old for the culminating events of Phantom. Sorry, but that is stretching credibility way too far. Few people, especially someone like Christine (feather-headed though she may be) could have brought herself to bridge a 30 yr age gap. I can buy Eric at 29, even 35, but not 50. Even Leroux, with all his cryptic hints did not characterize Erik as 50 by the end of Phantom; unless I missed that bit in the 27 times reading his book, which is possible I guess, but unlikely.Phantom I picked this book up many years ago in my hometown bookstore on the sales shelf for 25 cents. After reading the first chapter I was hooked! The book tells the tragic story of Eric so well and breaks your heart to read all that he had to suffer through in his life. This Has been my favorite book and I have read it probably 5 times now. Everytime I cant help but get caught up in the spellbinding story of the Phantom of the Opera! If you enjoyed the movie that just recently came out or even the opera that has played for years now, you will love Susan Kay's telling of Phantom! In this book Susan Kay takes a monster and makes you fall in love with him. He has been turned into a man who can murder someone in a heartbeat and not break a sweat or blink an eye, and yet the audience aches for him. Every time I'm done reading this book (that I have now read at least five times, and I RARELY read a book more than once) I spend at least a week really missing Erik. She draws you into his world, and it's very hard to let go. Yes, I realize that I am the first reviewer not to give Susan Kay's outstanding book 'Phantom' a perfect '10' -please don't throw tomatoes Phantom Phans! *duck*- but that is a reflection of my severe reviewing style and not meant to throw any fault on Kay's novel. Actually I have never given a perfect '10' to any book (even to my all-time favorite) and in fact I believe that Susan Kay's writing is worth a 9.5.(but Amazon only gives you the choice of a '9' or '10' sooooo....)Grading aside,by far Susan Kay's 'Phantom' is the best interpretation of the 'Phantom of the Opera' incarnation yet written. She spins out a very human retelling of the myth of the 'Opera Ghost' and adds a new dimension to the story by delving into Erik's (aka 'The Phantom') life before the famous events portrayed in Gaston Leroux's 'The Phantom of the Opera'.'Phantom' is definately a 'must have' for anyone who enjoys the story of The Phantom of the Opera or for anyone simply in search of a book that will grab and hold your attention from the first few pages. While 'Phantom' can stand on its own as a novel,it acts as a great suppliment to the original by Leroux,filling in many of the details left sketchy by the original. I believe that Kay's story must be read to fully experience and gain a true perception of the of the tragedy in the Phantom's life.The only complaint I have against the book was that it wasn't long enough! ;) Even at 400 pages I zipped through 'Phantom' in 2 days and was sorrowful when it was over!As Erik could not help but fall in love with Christine,readers can't help but fall in love with 'Phantom'! Choose to read Kay and fall in love with Erik's character all over again. This is one of the best books I have ever read. This is also the book I most often lend out, and everyone I know who has read it has also loved it.It is a unforgettable story, both heart breaking and haunting that should not be missed. Phantom is a jewel of a novel and every page is a master piece by itself. The story captures your interest from beginning to end, its impossible to put the novel down. An important note: always have tissues near by when reading Phantom! I read this years ago, and reread it, and reread it...It's a bit of a stretch, given the original novel, and timeline, but well written and a very fun fantasy to fall into on a cold, rainy day. Phantom Phans will especially love the more tender moments exchanged between Christine and Erik, and the friendship struck by Erik and the Daroga is well-thought out.All in all, a great read for my fellow dreamers. This is definitely the one book any fan of the Phantom of the Opera should read. Kay tells a truly powerful story - painting the Phantom as a real human being, not the kind of horrible creature he is made out to be.What is really great about this book is that it is told from many different points of view, the narration passing from the different characters, from Erik's mother, to Christine, and even the Phantom himself. The story is smooth and well rounded, with realistic and complete characters that you really feel for.Phantom is a beautiful love story, and also a tragic tale of betrayal and deceit. You will love this book, I guarantee it. One of if not the best published Phan-fiction available. Ms. Kay really delves into Erik's history with unrivaled compassion for the character: it seems no matter what he does, you can't help but find just cause and sympathy. Remarkably, it never once strikes you as a sob story, something this kind of phan-fiction falls into much too easily. Open the book and prepare to fall in love with Erik in a completely new way! This is one of the most in depth stories about the infamous Phantom of the Opera that I have ever read. I really liked how Susan Kay answered a lot of questions like: Why did Erik's mother treat him horribly? What happened in Erik's previous life that made him act the way he did towards Christine? and the most intriguing, What happened between Christine and Erik during their lessons? A definite must read for those who enjoyed Gaston Leroux's novel, but still had unanswered questions. Excellent, well written book. Answers the questions regarding the phantom that you can't get from the play or movie. Tried reading the original Phantom of the Opera, but the prose weren't to my liking, couldn't put this book down! All of us have been there, I'm sure. It might have been with a movie, it might have been with a TV series, it might have been a play. Whatever it is, we've all encountered a story that we fell in love with, that we were enjoying, which seemed like a tour de force all through the beginning and middle, and then as the end draws near little problems start cropping up, characters start to act unbelievably, notes begin to sour, the whole production seems to start stumbling. And we soldier on, hoping that it can still recover, because the rest was JUST SO GOOD. But it doesn't, and by the end, it just leaves us deeply ambivalent. \"Phantom\" by Susan Kay is just such a story. I cannot decide how I feel about it.Having long been an obsessive over all things Phantom of the Opera (and especially Leroux's original novel), I could not avoid hearing about Susan Kay's much-lauded biography of Erik. Indeed, one would have to be sequestered as deeply underground as our beloved Opera Ghost to miss having heard of it at this point! And although I have developed a great deal of wariness where sequels to established public domain gothic horror/mystery titles are concerned (the plethora of abysmal Dracula follow-ups taught me that lesson well!), the consistently high praise heaped on Kay's novel eventually enticed me to begin seeking the elusive volume.When I finally found a copy and began reading, all of its accolades seemed justified. Kay's prose might not have been the greatest in the world, but I've certainly seen worse, and I couldn't fault her plotting. It seemed to me that she had taken every obscure, mysterious little reference to the Phantom's past made by the Persian in the novel and Giry in the musical and found a way to work it into a coherent narrative, even finding plausible ways to explain the presence of Erik's mother's furniture in his subterranean lair and neat as well as providing an origin for all of those barrels of gunpowder during the whole \"Scorpion or the Grasshopper\" bit. I was consistently surprised by Kay's ingenuity in accounting for all these little bits of plot flotsam and jetsam. The only thing I felt any annoyance or confusion about in the first two-thirds or so of the book was her seeming refusal to pick whether she was working in the canon of the original novel or of the Andrew Lloyd Weber play. Just when you think you're in Leroux's world, you find a reference to \"mismatched eyes\" and \"deformed lips,\" which clearly place the Phantom's deformity in the realm of his musical theater incarnation. The insistence on blurring two very different versions of the character puzzled me.At least, it did until Kay's narrative reached the events of the original story, and the answer to my question became clear: She was not writing in either Leroux or Weber's canon, nor even in a blending of the two, but in her own. This was not a prequel, but a complete re-imagining.I cannot stress enough to an outside reader how jarring this felt. There was absolutely no warning, absolutely nothing to prepare me for this. It is the most perplexing thing I have ever seen in a novel. To devote fully two-thirds to faithfully and effectively fleshing out minor details mentioned in another work, details which only the most obsessive and devoted fans would even have thought about or wanted to know more about in the first place, only to completely depart from the characterization and spirit of the source material at the last minute is...well, \"baffling\" is too mild a word for it, but unfortunately, I don't know what the right word is. It's like listening to \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" and having the organist switch to \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" halfway through without explanation.This review is beginning to run long, so I'll forgo the temptation to make an itemized summary of all the problems of Kay's later chapters and instead comment on one specific moment which, I think, perfectly illustrates the biggest one: At some point after being taken by the Phantom through the mirror and having only fairly recently finding herself a not-entirely consensual resident of his House on the Lake, Christine discovers that he has not only completely furnished a room for her, but has procured several dresses for her, specifically tailor-made to her exact measurements. And her reaction to this is to marvel at the effort and expense he must have gone to on her behalf, and to feel awed at his love and devotion for her. Ladies, let me ask you a question: If you found yourself kidnapped by a mysterious masked man who locked you in his house and then, in the process of examining a set of expensive custom-clothes that he has gotten for you, realized that he knows *every measurement of your body down to your bra size without you ever having told him,* would YOU react with awe and admiration or would your skin start to crawl? And how do you think the original Christine of Leroux's novel would have responded?Erik is supposed to be creepy. He is a genius, he is lonely, he is pitiable and sympathetic and all of that, but at the end of the day, he's still creepy. He's a stalker, he's a murderer, he's manipulative, he's obsessed with death. He is not, never was, and never will be anything close to resembling an ideal romantic partner. This is not a small part of his character, nor an obstacle to his appeal; it is part and parcel of the whole Phantom package and a huge PART of his appeal. It's one of the reasons he still endures as a character. For Kay to have become so blind to his essential core creepiness that she can't see it even in scenes where it should be screaming off the page suggests that she never truly understood what draws people to him in the first place. All the more perplexing considering that she burdened her Phantom with a massive Oedipus Complex, which should have been milked for all the goosebumps and repulsion it was worth! (I actually seem to be in the minority of reviewers, incidentally, who felt this was NOT out of place and out of character; Christine and Erik's relationship has always had some borderline incestuous overtones, given both the gaps in their ages and her difficulty in distinguishing between the Phantom, the Angel of Music, and the ghost of her father, so it's only natural to mirror her Daddy Issues by exploring his Mommy Issues. Sadly, this disturbing and potentially fascinating plot point is never truly developed.)To make an extremely long story short, I still remain deeply ambivalent about this book. Does its early excellence excuse its later missteps? Or does its clumsy conclusion destroy its prior credibility? I still can't decide. I wish I could give this one 2 and a half stars, but I suppose I shall have to settle for a begrudging three, because I did love it up to a point.If she had ended it after the building of the Opera House, it could have been called a worthy successor to the original novel. As it stands, it's mostly a curiosity piece, and a fascinating study of how even the most meticulously researched and carefully planned novel can end up going completely astray. An utmost brilliance! Unlike other versions that signifies the relationship between Christine and Raoul to be of chief importance, or embarks upon all its pages to tell the manifest mystery of the Phantom that is but a shade of the man behind the mask, this novel's intrigue distinctly focuses on our beloved Erik. It is a story that serves to be solely the account of the Opera Ghost's haunting life, extending from Western Europe to Asia Minor to trace the footsteps of such a remarkable man. In her beautiful style of writing and artistic ingenuity, the author Susan Kay is able to provide her readers with a most profound and flawless insight into the mind of Erik, his pain, his joy, his fear...to relieve us a look of all that lies beyond the mask. And through all this, the richest conveyance of a storyline is made. Never in any page does the reader lose interest, but is drawn to pursue a most splendid unfolding. Except for perhaps personal preferences on the reader's part to the way of the plot, there is nothing I can find at fault with the novel (I especially loved the ending which others have often disapproved of, finding it to be the best part). All is told a masterful way with none of the modern language to tarnish the classical tale and telling all that is enchanting without losing authenticality and all that is sensual without being indecently suggestive. A writer myself, I look to this tour de force with great respectability. Subjectively, this is the best interpretation of the Phantom legacy. The Phantom of the Opera has intrigued readers, movie goers, and audiences for close to a century. Based on the legends of the haunting of the Paris Opera House in the mid 19th century, French author, Gaston Leroux, depicts the story of the horribly disfigured, maniacal genius who dwells in the labyrinthine bowels of the opera house. Known as \"The Phantom\" due to the mask that he wears to hide his disfigurement and his mysterious, ethereal ability to appear and disappear at will, Erik causes a serious of misfortunes and accidents to those who oppose his will. His obsessive desire to possess the beautiful and talented Christine Daae, and the extent that he will go in order to do so, are the premise of Mr. Leroux's novel.But Susan Kay's Phantom deliciously goes far beyond the intrigues of the opera house. Delving into the Phantom's past - from his horrifyingly pathetic birth until his clandestine collaboration with Charles Garnier to build the famous Opera House, Susan Kay touches every aspect of the Phantom's life. Personally, I was mesmerized by Ms. Kay's prose. The book is written in the first person from the viewpoint of various characters, beginning with Erik's mother, continuing with Erik himself, then his kind, sympathetic Italian benefactor and mentor, onto the Persian, his only friend, and then to Erik once more as he finally returns to France, determined to live the rest of his life as a bonafide recluse, hidden from the human race. But when a chance encounter exposes him to the beautiful singing voice of the lovely, yet strangely familiar Christine Daae, his life takes on a whole new meaning. From there, the first person narration alternates between Christine and Erik, and culminates 17 years after the incidents at the opera house with Raoul.Ms. Kay paints a portrait of the phantom that is not only stunning and highly seductive, but is filled with intrigue, insight, imagination, and even a few doses of wry humor. This is one rendition of the opera phantom that I would love to see brought to the big screen! I've seen the Andrew Lloyd Weber's movie version, and while I enjoyed the movie, it somehow loses something when the Phantom is depicted as a very handsome man with some disfigurement. When, in Ms. Kay's book Raoul, in speaking of the phantom, remarks that he finds it hard to believe that \"anything living could look like that\", you get a brief glimpse of how horrifying this man was supposed to be. And yet, the ironic intrigue, the whole heart of the story, was the fact that his voice was as beautiful and ethereal as his face was ugly and repulsive.Someone remarked in their review that they hated the ending - but I feel that the ending befitted the story, and it's far cry from a sad ending. At first glance, the book looks daunting because it's so thick - but Ms. Kay grabs the reader from the very first sentence of her book, and leads him on a gloriously enchanting adventure that you don't want to end. I've read the book twice now, and yet I'll still pick it up and sporadically read different parts.The book is out of print so it's not easy to come by. You can find it on Amazon and eBay, but it's very expensive. If you can find it at a flea market, yard sale, or some other type of sale, I'd pick it up quick before someone else does! I'd give this book ten stars if I could. It's the most moving version of the Phantom of the Opera I have ever read, (and I've read quite a few.) It took my breath away. No wonder Ms. Kay never wrote another book like it. It must have nearly killed her giving birth to such a wonderful creation. So for my review... don't hesitate to buy this book. You will adore it as much as I always have. I read this awhile ago and I remember really enjoying it. It is the 'story' behind the Phantom of the Opera and a version of why he was hideously disfigured and how he became the Phantom of the Opera hiding behind the mask. It starts from his birth and ends with his death and goes through his adventures and loneliness and addictions. Excellent book! Shame it is out of print. This is a must have for any phan!!!!!! Susan Kay does a wonderful job with this book and it is a great read even if you're not a phan. I would give this masterpeice a trillion stars if I could! I can't express how much I love this book! Well I guess you'll just have to read it for yourself. \"The Phantom of the Opera\" is one of the most riveting and fascinating stories in all of human history. The often harrowing yet poignant account of a severely deformed yet gifted individual stands as a lasting testimony to humanity's search for love and acceptance in a world of injustice and cruelty. Gaston Louroux's mystery/thriller novel has always been one of my favorite books. I also love Webber's beautiful musical adaptation. This novel by Susan Kay expands on the original tale. Readers are given a back story that explains Erik's possible motivations and explores his often turbulent personality. This novel also gives readers a glimpse of what happens after Louroux's novel ends.I was particularly moved by Kay's use of alternate points of view as she relates her story. The beginning of the novel is mesmerizing as we see events of trauma unfold from the perspective of Erik's mother. Another favorite section occurs when a stonemason named Geovanni befriends Erik. We are allowed to glimpse the possibility that perhaps the \"Phantom\" had a father figure in his life.The section of the book which is an interpoint narrative from the perspectives of Erik and Christine is vivid and unforgettable. The characters are well-rounded and believable.My favorite section is the conclusion which is narrated by Raoul De Changny. I have never particularly liked this character, but Kay's novel presents him as a tormented yet ultimately noble individual. I can now understand more fully Christine's dilemma. The ending of the story which Kay presents better suits all the characters and is more plausible than the musical sequel that has recently been produced.Please give this wonderful retelling a chance. God bless you all. I enjoyed reading this book, alot of others...not so much...Here's my recommendation: If you like ALW, read this. If you prefer Leroux, read with caution. If you hate romance and/or are under the age of 13, skip this one. The one word that comes to mind about this book is PERFECT. I've never read a book that flowed as wonderfully as this one. The way you get inside the characters reminded me greatly of Interview with the Vampire, yet this one ended up being much more. It has quickly become my favorite book, although it touched me so deeply i don't think i could read it again anytime soon. It took me a long time to finish the book because i kept putting it down. I knew that it was a complete story and once it was over it would be over. I dreaded finishing it because it was so wonderful i didn't want it to end. And i was terrified that the end would dissapoint me, but it was just as perfect and wonderful as the rest of the book. The book has a lot of bitterness, but in the end you're left with a feeling of 'yes, this is how it all should be'. I've watched all of the different Phantom movies there are, but this is the first book i've read. I don't think i want to read any of the other ones. The Erik in this book is the one i want the Phantom to be. Susan Kay's \"Phantom\" is regarded by many \"Phans\" as one of the best Phantom-spin off books. I would go as far and say it is far superior to any version of the story, including the musical, the films, and even the original Gaston Leroux novel. Kay's \"Phantom\" takes place from the start till the end of Erik's life. It does what most versions fail to do: give Erik a sufficient back story. This is also one of the few versions to feature the Persian, a character that appeared in the novel and in the 1925 Chaney film(my 2nd favorite film of all time). The Leroux version did not have enough time to go through the backstory of these two characters completely. What Kay does is supply us with one of the greatest friendships of all of literature. It also covers how much of a Renaissance man Erik really was. Many versions only exlpore the musical genius/horro part of Erik. Kay's Erik is a deeper character and probably the best interpretation to date. Its hard not to like this version the best, the characters are just so much deeper and enjoyable than in previous versions. \"Phantom\" is a read that will stay with you, an experience you will want to savor again and again. As I am writing this review I am reading it for the fifth time. I will probably have read it a hundred times by the time my life is finished. I first read this book when I was 13 and have read it about 30 times in the last 13 years. Obviously, I love this book. I wish the book were longer so there was more to read.Ms Kay truly understood the entire story behind Gaston Leroux's novel and she made the characters her own. I understand everyone's motivations. I like the characters because of their faults, or maybe in spite of them. The characters are deep and interesting; the plot is clear and involved without being confusing. It's a simple story, yet a complex one. There wasn't one part of this book that I didn't absolutely love.I wish the ending could've been \"happier\", but if it had any other ending, I don't think I would have been as satisfied. It's a beautiful story told by a masterful storyteller. Phantom is a beautifully moving tale of the life of Erik. I have read this book about 16 times. It is so well written that I feel that I am there seeing the world through the eyes of this scorned genius. The Phantom of the Opera is a story that will always fuel the imagination and leave the reader in a state of weeping bliss. Without a doubt the most beautifully written adaption of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; ever! I'm a huge fan (or 'phan' as we admirers of him are nicknamed) of the story and of the phantom myself so when I went in search of other phantom products (I had already fallen in love with the entire musical and had bought the 2 disk full soundtrack) I found this. Unfortunatly it is out of print. After buying it off of eBay I devoured it in a day and a half. Never in my life have I read a more hauntingly beautiful love story~! It is the tale of Erik (a.k.a Phantom of the Opera), whom was deformed at birth, as he lived his life full of hardships beyond imagination. It gives you a new perception of beauty because Erik is by far the most beautiful literary character I have ever seen (despite his deformation and warped imagination, which can be both beautiful and terrible). It makes you wish he were real so that you might wipe away his tears when he cries and you can almost hear him sing when he does in the book. A tale of sorrow, beauty, deceit, friendship, horror, imagination, love, you name it and this book has it. Just sit down in a comfortable spot, have a box of tissues handy, and your imagination run wild. Just make sure you start early unless you plan on reading throughout the night because it is near impossible to put this book down once you begin it! If you are a Phantom of the opera fan then this book is a must read. Enough said. \"None of us can choose where we will love.\" - ErikSusan Kay's bewitching novel, Phantom, is the story of the Phantom of the Opera, Erik, whose disfigurement frightens everyone around him and prevents him from being loved-even by his own mother. Phantom explains the darkness behind Erik's tortured soul better and more completely than the original novel by Gaston Leroux and the famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber.This beautifully written novel tells Erik's story, from his birth to his death. It begins in the point of view of Erik's mother, Madeleine, and describes how she hates and fears him from the day he was born and forces him to wear a mask. After Erik runs away from home, the story changes into Erik's perspective as he performs in a traveling gypsy circus. After the circus, the point of view changes once again to that of Giovanni, an Italian architect who takes Erik in and teaches him architecture. Following this, Erik travels to Persia, where his story is told by Nadir. Finally, Erik returns to France to help build the Op&eacute;ra Populaire, where he falls in love with a young singer, Christine...Kay's writing style is almost lyrical in its exceptionally detailed descriptions. The utter sincerity with which Erik's personality is written is astounding. Phantom is truly touching. Erik is such a powerful character, and through this wonderful retelling readers are able to understand the obscure depths of who he is and why he becomes the Phantom.Be prepared for angst, adventure, danger, romance, and self discovery when you pick up this remarkable book. Also, a note to parents: this book contains violence, drug use, and sexual content. While not explicit, this is definitely a young adult book at the least. I read this book when it was first published, and being a Phantom of the Opera fan, I loved it! The book explained so many of the reasons that Eric became the man he was...I read the book twice and loaned it out...and lost it. I'm so glad that it has been republished! Thanks for one of the best reads of my life!Eric's story will move you. His life was full of adventure, pain, and love. I could not put this book down once I started reading it. This 'biography' of the man made famous by everyone from Carl Lammele to Andrew Lloyd Weber is unabashedly romantic, even a touch melodramatic. But that is only fitting considering the source material.The great triumph of this book is how it weaves together such a variety of incident, from the provincial French town Eric's birth to Rome, Russia, and the court of a middle eastern potentate, and then inevitably back to the basement of the Paris Opera House, while making every step of the journey contribute to the climax that was imposed on the author by her sources. This could not have been easy, and it is quite something to see in action. I have been crazy about the Phantom since 1995.I went to see the musical and can play All the songs on the piano.Then came Kay's book,Phantom.I simply COULDN'T put it down for a second!I finished four hours after I got it. I recoiled from disgust at certain passages in the book and swore I'd never read it again.Three seconds later,I was at it again.Many parts were enjoyable,Erik certianly had a sense of humour. I give this book the highest marks. Susan Kay's outtake of the Phantom's tragic story is very good. I give the majority of the story five stars.However, I find a few problems, as well. For instance, Christine resembles, in this book, Erik's mother . . . unlikely, and Erik would have hated her if that were true, having read the first narrative in this book. And Erik becomes a drug addict in this book, a quite unlikely concept, especially with the drug used. Somewhat bad ending, in my opinion. Erik's supposed &quot;I'm an apprentice to Death&quot; in the end is awfully strange, I think. And after hearing Christine and Raoul chorus their love, his reaction is more of an &quot;I blame God&quot; than &quot;I blame Raoul&quot; and out of character. Yes, Susan Kay also got Erik out of character in plenty of parts. And what exactly is up with Charles?But if you can look past those several faults and the fact that the ending is worth about forty cents, you'll definitely want this book. Forget all the well meaning but amateurishly written fiction that has crossed over from zines to on demand publication, forget the original Leroux novel, forget any other Phantom fiction you have ever read. This is the real deal. This is Erik's story as it should be told.Ms. Kay takes Leroux's basics, adds in a generous dose of Michael Crawford's compassionate stage portrayal and produces a very real, very heart touching novel that tells us about Erik's life from birth through what happened in those fateful days in the Paris Opera House and beyond, how the story resolved itself after the ending of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.Erik's life is a tragedy. There is no way to change that. No pat happily ever after that takes the power of the story and makes it into something pedestrian. There is a sort of slice of happiness for Erik, not a large one but significant and a great hope for the future.I read this book in its original publication and I reread it periodically. The current edition is a bit pricey but it is definitely worth every cent of it. Kay is a good professional writer and her grasp of Erik's personality and his story is unparalleled. When I first read this book several years ago it was recommended to me by my girlfriend. I immediatly fell in love with it. I could not put it down until it was through reading. I was consumed by Kay's writing. It is poetry in literature. This is what books and novels should be. The story haunts me to this day. And of course I felt a special connection with Erik because my name is also Eric. I own three copies and am looking for more. After reading Leroux's book Phantom of the Opera and seeing various renditions on film of it (my favorite movie by far is the 2004 ALW version)I wanted, no desperately NEEDED, to know more about Erik and how he became the man he was. So to my utter joy and delight I discovered that someone had indeed written a book detailing Erik's early years right up to his meeting with Christine and even after they seperated.From the very first page until the last, I was totally engrossed in this heart wrenching novel. I couldn't put Phantom down! If it weren't for the fact that I had to go to work, eat, or feed my cats, I would have stayed enshrined in my home reading until I'd turned the last page.She has stayed faithful to the original characters, while adding a few of her own. She also captured the time in which Erik grew up extremely well. The prejudice toward anyone who looked different and the treatment of those very same people. How most with Erik's disfigurement were viewed with loathing, fear and contempt and considered monsters even if they had a good heart and never harmed a soul.Without giving to much away, she tells the story from different viewpoints using the first person vernacular: from his Mother, to Giovanni's (a master mason), to his, to the Persian, to his and Christine's and finally to Rauol's.There were quite a few times during my journey through Erik's life that I found tears streaming down my cheeks, finding them difficult to stem. Feeling so badly for him, wanting him to be happy, but knowing full well how it would end for him...IF she kept true to the Leroux's version. She does, but much to my delight she adds her own twist on this tragic tale. Reading those last few pages I found my cheeks drenched with tears and even as I write this I find my eyes misting over with how the book ended.Phantom is a MUST read for every POTO phan. A point of interest, and I add this for all feline lovers, Kay adds a delightful character in the form of a Siamese cat, who in my opinion has quite a bit of personality.So read the original version then read Phantom. You won't be disappointed! Utterly Phantastic. A beautiful book, I read it 6 or 7 years ago and read it at least once a year ever since until it was stolen. A more poignant lovestory was never written, even the tragedy of Shakespeare pales in comparison. I found myself so angry with so many characters, how could his mother do that to him?, how could anybody treat him so horribly? I commend Susan Kay for such an emotional heart-wrenching masterpiece. I grew especially fond of Erik's relationship with Ayesha and of Charles at the end of the book. Ms. Kay also managed to renew my faith in Christine a miracle in itself, considering how she is portrayed in Leroux's classic. BRAVO! This is a must read for any Phantom fan and definitely a keeper, do NOT borrow this book, BUY it!! If you're a phantom phan, then you'll LOVE this book! I am continually re-reading this book and I never get tired of it. I highly recommend this book.",

         "Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs",
         "I've often felt that Christian books on the subject of \"marriage\" are a dime a dozen. I've read through many that were helpful but often I've been left wondering where the biblical insights are! Not every \"Christian\" book on marriage should claim to be \"Christian\" if there is little appeal to the Scriptural position regarding the subject. How can a book be \"Christian\" if it does not interact or utilize the very book that Christianity is based upon that explains and reveals God's activity in redemption and the person whom our faith is founded upon?Thus, I'm delighted to recommend Dr. Emerson Eggerichs` book, Love & Respect. Eggerichs' thesis is largely based on Paul's words in Ephesians 5:22-25. The message is simple: Husbands, love your wives. Wives, honor your husbands.The book's first section deals with what Eggerichs calls, \"The Crazy Cycle.\" To simplify what the author writes in just over 100 pages, the \"crazy cycle\" deals with communication. Quite frankly, men and women communicate differently. And not only do they communicate differently, they decipher differently. When a spouse makes a statement that they innocently believe conveys their true feelings, the other spouse interprets it incorrectly and then responds to that misinterpretation. Thus, the \"crazy cycle\" begins. But those are simply symptoms of the greater issue at hand: men desire to be respected and wives desire to be loved. The messages often undermine these two foundational expressions.I believe Eggerichs touches on what generally is true of many married couples. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, or, in this case a psychologist, to recognize that communication is the issue. Since communication is the issue, what is the solution? This is where Eggerichs masterfully provides extremely practical insights and advice, and he does so with acronyms.As a husband, the key question is, how can I express love to my wife? Eggerichs suggests you become a better speller, spcifically that you learn to spell \"couple\" - C-O-U-P-L-E.Closeness - She wants to be close to youOpenness - She wants you to open up to herUnderstanding - Don't try to \"fix\" her; just listenPeacemaking - She wants you to say, \"I'm sorry\"Loyalty - She needs to know you're committedEsteem - She wants you to honor and cherish herThis is just a teaser. Each letter of the acronym has a chapter and each chapter is highly practical. I'd venture to guess that the \"C\" and the \"O\" are most often overlooked by many men, though each of the letters spark a great deal of insight into the mind of a women, specifically a wife.The essential truth is that if you work through the acronym, you end up at a place where your wife will know that you do honor and cherish her! I have personally learned quite a bit from this acronym.As we all know, wives are also in need of help expressing their honor, respect, and ultimately love for their husbands. Here, Eggerichs suggests they learn the word \"chair\" - C-H-A-I-R.Conquest - Appreciate his desire to work and achieveHierarchy - Appreciate his desire to protect and provideAuthority - Appreciate his desire to serve and to leadInsight - Appreciate his desire to analyze and counselRelationship - Appreciate his desire for shoulder-to-shoulder friendshipSexuality - Appreciate his desire for sexual intimacyAgain, this teaser does not give you a complete understanding of the practical ways to carry these out nor or the implications that go along with living it out. But they are there.The book closes with some thoughts on the rewards of living the suggestions out. In fact, I would buy this book for Eggerichs' chapter, \"The Real Reason to Love and Respect\" alone. It's about God. And it's about worship. This chapter is biblically and theologically rich. I'm reminded of the importance of taking to heart what matters to God, and marriage matters to God - period.Constructive Criticism: I only have one gripe with the book. I wish it would have taken into consideration the community and the function of the Church. The Church is a group of Jesus-followers that can greatly enhance a couple's marriage and I think this book relies a bit too much on the American individualism that often permeates our concept of \"community\" or \"church.\"For instance, what if a husband doesn't desire to protect and provide? What if a wife doesn't have a desire for her husband to apologize because she herself doesn't apologize? Eggerichs gives advice to the spouse trying to make change, but does the Church ever step in and bring correction and if so, how does that interact with the process of building a healthy marriage?I suppose these questions where not in the scope of the book, so my \"constructive criticism\" is based largely upon questions that I would really like to know Eggerichs' thoughts! After all, Eggerichs was a pastor and has an MDiv, which means I'm sure he's interacted with these ideas, specifically how the Church functions in the role of building strong marriages!Apart from these initial questions, I can only recommend this book for every married couple or couple planning to become married. It's fantastic. Read it, live it, and enjoy the benefits of it. So I've been reading this book for several weeks now (Love and Respect by Emerson Eggerichs) and honestly, it hasn't been easy.That's not necessarily because of the difficult nature of the subject matter, or it being something new and revolutionary to me....but that the author essentially takes Ephesians 5:33 and stretches it into 300 pages. It's taken me nearly two months to read it.This book is meant to be a book about improving your marriage, exploring the different ways that men and women communicate and how to best relate to each other. But it seemed more to me an advertisement for the Love and Respect conferences that Dr Eggerichs hosts. It is chock full of testimonials, and I half expected to see a button on the bottom of the pages asking me to \"Click here to find out more!!\" like you see for all those MLM websites and scams.That aside, the subject matter and central message of the book was not bad. Eggerichs takes Ephesians 5 (and other Bible passages) to propose the idea that while women most want to talk in a 'language of love' men think and respond best to a 'language of respect.' And that while women need unconditional love in a relationship, what men need most is unconditional respect.Now, I don't read marriage books. It's just not my thing. So I have no idea if this is a common idea that is thrown around, but it made a lot of sense to me. Many of the examples that were used in the book reminded me of events or conversations in my own life. Thankfully, things that used to happen long ago that are no longer a common occurrence.What made me take so long to read the book is that the information is pretty unbalanced. By that I mean he focuses most of the information towards the wife showing respect to her husband. He addressed this specifically in the book to be because he hears a far majority of the time that this is the 'new' part of the equation that people haven't heard before. Understandable. But after a while...it seems to be getting closer and closer to chauvinism or sexism.I don't know, there were some examples he was using and attitudes he was listing for how a wife should show respect to her husband that I just didn't quite jive with. And I'm no feminist or anything, by a long shot. But maybe it's just me.Anyway, Eggerichs has developed several illustrations and acronyms to help people find ways to apply his Love & Respect principle in their marriage, and though I personally find them a bit cheesy I can certainly appreciate how helpful they could be for people who wanted concrete, tangible ways to apply the basic point.I wouldn't really hesitate to recommend this book to people who were struggling in their relationship. It could turn out to be quite helpful, and to present the idea that men and women do hear/think/relate differently. And to be honest, I can't remember reading a better one...but I can't remember reading another one either, so there you go.I am a member of Thomas Nelson's Book Review Blogger program: [...] I was so sad when this book ended because I wanted to keep reading! This book is a must read and is hard to put down. It usually takes me about a week to read a book because I have many other things to do and I get easily side tracked. With this book I just wanted to keep reading and my ADD seemed to take a side step to how interesting this was. There were so many good points and many statements that were common sense that you simply wouldnt spend time thinking about and putting into action. Also, he is able to look at both sides of the equation and see where the woman is coming from in a situation and a man. There were many times where I was thinking, \"yea, but as a woman I dont think so!!!\" and then in the next sentence he would say how he knew that most women wouldnt see it that way because of the reasons that I was thinking. All in all it was just a great book! I don't usually write reviews on books because many other people can be so much more detailed. However, this book is so amazing I HAVE to rate it or I'll feel guilty!I have read a lot of books on marriage, and this is BY FAR the most practical, far-reaching one I have ever read. It has changed my relationship with my husband by changing the way I view almost every interaction between us.The best thing about this book (in my opinion) is that it only takes ONE spouse to start making a difference! In marriage, communication and conflict really are cycles where we react to each other, and even if only one of you reads this book, you WILL SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES by just trying out some of the ideas here. If both of you read the book, even better!!The book is set up so that there is a general section at the beginning, a few chapters \"for him\" specifically, and then a few chapters \"for her\" specifically. I found it helpful to read both sections (because sometimes we don't always fit the \"pink and blue\" stereotypes exactly; in our relationship I sometimes react the way the book says husbands more commonly do and vice versa) but they are definitely written for the audience. The men's chapters use examples men understand: circuitry, sports, etc. The women's chapters are written the way a woman understands.I love my husband deeply, and know that he loves me as well, so I could never understand why we would get into these terrible screaming matches over practically nothing. Things would get so bad I have wondered on more than one occasion if our marriage would last even with both of us intent that it would. It is simply amazing that on almost every page, there was a principle or an example or just a \"rephrasing\" of ideas that I have heard before, that were so profound to me that I felt like this book was written FOR ME.I would also like to add this: if you are not a very religious person, don't be intimidated. The principles and the referenced verses are Biblical, but the problems and the solutions are (again) practical and the author makes it very clear that this is backed up by secular research. The tone is helpful, sympathetic, and in NO WAY preachy.I cannot imagine this book NOT helping somebody, whether your marriage is already good and you want to make it better, or you are on the brink of divorce (like we were). I feel a deeper understanding of how to show love to my husband, and I am receiving more love from him in response than I have since we were dating! Don't bother with the library - you will not regret buying this book! :o) I love the message that God has given Dr. Eggerichs! This teaching is so simple, has been overlooked by many but yet tremendously powerful. It is so on point and can turn a bad marriage to good and a so-so marriage to WONDERFUL! My husband and I were taking the seminar at our church and we decided to buy the book. What Dr. Eggerichs revealed about men and women and marriage brought on a whole new understanding.I read some of the posts below and it is unfortunate that women can sit in a room and focus on how the man is the problem in their marriage without once even looking at themselves but cannot sit under the instruction of a Godly man and be told the truth! Feminist will hate this book, but a humble Godly woman will find the treasures and see her marriage soar to the highest level. I am a living witness and yes I am a woman!I suggest this book for any married couple or couples who are thinking of getting married. Once again the perfect example of if Women would be more needy then men would love us more.I bought this book for a 14 hour plane trip. It was one of the few things that caught my eye in the airport store. I finally decided that I would rather read the vomit bag. That was at least useful.I just sat there thinking, It is not wrong for me to be financially independent from my husband. That is not disrespectful to him. If he takes it that way, then his ego is the problem. Not anything that I have done.I need/want my husband because we are equals.What happened to thinking that we were grown-ups and that we could treat each other that way? I have no use for these mind games.Yes love & respect each other. But don't force it. Don't change who you are.God gave both men & women brains to avoid this type of right wing preaching. Besides the Bible, this is probably the best book written on male/female specific sources of conflict. It clearly and simply explains the most common reasons for conflict and how they can be avoided. It opened my eyes to life changing truths that had always been cloudy to me. A must read for all adults, Christian or not! \"Love & Respect\"By: Dr. Emerson Eggerichs...\"The Love she Most Desires\"...\"The Respect He Desperately Needs\"...I was so truly excited to be offered the book, \"Love & Respect\" to read and review, but after reading it, my first and foremost reaction to it was a big \"WOW!!! And...I don't mean that in the most positive way, either. I was very disappointed in Dr. Eggerichs' book. I am not sure if I just expected more of it, especially since I knew of others who had read & raved about it. But...I was only let down by the \"sexism\" in the book, and how some scripture was taken out of context. I am all for men to be treated as \"King of the Castle\", but they should not be so dominant, that the woman feels less equal. To me, this certainly was portrayed, over and over, throughout the book. If anyone knows me & my husband, they know that I believe in treating him with the \"utmost\" of respect; having his meals ready for him when he walks in the door, keeping his home clean for him, schooling the children, the list really goes on and on...but this does not imply that either of us believes that I should feel less of a person than him. This is exactly how Dr. Eggerichs' book made me feel, from cover to cover, for the most part.On a side note, I do applaud him for what I read on page 182...this was one portion of the book, that seemed to all but briefly, \"lift wives up\"...\"esteem\" them, was the word he used.\"Your Wife Will Feel Esteemed When...\"* \"you say, \"I'm so proud of the way you handled that.\"* \"you speak highly of her in front of others.\"* \"you open the door for her.\"* \"you try something new with her.\"* \"you give her encouragement or praise with kindness and enthusiasm.\"* \"you notice something different about her hair or clothes.\"* \"you are physically affectionate with her in public.\"* \"you teach the children to show her and others respect.\"* \"you value her opinion in the gray areas as not wrong but just different-and valid.\"* \"you choose family outings over \"guy things\".\"* \"you make her feel first in importance.\"* \"you are proud of her and all she does.\"If only this book was more equal throughout in passages, such as the one quoted from it above, I think it would have been a more well-rounded book for couples to share and grow together from. With it being written in such a \"chauvinist\" manner, I know that it is not a book that my husband and I would ever relate to, or desire to use as a reference or teaching source. Thankfully, our book of choice for teaching us is the BIBLE, God's word...nothing else needs to be said, on our part. I believe that this book may be helpful to some, but it just was not \"my cup of tea\".As per FTC guidelines, I must state that I was given a review copy of the book, \"Love & Respect\" from Thomas Nelson Publisher's to read for review. My opinions are expressly my own, and are in no way made positively or negatively, due to receiving a review copy. All married couples can benefit from reading Love and Respect. In this book, Dr. Eggerichs shares a simple but complex secret to a long and happy marriage: when a husband loves his wife, then his wife will respect him. This secret, first shared by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 5, is easier said than done because the opposite is also true: when a husband is unloving toward his wife, then she reacts in ways that her husband feels is disrespectful, then he becomes more unloving, and she becomes more disrespectful: they get into what is called the \"Crazy Cycle\" and round-and-round they go. Dr. Eggerichs shares practical advice for getting off the crazy cycle and starting to live life to the fullest on the \"Energizing Cycle.\"Through everyday examples backed up by Biblical truths, Dr. Eggerichs shares that these basic needs - love and respect - can be met through self-less communication and actions by both the husband and the wife. These practical practices form two easy to remember acrostics C-O-U-P-L-E-S and C-H-A-I-R-S that can work if you do the work: Emerson shares how these self-less truths have turned bad marriages into good ones and good marriages into great ones. In part 3 of the book, \"The Rewarded Cycle,\" Eggerichs' most important point is this: your marriage really has nothing to do with your spouse, but has everything to do with your relationship to Christ. When you look at it that way, your loving and respectful marriage also deepens your love and reverence for God, and then the rewards are innumerable! [...] This book is full of great information on the differences between men and women and their vastly different needs and perspectives. I'd recommend it as a must-read for all who want to improve communication and understand their spouses. It puts the roles of husband and wife in a new perspective...it's a must read! It has taught me a lot about how to view my husband's role in the home and how he feels. At times men won't say how they feel...I love this book!! After reading the sample book, I had to have it. We've been using Love and Respect to structure the discussions we have in our Couples' Ministry classes (www.familycogic.org). While our discussions have always been lively, the book reveals God's answers to questions couples have had since Adam and Eve from the Bible:+ Why is our marriage so crazy sometimes?+ How do we stop \"the crazy cycle\"?+ Why doesn't my wife respect me?+ Why doesn't my husband love me?+ How can I get my spouse to love or respect me more?+ How can we ensure continued growth in our love and respect for each other?I needed this book. We were destined to keep spinning in \"the crazy cycle\", it seemed, and I was powerless to stop it. The book gave me the tools I needed to stop the spinning and help us get on a course toward a more mutually fulfilling marriage.Student pilots learn how to recover from spins in all sorts of aircraft. They do this by making the plane spin, and then doing the steps (some of which wouldn't seem to make sense) to get back into controlled flight.Life sometimes causes us to spin out of control. In the way that a instructor pilot helps his student, Dr. Eggerichs coaches us in the steps for recovering from the spinning of \"the crazy cycle\", and challenges us to press toward the mark of the high calling God has given us as husbands and wives. Our marraige counselor recommended this book and I so glad she did. It made a huge impact on our relationship. It helped to see a better way to show my husband that I love him. And his reaction to me has been amazing. We just communicate a lot better now because this book helped us understand eachother better. WOW! This books chapters on respecting your husband are brilliant and unique.This and The Five Love Languages are my two favorites. This book made me laugh and cry and really opened my eyes. I am a father of three married for 14 years and I have been trying the whole time to understand the concept of biblical manhood (i.e. Father, Husband, and Laborer). When the author, using lots of scripture and psychology to back up his arguments, explained to a woman how to treat her man he also taught me what the \"Biblical Man\" was.The chapter on sex is the first time I have ever had anyone secular or Christian properly addresses what sex is to a man and how a woman should treat her husband in that area. How many married men have talked to me about their struggles with their wives in this area and the answer is right here. I am considering emailing anonymously the sex chapter to every married woman I know.Gals, if you want a happy husband who WANTS to treat you right read the \"How to respect your husband chapters\".NEGITIVES: I can't promote the how to love your wife chapters. They were not really unique and The Five Love Languages book by Gary covers the loving your wife thing better. Also, the \"Crazy cycles\" and all that are just another popular psychology gimmick I have seen better and worse in that department. But please don't be discouraged.Let me say clearly that if you buy the book only for the \"How to respect your husband\" chapters it was money very well spent. I bought this book when I was trying to make changes in my approach and treatment of my husband. This book has really opened my eyes from a Godly perspective, and I recommend this for marriages both who are already succeeding and joyful, and those marriages that are in trouble. Completely worth the cost, and you will definitely find when you really think about things, and make the simple changes, the huge difference you will see in your husband or wife. You won't be disappointed. This book changed my marriage. A friend of mine had given it to me as a hostess gift. As I read it, it made a remarkable impact! I shed many tears knowing it was talking right to me, I put it into practice immediately and the improvement in my marriage was overnight! Now my husband is reading it too. I thank God my friend brought it to me. I knew I needed to pass it on and so I ordered the book for our church library. Emerson Eggrichs clearly states in his notes in the back of the book, that it is important to make a distinction between theology and theory. He goes on to distinguish that `The Love and Respect Connection' is his theory in which he infers from Ephesians 5:33.It seems that Mr. Eggrichs is pitting spouses against each other by pointing out how different men and women are and using many derogatory statements about what women are thinking about men and vise versa. Thus creating separation rather than unity . . . you know, `and the two shall become one.' My husband agrees that Emerson Eggrichs seems to grind spouses against each other like sandpaper rather than bringing them together in unity.Mr. Eggrichs quotes John Gottman, a renowned and well-respected University of Washington psychology professor. However, he fails to keep the context of the studies by omitting John Gottman's scientific research to include `mutual' love and respect. Direct quotes from John Gottman's books:\"No matter what style of marriage they have adopted, their discussions, for the most part, are carried along by a strong undercurrent of two basic ingredients: love and respect. These are the direct opposite of - and antidote for- contempt, perhaps the most corrosive force in marriage. But all the ways partners show each other love and respect also ensure that the positive-to-negative ratio of a marriage will be heavily tilted to the positive side.\" . . . \"By this I mean a mutual respect for and enjoyment of each other's company.\" . . . \"They don't just \"get along\"- they also support each other's hopes and aspirations and build a sense of purpose into their lives together. That is really what I mean when I talk about honoring and respecting each other.\" \"...you need to understand the bottom-line difference that is causing the conflict between you-and to learn how to live with it by honoring and respecting each other.\" (Reference John Gottman's books `Why Marriages Succeed or Fail' pages 61 and 62 as well as `The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work' pages 19, 23 and 24.)I do not recommend that you spend your time or energy on this nauseatingly repetitive book when there are so many good books to choose from that can actually help create harmony in your marriage. We're going through Love and Respect with 4 couples, all early in our marriages, and have found great insights into each other's thoughts and feelings. My husband and I are communicating better and getting along more than we have in a while. My only problem is that this copy is in large print, which I did not notice at all in its review when ordering. Excellent book. I have read many other books on the same topic and this is among the very best. Presents important principles in a simple and easy to understand fashion. Good for both husband and wife - in fact, should be read together. This book is for the 1st time marriage to the 50th Anniversary marriages! We have learned how to not step on one anothers air hoses, breathing and living a better marriage. We both wished we could have read this book 22 years ago!I have also sent one to my sister, in hopes it will help out her marriage as much as it helped out us! This book was reccomended to me by someone and I am SOOO happy I bought this book! Even though I have only read one chapter so far, the introduction absolutely was mind boggling and made me stand up and say AHHH HAA! If you want to understand why so many relationships have communication problems and have disaggrements read this book. Its as simple as the cycle he explains from not only a Christian perspective but a psychological one as well. Open perspective allows you to self reflect and grow to have that relationship you so desire! Great READ!! No matter how good your marriage is--you will learn something helpful from this book! I have never read a more realistic book on marriage or its real issues. Every woman wants to be loved unconditionally--no matter how bad her day or mood is, she still wants her man to love her inspite of the way she comes across. Every man wants to be respected unconditionally even after he makes mistakes or has comes across in a \"less than perfect\" manner. Emerson helps both husband and wife be able to meet these deep and basic needs in each other. The result is a loving and pleasant marriage and home. Not only does Emerson clearly articulate our marriage problems and issues, but he has a simple and easily understood solution. He does this in such a way that even after you lay the book down you will still remember what it said and how to apply it to your life. It doesn't get better than this. Read it today! Emerson Eggerichs suggests that men and women frequently fail to provide one another with what both require most - men don't seem to know how to demonstrate their love in marriage while women seem clueless about showing respect. Enough testimonials from married couples affirm that the consequence of this reciprocal neglect is often an endless cycle of bitter behavior. Eggerichs asks partners to stop the cycle by supplying their mates with the absent attribute. I agree that this is an inherent blind spot to the respective genders; and consequently, an achilles heel in most marriages. Every married couple would be helped by reading this book. I just finished this book, and am impressed with the simplicity of this message. The Pink/Blue sunglasses & hearingaids clear up things in a way that no one else has come up with.I recently had read Ken Nair's books, and felt beat up.I finished this book and felt built up!It gave me the tools and the courage to keep trying in my marriage. Good book for married couples or individuals wanting to understand and gain insight in how the opposite sex feels and is made up. Would highly recommend this book. I have always loved my wife but I haven't always been able to show that to her. This book helped me to better understand to react to her in a way that promotes solving problems rather than causing them continue. More importantly it helped her to be more respectful. She had always complained we weren't able to communicate well and this book helped her learn to decode the things I had always wanted to tell her. She has become very proficient at expressing her feelings in a way that is respectful and makes me want to show her love. Occasionally I'll still be unloving or she will be disrespectful, but this book has shown us how to stop it there instead of allowing it to escalate. It is a truly wonderful book to work through with you wife. I would encourage every married couple to read it. No book other than the bible itself has helped my wife and I more than this one. Simple, yet profoundly helpful and relevant for any marriage. Paul exhorted husbands to unconditionally love their wives and wives to unconditionally respect their husbands. This is the needed clarity that every marriage needs to fulfill their God-given purposes and experience true and lasting joy. I can't wait to go through the video series. So, I've been reading Love and Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs this week, and, to be fair, his premise is great. Working from Ephesians 5:33, Eggerichs argues that women need love and men need respect and that the amount of love and respect in a marriage will determine it's success or failure.Eggerichs goes with the \"respect\" translation here instead of \"submission,\" a decision that, I think, eventually weakens his case. It's very possible for a woman to submit to a man who often disappoints her, but much harder for a woman to respect that man. She can act respectfully...Anyway, I agree with Eggerichs that men need to be valued and admired and treated with respect. I also agree that women need to be loved. I wonder though if men do really prefer respect to love. My husband said he didn't think that was true for him (which really undercuts the value of my reading the book) and my preacher said from the pulpit the other night that he'd prefer to be loved than respected. That's certainly not exhaustive research, but it makes me wonder.Overall, I think this book fails to execute on an excellent idea primarily because of what seems like a serious bias against women. I posted this possibility on facebook and quickly heard from multiple women who felt the same way. For example, at one point Eggerichs advises men: \"Be willing to take a hit from your wife. You won't die (although at times death may seem preferable).\" Similarly, throughout the book he casts women as \"usually the ones who are criticizers\" and men as unwitting victims, at worst fools.Eggerichs tells a story about a man who buys his wife a birthday card for their anniversary and very obviously defends the husband. He even says the wife is \"assassinating his character\" when she suggests that he might love his car more he loves her--a car he obsesses over in detail. I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. That guy had it coming. And, maybe I'm crazy, but a statement of fact doesn't seem like a character assassination.My other major criticism is that much of the book reads like an advertisement for itself, regularly citing letters from fans that often seem out of place.Also, the writing's not so great. Some metaphors just seem very forced (pink and blue hearing aids, deer trampling love tank air hoses...).Having said all of that, I still think a book on this topic is important. Women do need to understand how much men need respect (or submission) and men do need a reminder that their wives need love. I just think a more balanced, more skillful presentation is in order. I am reading this book as part of my pre martial courses and really have enjoyed the book. I suggest that anyone having a problem in their marriage reading this.book and also anyone getting married read it too! My husband was told this was an exceptional book. He asked that we read it and out of respect for him I did. Every. Last. Page. My husband and I must be the exception mentioned briefly. We don't match up to any of the stereotypes the author uses.My biggest problem is with the concept that my husband should make all the decisions and that if I disagree with him I should be respectfully quiet. My husband has insight that I as a woman could never have. I should defer to him because God made him in His own image. I however was made in the image of man and therefore lesser.When you take out the pleasant words it boils down to . \"Keep your stupid female mouth shut and if your unhappy it's all your own fault.\" Very nice. If this is the model for a Christian marriage I just won't be a Christian. My husband and I read through this book together, and instantly realized that it got to the heart of the things we've been arguing about since we got married more than 10 years ago. Truely, it gets to the heart of communication between a married couple in a way that no other book does...of course practicing what it teaches is always hard work. We led a 10 week class based on this book at our church with 22 couples in attendance. They all remarked that the principles in this book were life-changing for their marriage. In teaching it, we also found that we had to face up to the tough issues in our marriage which we had been avoiding for 10 years. Once we discussed them, they really weren't as difficult as we thought and we reached a new level of understanding one another. I highly recommend this book to couples who want an excellent marriage, as well as those who are struggling. Gave this book to 2 people as gifts and they said it's a big eyeopener. They are still reading it but thus far they find it very helpful! Maybe this book isn't the first one out there to focus on the \"respect he needs\" and the \"love she desires,\" but this book definitely puts a new spin on the idea that I haven't seen anywhere else.Dr. Eggerichs puts into words what I and other men I know haven't been able to articulate, but it all rings true. I've heard a similar response from women readers. I've read dozens of relationship texts over the years and this is, by far, the most insightful and practical text I have come across. Dr. Eggerichs uses one verse from the Bible and demonstrates how simple the idea of love and respect is. In practicality, marriage isn't easy, but if you're seeking wise, straightforward, and understandable advice, then check this one out.You'll hear this throughout the book: \"not wrong, just different.\" This book is different than the rest, and definitely not wrong. Even though its difficult to swallow, there were a lot of great truths in this book. And when I can actually kill my pride enough to follow the much needed advice to stay off the crazy cycle, my relationship hums right along. Next task is to get the hubby to read it! This book is my new wedding gift for all couples. It was very real & insightful. Not brain surgery by far, but an excellent resource and a very easy read. I ended up purchasing the audio version, just because I was so \"hungry\" that I couldn't get through it fast enough. The book Love and Respect by Emerson Eggerichs is a book that gives marriage a chance. Marriage is something is unity between two people. However more specifically marriage is the unity between two fallen people. Since this is a unity between two fallen people this is an explanation of why there is a need for marriage counseling and the increase of divorce rates. People have struggles of their own due to their fallen sin nature, but when one pairs that with another person who has struggles of their own, this will result in disagreements. This book explains that even though one has struggles of their own, it is about loving the other person unconditionally along with many other eye-opening aspects.The book Love and Respect is a biblical supported book on some counseling aspect regarding marriage. This book helps to empathize that in a marriage even thought there are struggles because each person is a fallen person, there is still hope for the marriage. The hope is the hope of Jesus Christ. He is the one that lead the way to show what forgiveness is. Jesus is the model that we are to follow, not just for our lives but also to understand how to treat others.The book begins by stating that as the marriage begins, there may be tiny disagreements within the marriage because these two fallen people are trying to live together. In the beginning both the people within the marriage believe that love would be enough. According to Eggerichs:You may remember how the Beatles sang, \"All you need is love.\" I absolutely disagree with that conclusion. Five out of ten marriages today are ending in divorce because love alone is not enough. Yes, love is vital, especially for the wife, but what we have missed is the husband's need for respect. This book is about how the wife can fulfill her need to be loved by giving her husband what he needs-respect.This book shows one the way that love is a component to marriage but it is not the only component.I believe that anyone who is single, engaged, newlywed or married many years should read this book. This book has the infallible Word of God as the main support for this book. This book helps the reader to use the word of God to guide their marriage. It is also full of the underlying belief and truth that women crave love and men crave respect. If both these needs are met, love and respect, then more than likely the marriage will endure any storm it faces. I believe above all each member in the marriage must love another unconditionally, Christ died for them too!(Written by Joy Mays)Final Note: Many struggling couples have been helped through online counseling, and telephone counseling. I have found this clinical guide to be very helpful to persons wanting to learn how to provide Online Counseling:The Therapist's Clinical Guide to Online Counseling and Telephone Counseling: The Definitive Training Guide for Clinical Practice A close friend recommended us to read the book and the contents of the book has indeed lived up to its title. It is not just a fancy title to catch attention but the solid principles on male and female relationships particularly in a committed marriage is so very important and relevent for couples all over the world today. This is one book that we say is a MUST BUY and a MUST READ. Ephesians 5:33 (NIV) states: \"However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\" I think most of us GET the \"love\" part; yet tend to overlook the \"respect\" part. In his book, Dr. Eggerichs unpacks this verse for us with plenty of personal stories, scientific studies on gender differences, and additional scripture. Eggerichs explains and illustrates the impact of this verse on relationships with what he calls the \"Crazy Cycle\" - that a man needs respect to show a woman love and a woman needs love to show the man respect and when that chain gets broken somewhere along the way, we end up in the \"crazy cycle\" of the husband feeling disrespected and the wife feeling unloved. Fortunately, Eggerichs gives very real, very practical examples of how to break free of this doomed pattern.\"Love & Respect\" certainly challenged me, inspired me (and most of all, instructed me!) in how to be a better wife. I also know that even if my husband never reads this book, he will be a better husband because of how I treat him (and how God intervenes!). So whether you are thinking about getting married, hope one day to get married, have been married for 1 year or 50 years, I think there is something in this book for you!-Katie CaseyThomas Nelson Book Review Blogger[...] Title: Love & RespectAuthor: Dr. Emerson EggerichsRating: GoodReason for Reading: I received this book through Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program.Summary: The book is based on Eggerichs' research on Ephesians 5:33, where the apostle Paul commands husbands to love their wives and wives to respect their husbands. Rather than merely focusing on the importance of unconditional love, the book adds the counterbalance of the need for unconditional respect, specifically for men. Eggerichs details how all throughout scripture, from his years of marital counseling, his parents' marriage, and his own marriage, this principle of wives needing unconditional love and husbands needing unconditional respect works.The author describes three cycles, starting with The Crazy Cycle, where a wife's disrespectful attitude towards her husband causes him to be have an unloving attitude towards her, or vice versa, and the cycle repeats. But, there is also the Energizing Cycle, where a wife's respect or husband's love motivates the other. And ultimately, there is the Rewarded Cycle, where a wife's respect or husband's love is offered regardless of their spouse's behavior, but as a sign of reverence for Christ.Review: I found this book to be an exceptional treatise on marriage, based on both scripture and the author's personal experience, of how men and women are different, speaking different languages and responding to different emotions, but are beautifully designed to work together. There is a ton of valuable insight into why you think and feel the way you do, why your spouse thinks and feels differently, and how to better understand these dynamics to improve your marriage. If you don't understand why you and your spouse are different, and how to deal with it, this is a must read. If you want your marriage to be an example for your children and your community, this is a must read.DevonOther resources: [...]Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 [...] : \"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\" I've been engaged for a few months and I prayed to God to deliver me from some serious anger issues I had only when dealing with my soon to be husband. I struggled giving up my independence and I realized that fear played a big role in my anger as well as a lack of respect for this beautiful person in my life. Well God answered my prayers by leading me to this spiritually sound book and this has totally changed my relationship. The anger is gone and I give my fiance all the respect he deserves. He was already showing me so much love but I didn't know how to accept it but while reading this book I realized that he was loving me through his faith in God because he truly could see that I was a beautiful person under all that anger I expressed. I've read many books on anger and I also seek counseling but nothing has changed my life and delivered me from the anger in my relationship like this book. I purchased this book believing the DVD was included because of the add listing. When I opened the package and the book the DVD was no where to be found. I am very disappointed and feel cheated. I will not rcommend this site amy longer. I absolutely LOVE this book! My mother always taught me that men need respect as badly as women need love- so this was not a new concept for me. However, I really was intrigued because there just are not enough books about there that give advice on how to better understand this and how to be more respectful. It was so interesting to learn more about the opposite sex and how their minds work. I would recommend this book for everyone. I'm so glad I read this book before getting married because I feel like I can prevent the crazy cycle from ever starting. I bought this book for a friend from church to help in her relationship with her boyfriend. She's has started reading the book and it very grateful for the help she's attaining from this book. If your serious about working on your marrage this information can help. It is not the.same old stuff about how the husband is a bozzo and needs to learn how to be more caring. It give both husband and wife constructive help. I read LOVE AND RESPECT thinking that there wasn't much new for me to learn in it. I have been married for thirty-one years, and I have read a LOT of books on marriage. This one has a different focus, though, that being on wives respecting their husbands and husbands loving their wives. In a society that I think tends to belittle men, I thought that was a message worth sharing.There's a statement in the book that says,\"...being nice doesn't work. Disrespect gets attention.\" Is that the level our society has reached? And if so, how has it damaged relationships like marriage?Basing his message on Ephesians 5:33, Dr. Eggerichs puts a lot of emphasis on what wives can do to show their husbands respect, and he addresses how husbands should love their wives as well. He gives acronyms to help couples remember what their mates desire, and he even includes appendices with suggestions about what to think, do and say to practice love and respect in your marriage. Everything in his book may not be new to you, but I bet that if you read it, you will come away with something you can try to make your marriage stronger. This book helped transform my marriage! My husband and I love it. We suggest it to everyone we know. If you want to refresh your marriage or \"go back to the basics,\" this is the book that will put you dating all over again...maybe for the first time in your life! It will open a whole new door for you and your spouse to communicate. It will teach you some of the biggest mistakes you may not realize you are making and show you how to fix them. Love and Respect will transform your thought life, your actions and will make you stop and ask yourself what your true motivations are. This book is only for those who are serious about taking a good look at themselves - it is NOT for those who are in it to \"fix\" their spouse. I haven't read the entire book yet, but I'm already getting excited about using it as a resource in my practice. The title alone says so much about what this book is about --- and the pages within are chock full of ideas to help make a marriage more functional. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond This is a great book based on what is most important to men and women in marriage. This is about traditional values of trying to make a marriage work by making your spouse's needs your priority. I would not recommend it for people who are in abusive verbal, emotional or physical relationships. This is for people who have a basically good person they're married to, but it seems that they cannot connect. Awesome book! I have been married 16 years and have counseled several couples on marriage. I have couples in my life that have been married from 25 to 54 years that have not offered such simple,sound and challenging advice ever as thsi book has.I selected this book based on the number of reviews it had, know I see why. My wife and I live for the energizing cycle and try to recgonize when the crazy cycle begins. I purchased this series for my husband and I. But once I listened to all the CD's I had to share it with friends! My husband was serving overseas at the time, but I was eager for him to hear it as well. When the kids and I got a chance to visit him, I brought this CD series. My husband introduced me to some of the great couples he had met there - and we all met one night and listened to a few of the CD's. IT WAS GREAT! One couple shared that this helped to save their marriage - so we bought them one for their anniversary! I do recommend this CD series! The only draw back to me - is that there are so many CD's, and if you are a busy person like me - you may need several occassions to listen to the whole set! This book is a must have for every woman that wants God's love to flow into her relationships!So many of us struggle within our marriages trying to love others based on what we personally like.God calls us to LOVE others, but as wives-Dr. Emerson points out that LOVE for our husbands comes in the form of RESPECT-thus God's COMMANDED TO RESPECT husbands, and our husbands, TO LOVE US! If this is the way God ORDAINED IT, this is the ONLY WAY TO HEALTHY AND FRUITFUL MARRIAGES!Lets face it, we aren't always LOVEABLE, and even less so if we're expecting our husbands to thrive on LOVE without respect. Most wives I know deem themselves bossy, and thier husbands push overs-what shall we expect when we're treating them unBiblically-expecting our needs to be met without giving them theirs. To RECEIVE, we must be willing to give-you know, the \"sowing and reaping\" aspect of everything that God has ordained-that He has promised.We can't possibly receive love without GIVInG RESPECT; so especially when they voice their opinions we are to trust God and respect their decision. Otherwise, if we don't give support and respect, THEY GIVE UP! THIS BOOK HELPS COUPLES TO REDIRECT THIER MISUNDERSTOOD LOVE-REPECT GIVING/TAKING in a relationship AND ALLOWS GOD TO COME IN AND TRANSFORM MARRIAGES & RESTORE NEW-FOUND LOVE AGAIN, back to the honey-moon phase as WE OBEY GOD'S WORD, applying these principles as he outlines them in his book.Well done, buy one for every engaged and married couple, that we'll have a new generation of Biblically founded relationships and marriages that will be strong, not struggling, by finally letting husbands make the choices, and leading their families without friction, with us wives submitting respectfully>>AS GOD INTENDED!TAMMY M PRICE/AUTHOR:Alphabet Prayers: The Power of Praying Scripture into the Hearts You Love40 Day Journey to the Heart of GodPRAYING GOD'S WORD for the WORLD-Lighting Pathways of Blessing! I appreciated the premise of the book. However, if you've read the introduction and first chapter you've read the whole thing. The rest of the book is simply a restatement of the premise. Not a lot of practical info. Wait for the movie... Despite my recoiling against his religious basis, and my discomfort at what I see as his mis-attribution of what are clearly scientific causes to \"god and the bible\" -- I found his book to be absolutely *excellent*, and I recommend it eagerly to everyone I know. Despite having studied and read and counseled many women and couples, my eyes were opened when Eggerichs presented the unfound key to intersex relationships: it's not love for both members in the couple: it's love for women and *respect* for men that is the basis of a solid relationship. His metaphor of pink and blue glasses, hearing aids, and megaphone is an excellent shorthand for what I have tried to get both sexes to understand. (Deborah Tannen in her excellent books describes it as men and women speaking different languages despite it sounding like they're using the same words. Dr. Pat Allen, in her books and seminars, teaches that when a man is respected by his partner, he feels cherished, and when a woman is cherished by her partner, she feels respected -- because each has a different underlying need: for a woman to cherish a man's feelings is mommying him, and for a man to respect a woman is masculinizing her.)Emerson's communication template: (him:) \"what you said sounded disrespectful, was I unloving?\" and (her:) \"what you said sounded unloving, was I disrespectful?\" as a way to respond instead of knee-jerk defensiveness (or rather, after controlling one's natural knee-jerk defensiveness {wink}) allows fighting, angry, or unhappy couples to change the dynamics of their interactions, in a way that recalls their love and good-hearted connection to each other.Amazing amazing book. Never has anyone put so clearly the 2 roles for women and men. This has so helped me understand the differences between my husband and myself. It has clearly helped us help other couples, even our own adult children!I highly recommend this book for any couples that want to understand and change the insane cycles that torment our marriages! Since I live in Brazil, the translation in Portuguese has been another tremendous tool to help couples in their marriages! This is one of the better \"he needs, she needs\" books. There are a lot of them right now;but this one rises above most with helpful, insightful analysis.What takes this book beyond \"Love and Respect\" is the specific, how-to informationabout meeting each other's needs as a couple. You'll laugh, you'll learn, andyou'll find yourselves in these pages.Well-written and definitely worth the read!Barbara Sheldon, M.S.W.I also highly recommend: The Soul-Mate Marriage: The Spiritual Journey of Becoming One This book was recommended to me by my boyfriend (can't imagine why... ;) and it's been incredibly eye-opening not just in how I relate to him but even to my dad. In the past, I thought my dad was prone to moodiness and reacted strongly to things that seemed very minor. Since reading the book, I've realized my dad was responding to disrespectful attitudes or actions in my mom, sister or me. Likewise with my boyfriend, when he may seem to \"stonewall\", I now know to politely ask if I did or said something that came across as disrespectful (to not assume it's without cause).Reading the book was hard and very humbling at times, but it is very in line with scripture and has been a great source of wisdom. I am learning to pray for God's help and for His humble heart in me so I can live out His commands in Ephesians 4 as well: \"As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\"I highly recommend it and am already planning to order more copies as wedding gifts for friends and family! We've been married 43 years. Wish we had this book 40 years ago. This should be required reading for every married couple. Having been through almost a year of marriage counseling after 25+ years of marriage this book helped me as a man. It is balanced. I don't think other reviewers are being fair when they state that Emerson was saying men were (more) honorable in shutting down and walking away. If a person closely reads the book they will see that is not the case...the author is only describing a scenario that starts the 'crazy cycle.' I found it helpful advice that he tells the reader (either man or woman) to stop trying to 'fix' their mate. Instead we can only through God's grace work on our own brokenness. Emerson also does not fall into the psychological analysis trap even though he has a PhD in that discipline. He first goes to the Apostle Paul and exegetes from there to our modern marriages. I think he also has some insights to answer some Christian women who say about Paul in I Corinthians 7 and Ephesians 5 that these scriptures 'don't apply to modern culture' as Paul was a man and he could never understand what it is like to be a woman. His answers may anger some but I encourage readers to finish the entire book before they try to make judgement. Highly recommended. I had a hard time getting through this book, but I kept pludging through it because I reallly wanted to learn something new. I'm not sure if it's because the author believes the \"only the love message is taught in churches and we don't hear much about respect,\" but the majority (75% of the book) is on wives respecting their husbands. The majority of the written letters/of praise reports is women who write in saying how much they never got the concept of respect and it saved their marraige. These letters are from women who were literally physically abused by their husbands, or cheated on, writing to say that that because they've practiced respect no matter what their husband was doing to them, it miraculously made everything better.I'm all for respect, as in kindess. But the author goes deep into a concept called undconditional respect. He takes scripture and sort of implies what it does not say. He says that if God calls husbands to LOVE their wives unconditionally, then he must also command wives to RESPECt their husbands unconditionally too, right? The equation doesn't go for me. Every man deserves kindess, to be treated nicely and not put down, but to me I continue seeing respect as an honorable thing that is earned. The murderer, rapist, wife-beater down the street.... I would not show respect. I would show kindess, yes. But respectable men demand respect by their actions, by their heart. Any person who chooses to demand respect regardless of what they do is self-centered, regardless of gender.Maybe it would make it easier to understand, if the author actually defined respect. Which he really, does not. Most of the examples of \"disrespect\" he shows are of women bickering & verbally abusing their husband. So I'm assuming that by repect, he's meaning to show kindess and not say anything mean or deroggatory and smiling and loving your husband. But he doesn't make any of this clear. He mainly shows bad examples of women who don't respect their husband. Throughout all this I get the gist that perhaps this man, like many others, has had very bad experiences with his wife being verbally abusing and flat out \"mean\" to him all the time. This isn't the case in all marriages, but he makes it seem like it's universal.He also claims that men don't need love so much as they do respect. Love is for girls. Respect is for boys. When I asked my husband about this he said, he needs both. He said he doesn't so much notice his need for respect but he thinks I do pretty good job at it. (I was pleasantly surprised...as I'm not perfect. :o) I don't like the way he makes love seem like it's only for women. Men need to be loved as well. You can love them by respecting them, but they still need love.This book may ring more true for couples who are really struggling with respecting one another (man & woman) but for me, the books seems quite redundant and one sided. Not quite what I expected. This book is amazing - and revealed to me so many things I never knew. I think the facts and principles in this book (taken straight from the Bible) could save any marriage. It's really a simple message - a wife has an incredible need to be loved unconditionally, and a husband has an incredible need to feel respected unconditionally. When a spouse is willing to meet the deepest need of their spouse, the craziness stops, and a true, loving relationship can flourish. This message is based on Ephesians 5:33.Applying these principles is not easy; it does not come naturally to men to love unconditionally, nor does it come naturally to women to respect unconditionally. The unconditional part is so hard to put into action - it means \"no matter what.\" This is played over and over again in marriages all around you - a woman makes an unsavory comment about her husband to her friends or corrects him in front of others, having no idea how she is demeaning him. And a husband says unkind things to his wife or walks away or withdraws when she is speaking to him, not realizing how unloving this feels to her. Many examples of putting love and respect into practice are given, as well as examples of what a wife finds unloving and a husband finds disrespectful.This is a great book for anyone seeking to improve their marriage according to what God says in scripture. It is balanced on both sides of the wife/husband equation; it doesn't place blame for problems directly on the woman or the man, but rather addresses how each needs to do their part in marriage. It is written in a very personable, non-condescending manner and is a very enjoyable read.I give this book five stars out of five! Love and Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs shares a simple and practical message for those looking to strengthen their marriage - the driving need for the wife to be loved and the top priority for a husband to be respected. Apart from this, things can get a little crazy. Love and Respect reveals why spouses react negatively to each other, and how they can deal with such conflict positively. I found the book to be both challenging and helpful. Challenging in that my model for how I am to love my wife is how Jesus loves the church, helpful in that it describes the 'Crazy Cycle' of conflict that so easily arises and how to break that cycle. Too often we think or act along the lines of \"I'll love my wife when...\" or \"I'll love her as long as... or if...\" On the flip side is often found \"He's not treating me right, how can I possibly respect him?\" or \"Well I'll respect him once he starts...\". These are examples of conditional love and conditional respect. Ephesians 5:33, the central verse of the book, calls us to a higher standard: \"Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\" Eggerichs explains what this looks like. The book may not be for everyone; readers who don't share this world view will likely view the book as a bit archaic, simplistic. Those who believe it 'in their heads' but don't know how to put it into practice will however find the book encouraging. The basic content and premise of this book could have been condensed into one chapter. I don't understand why this book is so popular (well actually maybe I do - because it is filled with the simpleton partner manipulating but practical advice that normally sells marriage books). The author makes some interesting observations but does little to address the root cause of problems in marriage. If you want to read a great, scriptural book on marriage, check out, \"When Sinners Say I Do\" by Dave Harvey. One of the best books I've ever read. It hit the nail right on the head as far as my marriage goes. It has helped me see some things I can change, & some things I can start doing in my marriage. Already seeing some changes in my & my husband's relationship. Some great advice and a perspective that endures because it embraces the Word of God. This first 1.5 yr has been quite the challenge. The honeymoon was over quickly and divorce has been threatened twice. A dear friend/couple loaned us their copy of the audio CD (the wife knowing the challenges our marriage has been facing). I listened to the first 3 CDs and gave them to my husband before leaving for a weekend trip to visit a girlfriend. When I came back I was disppointed to learn he had not listened, but he promised to listen \"this week\". By Thursday he was asking ME for CDs 4 and 5. He admitted it was powerful and amazing how we (married couples) have such similar experiences. I have listened to CD4 4x. I am eager to get the Respect thing down! I have already seen differences in us both and the way we interact/respond to one another! God be Praised! this book is a requirement for every new relationship! We also watched the seminar that the author did and it was priceless. I first saw Dr. Emerson Eggerichs when he did a series of teachings about love and respect at my Church in Fort Myers. His thoughts were fresh and new and now he has published a book that teaches the same principles. The book \"Love and Respect\" by Emerson Eggerichs has totally changed my view on how relationships are supposed to be maintained in a Godly way. The realization that men and women are created with different needs is one that doesn't take long to figure out, but when broken down the way that Dr. Eggerichs does, the truths behind the principals of Love and Respect are mind blowing. The foundation of any relationship is shown to be the connection that God has given men and women and how gender based personality tributes affect the way we view each other, which is groundbreaking for Christian counseling and just understanding alike. I am not married yet, but this book has given me the opportunity to further understand women and what I can expect when I begin the process that God has laid out for me. The book is witty and an overall very enjoyable read and the value of the lessons are priceless. I believe that Emerson's ministry is one of the top tier ministries for teaching the couples how god intended marriage to be and is vital for a church whose divorce rate often rivals that of the secular world. Thank you for all your insight Dr. Eggerichs! One fine example of the idiocy of this book is that the author forgot his wife's birthday one year. Because she did not remind him about it and then got upset when he forgot, HE felt undermined (because she didn't remind him) and judged and put down (because she called him out) and therefore disprespected. THEN he follows with a statement about how he wouldn't have been able to say that he felt 'disprespected' at that time because the feminists were going at full blast back then. Oh I forgot how oppressed the white male became during the feminist period....This book encourages the wife to be submissive and to let the man have the final say in all decisions in the household. It claims that NO successful business has ever been ran by two heads (so I guess that means Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Intel, Boeing, Ford, Motorola etc. are not successful).Husband and wife BOTH deserve and want love and respect, and that will lead to a successful marriage. If you are fully prepared to lose your self-respect in order to serve your husband hand and foot, good luck with this book. This is a small book that expounds on the title theme: that men need respect and women need Love. The author includes a chapter on each love and respect, and also a chapter on communicating with love and respect. It is a simple theme that the author backs up with scripture.I really appreciated this book, though i was a little disappointed at first when i recieved it! I was expecting a full size book, and this seemed almost like a little coffee table book, and as I started reading, it only solidified that opinion for the first chapter or so. There are lots of pages with one little blurb throughout the book and i worried that it was going to be a fluffy superficial mess. As I kept reading though, i really appreciated the premise and could totally see that at work in my own marriage. I appreciated his use of scripture to back up the themes and a different take on the verse about respecting your husbands- i had always seen it almost as putting the wife lower than the husband, but from the author's discussion, began to see that its another one of those things where men and women are wired differently! I wish there's been a little more in depth descriptions of how to live it out, but that's probably the point (they have a whole \"business\" based on this concept from what I saw! I saw a few reviews saying that this book is sexist, and perhaps there is a slant that way, but if you read it critically looking for what you can gain for your marriage, instead of feeling put down (women!) because you have to \"respect\" or whatever, then you will definitely gain insight into how to improve your marriage. I liked that it was fairly short and simple; its good for my husband who's not a big reader!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com &lt;[..]> book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 [...] : \"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\" I am SO upset I spent money on this book before reading the reviews. It is just terrible.He blames almost every marital problem on the wife (specifically, his); he insults the reader by repeating the SAME idea again and again and again; he is so full of himself he includes different versions of the same testimonial (\"your program saved my marriage\") letter at least twice in each chapter; and he identifies himself as a thinker and then treats the reader like a moron. I have NEVER before read a book that DEFINED the vocabulary within the content. Especially simplistic words. At one point he says, \"She accuses him of being overly patriarchal (fatherly)...\" are you kidding me? His metaphors are on par with a first grader \"...like selling farm equipment to the Amish.\"And his examples, which he applies to entire gender sets, are insulting. He compares his irritability with his wife's inability to properly prepare his eggs -- a FAVOR she is doing for him by making him food (!); with her irritability over his inability to pick up after himself (she has to hang up his wet towels and close cabinet doors for him because he is too busy \"thinking\" to do those kinds of things).I am very curious about where \"Dr.\" Eggerichs earned his doctorate, because his critical thinking and writing skills are lacking. I imagine it is not an accredited university doctorate.I am just astounded by the number of people who gave this book a favorable review. It is sexist; poorly written; and alarming in that people are \"buying\" this guys spew.Ugh.If you are looking for a helpful book Captivating / Wild at Heart hit on the same idea in a much more eloquent and helpful manner. Dr. Emerson Eggerichs talks about the \"Crazy Cycle\" in marriages. Most people that know us would agree that our house is crazy. LOL But that's not the crazy cycle he talks about. The gist of the crazy cycle is without love the wife reacts and without respect the husband reacts. And this cycle just keeps going and going until someone decides to stop the cycle. I had never thought of it this way, but it makes perfect sense. If I don't feel loved by my hubby then there are times where I don't act out of respect to him. He sees no respect and he may react without love towards me. And so on and so forth. He talks about how to notice when the cycle is happening and how to prevent it from getting out of control. How to prevent it all together.As with any book you need to be discerning. Don't take what someone says as 100% truth just because they say so. (Not that I found anything to disagree with) I just wanted to remind people of that point. Dr Eggerichs understands how communication between a husband and a wife can be complicated. I think anyone would agree. There are always jokes about men not understanding women. But the whole thing pretty much boils down to unconditional respect for him and unconditional love for her.This is another book that I would recommend. Learn to stop the crazy cycle and initiate the Energizing Cycle so the Rewarded Cycle can be enjoyed. The wisdom of how a man and woman can maintain the early love and respect that hopefully occured when they started dating is explained in clear words. The key instruction, which Emerson explains so well has been right under our noses for over two centuries in another Book that happens to be the number one best seller every year. I won't give away the key secret because you have to get this book and read it -hopefully- with the one you care for. I lost a dear wife 8 years ago to sudden illness. I hope I was applying some of these principals. I see, thru this book, why she was acting the way she was at times. I am sure I misread some of her signals. I see how I could have done so much better and made her happier. I have a freind who attended the conference's that are associated with this book and she said it was incredible as is the DVD series that they also own. I am so glad she told me about it. Required reading for any future or current couple. Enjoy. Any book is completely dangerous when you try to make it law. However, the author here is completely careful:\"Most men...\"\"Most women...\"Skimming for the gold and letting the impurities burn away, this book is an excellent resource to help in marital communication. I have a difficult time communicating my feelings and this book has helped me in a long ways to communicate with my beautiful wife.What I appreciate most about the book is the necessity in changing my instincts. Where my instincts tell me to zig, this book showed me how to zag when I am talking to my wife. When I am not mindful and stand like a wall when talking to her, the book clearly instructs me to close the distance between her and me. Where I think there is no harm in stonewalling her, instead I need to make a conscious effort to share my feelings with her. (In a smaller way, this book has helped me communicate better with my little girls.)Overall, even if you do not wholly subscribe to the Love and Respect aspect of the wife and husband relationship, it is just good to be aware of what is going on underneath the surface of every communication opportunity and be able to speak more clearly and tenderly to one another. The book was in the condition described. The outer jacket was a little more damaged than I was expecting, but the hardcover and pages were perfect. Shipped quick. Overall, good experience. This book is a must have for people in a great marriage or in a marriage in shambles. Read the words on the pages and absorb the information. Be open minded and try it, regardless of your religious beliefs. This is a great resource for engaged and married couples. Simple, easy to follow and insightful, Emerson Eggerich's marriage manual should be read by anyone seeking to be godly and to have a godly marriage. I think author Tricia Goyer sums it up when she says: \"The amazing thing is that when you do look for ways to show respect, and you do work at it, your needs are met, too. Because your husband is getting what he needs, he pours out his love in return.Emerson Eggerich, in his book Love and Respect, calls this the Energizing Cycle. \"Her love motivates his respect. His respect motivates her love.\" I can confess, being in this cycle is indeed energizing . . . and fun!So why is respect still a foreign word even to those of us who know its power? This is a hard one, since many times we weren't raised seeing it lived To put it in a more culture-friendly term, another word for respect is admiration.\"I learned much about respecting my husband ... his needs, my needs and God's purpose for marriage. I also appreciated Eggerich's humor. Well balanced 'story' telling and practical application. A must read! Too much repetition for my taste, but I got a lot out of this book that I needed to hear. I appreciated the acronyms and -- while lacking -- the specific anecdotes and examples were helpful to me. There are 24 chapters in this book. Seven of them focus on a how a husband should love his wife as Christ loved the church. In the other 17 chapters, the author blames every marital problem imaginable on the wife's inability to respect her husband, including her refusal to have enough sex to satisfy him. Approximately 1/3 of the book are not the author's words, but letters written from people who have attended the \"Love & Respect\" seminar, which is repeatedly touted as the cure-all for everything that ails your marriage.There are several biblical errors, for example stating that when Eve was deceived by the Serpent, Adam wasn't there, thus when sin entered the world, it wasn't Adam's fault, but Eve's. In fact Romans 5:12 places the burden upon Adam, saying, \"...sin entered the world through one man...(NIV)\" The author states, \"Totally deceived, Eve ate some of the fruit. Then Adam came up (or perhaps she went and found him)...(see Genesis 3:1-6).\" But Genesis 3:6 clearly states, \"she also gave some to her husband, who was WITH HER.\" (HCSB, emphasis mine)The book makes wild claims that if a wife will just respect her husband, everything in their marriage will be great. In Chapter 5, the author asserts that, \"when a wife respects her husband...he starts rolling out the red carpet for her!\" Literally, he states that all she has to do is say, \"I respect you,\" and he will then love her like Christ loved the Church, and he will now be the perfect husband. If it were that easy, marriage books would not be overflowing my bookshelf and no wife would ever feel unloved.The book repeatedly claims that the notion of \"unconditional respect\" is so new and shocking, that most have never heard of it, and only by attending one of their conferences can we really learn about it. Unconditional submission has been the marital mantra of the evangelical church since forever, and this is nothing new at all. Saying \"respect\" instead of \"submission\" is semantics, and this book gives the same rules of evangelical marriage I've always heard: \"Rule #1-the husband is always right. Rule #2-if the husband is wrong, see Rule #1.\" Women need to be loved, cherished, honored, and protected. As leader of the home and the one in direct submission and accountability to Christ, the husband needs to do these things and then submission is positively easy and a joy. I'm not saying a wife should not respect her husband if he isn't cherishing her, I'm saying submission is not the horrific chore some think it is. When my husband loves me like Christ, I LOOK for ways to submit to him. I love doing it! It brings me joy! Treat me like a sex object and a maid, and unconditional respect/submission is like asking me to walk to Alaska in concrete boots. Possible, yes. Fun and joyful, no.The final nail in the coffin of this book as far as I was concerned was in Chapter 24: \"A man who strays is usually given total blame for his affair, but in many cases he is the victim of temptation that his wife helped bring up on him [by not giving him enough sex].\" This is indicative of the entire book, shelving responsibility for oneself and placing it upon the other person, namely the wife in this book's case. When marital struggles bring couples to their knees, they have to take responsibility for their own actions, focus on their own personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and get right with God. When our spiritual lives are in tune and the Holy Spirit is the One in control, many marital problems may fall away. Blaming the other person will get you nowhere.I gave it two stars because there is some redeeming value in the information on ways to respect your husband and ways a husband can show love to his wife. But if you are a wife in an emotionally abusive relationship, this book may bring you bigger trouble. I recommend Gary Thomas' book \"Sacred Marriage\". This book was a fantastic resource for me. It has helped me understand the man in my life and have a better clue of what he needs from me. It was eye opening to realize that what he needs from me is not the same as what I need from him...If you are in a relationship, or ever plan to be, you should read this book. I think this is a good book to help couples acknowledge the symptoms of a marriage focused on trying to get deep longings met from each other rather than from God. But the book seldom goes below the surface \"fixes\". It doesn't really touch the neccesary parts of love and respect that involve pursuing the heart and areas that aren't easily walked into- sin, betrayal, authenticity, and the lies we believe, etc. Somehow i missed that this was large print- but otherwise i am liking what i am reading and i beleive it will help get our new marriage off to a right start. I've seen this material work over and over again. Divorce papers put through the shredder and deeper intimacy created. Whether you are struggling in marriage or just looking to create more intimacy. Love and Respect will help.It is insightful, simple and direct for all to grasp. You will laugh together and cry together as you read that you are normal. You'll have new tools that are easy to put into action.If you are honest and teachable with a genuine desire to look at yourself instead of pointing at your spouse as the problem you will enjoy working through this together. Although the author is a bit redundant in his message, his points are excellent! God created men and women differently. This book helps couples understand those differences and enjoy them!! Love & Respect is very well written and shines a new light on the dynamics of a relationship. Every couple should read it!! The message contained within this book is good, although the book itself is much too long and poorly written. While reading it, I got the distinct impression the author was merely filling up pages without presenting any new information. There are also a few catch phrases the author uses over and over which are extremely annoying. When my new girlfriend told me that she had bought this book to read with her old boyfriend who wanted no part of it, I decided that I will purchase a copy so we could read it together, and learn the techniques that the author had cleverly outlined in it, for the benefit of having and maintaining a good and healthy relationship. We are currently in chapter two, and are enjoying every minute reading this book together.I have learned, which this book has also outlined, that the secret to a good relationship is as follows. \"In order to have and maintain a great and healthy relationship, your level of commitment has to be higher than your feelings.\" If we all should keep this in mind, we will have great relationships. In my opinion, the biggest devil in most relationships is \"selfishness.\" This is an awesome book, and I will recommend it to anyone who is seeking the techniques that can used in everyday relationships. I've been married for 34 years before I read this book. Nothing has changed my marriage for the better than this book. Dr. Eggerich has communicated a Biblical principle clearly yet humorously.I purchase this book to give away to any one in my world who wants to improve their marriage.Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs My husband and I read this book with a group of friends. It was well explained, fair to both partners,and wonderfully easy to apply to real life. I would have to say the greatest thing about this book was how well the author understood me as a woman as well as marriage relationships in general. In the group of us who read this our ages differed vastly as well as the amount of time all of us had spent being married, all of found this book to be wonderfully helpful. I have recommended the book to others and will continue doing so. Wow! Dr. Eggerichs message is so simple, but too often has gone absent from marriage seminars and counseling. The key - to give your mate what they need not what you want to receive.I borrowed the book from a friend, and immediately ordered 2. One for us and one for a couple we knew that were headed to divorce - they are singing another tune.An absolute must read for even the greatest of relationships. Thank you Dr Eggerichs! \"Love and Respect\" gives Godly insight into how men and women can relate to one another to save a bad marriage or make even the best marriage better! That insight can also be used to improve non-marital relationships involving male and female - parent/child, brother/sister, at work, at church, and anywhere else in life. I highly recommend the book, the audio CD's, and the associated products and seminars to everyone. I have often thought about getting Love and Respect, and was glad for the opportunity to read it, especially have a respected pastor recommended it. I will admit that I went into the book somewhat skeptical and was ready to put the book on the shelf after the first half. My greatest challenge for the first half was the answer to the question, what is our greatest need? Is my greatest need as a man to be respected? Is my wife's greatest need to be loved? I believe the greatest error of the book is in applying Ephesians 5 without the foundation of Ephesians 1-4. What is our greatest need? Paul, in the first four chapters of Ephesians answers that our greatest need is Christ. If I gain the respect of my wife and every other person, and have not Christ, what do I have? If my wife has all of my love, but not Christ, what am I really giving her? Perhaps the author assumes the reader knows his or her greatest need.However, the application of Ephesians 5 makes the book worth the read. I appreciate the suggestions at the end of each chapter that provide for conversation and application. The author suggests that women need:ClosenessOpennessUnderstandingPeacemakingLoyaltyEsteemAnd men need:ConquestHierarchyAuthorityInsightRelationshipSexualityThe book is obviously written from a male perspective. This is reflected in some negative comments about the book on other reviews. Yet, what marriage/relationship would not grow as a result of implementing the above principles and techniques? One would do well to pursue such growth, while rooting the marriage in a commitment to Christ.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free from book sneeze for this review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 : \"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\" This was a great book and a real eye opener into how so many relationships fail due to the lack of respect and love in a relationship. Woman tend to shut down when the feel unloved and men in turn shut down when they feel disrespected. This book shows you as a couple how to work through these difficulties and teaches you how to show one another love and respect! This is a must read for any couple young or old alike. It is a profound mystery why in this day and age so many people refuse to recognize that there are certain fundamental differences between men and women. And, as the French might say, \"Vive la difference!\" However, for many couples, these differences are a source of frustration, confusion, and anger.This need not be so.Thank God for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs, who's simple-but-wise approach finds its relevant, relevatory, and revolutionary roots in the ancient truths of Scripture. In unearthing some clear, but subtle differences in the needs and expectations of men and women, Dr. Eggerichs unlocks a treasure trove of useful solutions to common problems many couples face.Dr. Eggerichs also understands the power of habits or cycles, which can perpetuate themselves over long periods of time. Bad or crazy cycles can lock a couple into a downwardly-spiralling, soul-crushing prison, but breaking into cycles of change and passion creates power that can carry a couple, like the tides, into a renewed and lasting healthy relationship.This book will help those who are considering marriage, those who are newly married, those who have been happily married for years, those who are in a crisis in their marriage, and those who have experienced the pain of a broken marriage. Beyond that, it's a valuable tool towards understanding the different ways in which men and women think and respond...and how to improve our communication together. I read half way through this book. I regret reading that much of it. As many of the other reviewers have stated, I found this book to be sexist. The examples Dr. Eggerichs gave were one sided and always favored the husband. Dr. Eggerichs focus was on how a women could positively change the marriage by respecting her husband. He stated in general women nag & criticize their husbands and thus disrespect them. Although, I agree respect is important and nagging & contempt are detrimental, these rules should apply to both partners.I gasped when I read Dr. Eggerich's statement (pg36)concerning the difficulties of living with women who are PMSing. He writes \"Everyone ducks for cover when Mom is in that kind of mood. No one doubts her basic mother love, but sometimes they're not so sure she really likes them.\" He further references PMS as pre murder syndrom. Im am not an expert other than to say that I am an adult woman and I know many other adult women. It is in my experience that myself and the other women in my life have not had a problem with emotional mood swings related to their monthly cycle since puberty. I find Dr. Eggerich's comments in this respect to be disconnected and with out understanding.I hope I convince any potential readers from not buying this book. I really feel Eggerichs reveals things about husbands and wives that we wouldn't learn without this book.We have a good marriage, but thanks to this book we've never been better! Love and Respect deals with the two areas a husband and wife need from one another: Wives need to feel loved and husbands need to feel respected.Love & Respect deals with the two areas a husband and wife need from one another: Wives need to feel loved and husbands need to feel respected.While the author seems to be very knowledgable about the content of which he's writing, I found each section of the book to be very repetitive.How many times do we need to read that a husband should love his wife unconditionally and a wife should respect her husband unconditionally?I understand the need to go through each scenario, and the first-hand testimonies were a nice addition; and I understand this is based on their Love & Respect Conferences so the book reads as if you're attending one.But once you understand his point: Love & Respect, you're good to go. Hopefully you'd be smart enough to figure the rest out on your own.Maybe not...maybe that's why this book has done so well. The book gives some helpful insight. However, I will save you a lot of time. This about sums it up. Wives, respect your husband and then he will love you. You would be better off reading some material from Family Life Today. This book had an important message. My wife had read it in the early part of our marriage, and had tentatively suggested I read it also. Of course, it took me five years to pick it up but I wish I had sooner. I laughed out loud at the accuracy of the descriptions of the feel of our crazy cycle arguments. I would imagine you will have similar moments of almost excruciating recognition.It has given me the language of being able to articulate my feelings and thus own them.My only two criticisms are:- it is repetitive at the beginning- it is biased towards the wife taking more responsibility for unconditional respect than the husband giving unconditional love.The \"answers\" COUPLE and CHAIR are simple yet profound. I think this book will make a huge difference in most marriages and it allows me to feel excited and optimistic about ours. I have read this book before and ordered it for someone who is considering remarrying. I agree with 85-90% of the ideas presented. Excellent for own use and to share with others. Helps someone know what marriage is about and how to develop great relationships. This is a wonderful book that takes the complexities of achieving marital bliss and whittles them down to two needs. Dr. Eggeriches tells couples that they can avoid the \"Cycle\" by considering the emotional requirements of their spouse. His conclusions are based on several fabulous yet common examples taken directly from his experiences as well as those of whom he has counseled. To put it simply, a women needs love and a man requires respect in order to avoid the pitfalls of a \"Cycle\" of destruction.Love & Respect is a must for all traditional marriages. Whether our relationships are six months old or sixty years young this book will without a doubt help make sense out of most every relationship issue. Eggeriche's book should be required reading by married couples as well as those who counsel them.Dr. Eggeriche's book covers so many areas of spousal importance that it is almost \"A Marriage Manual for Life.\" Love and Respect is a comprehensive compilation for creating an enduring relationship. Rarely does a book personally inspire me as this did. Please know that I would consider it an honor to work with Dr. Eggeriche on any of his future works. Well done! This may be difficult for stubborn or hard headed people to take in. I have enjoyed reading it in my forties and find it to be true. However, I would have probably tossed it in a bon fire in my twenties! It is biblically based and the reader must be ready to read it and in a &#34;teachable&#34; moment otherwise it will do not good and quite possible increase anger. Again, I do find it to be very helpful and truthful. This book covers new ground in relationships and possible explains so much of what is wrong in our modern marriages. This book is based on this: women are motivated by love, men are motivated by respect. The author uses Biblical verses as the basis for the whole book. I wasn't sure about it when a friend recommended it, but now that I've read it and started applying the concepts I've seen it work! My disagreements with my husband turned into communication rather than a feud. It may not work perfectly every time, but that's because no one is perfect. We still make mistakes and misunderstand each other, but it occurs far less often than it used to. Even if you aren't a Christian, I can guarantee that the concepts presented in this book can transform your relationship from bad to good; good to great; and great to greater!I thank God for this book everyday. I wish I would have read it before we were married over six years ago. It is slowly restoring our relationship. I am hoping we can attend one of the conferences available as well. Love & Respectby Dr. Emerson EggerichsI found this book to be on par with John Gray's Men are From Mars; Women are from Venus book. Dr. Eggerichs discusses the differences between men and women and how each needs to be more in touch with what the other one needs. When men attempt to treat their wives as they would want to be treated, they inevitably end up doing the \"wrong\" thing and when women attempt to love their husband as they want to be loved, they also do the \"wrong\" thing. If you are a Christian, you will be pleased that Dr. Eggerichs bases his book on Biblical scriptures. If you do not consider yourself a religious person, I don't believe the scripture verses take anything away from the message.Dr. Eggerichs mainly focuses on the woman's need for love and the man's corresponding need for respect. He says that there is a \"Crazy Cycle\" where when men feel disrespected, they withdraw their love from the relationship and when women feel unloved, they withdraw their respect from the relationship. In relationships where this cycle has been raging, it is difficult to find someone willing to break the cycle because he or she finds it hard to believe that if the husband is more loving toward his wife, she will respond with less criticism and more respect. Similarly, if the wife is more respectful toward her husband, he will respond with more loving behavior.Dr. Eggerichs calls this the \"Energizing Cycle\" and he supports it with very specific behaviors each gender must use. He says women need C-O-U-P-L-E, while husbands need C-H-A-I-R-S. Yes, these are acronyms for spelling love to the wife and respect to the husband. All of what he says appears to be in line with what I believe is true of the majority of men and women in relationships.The final section of his book is more for Christians as he describes the \"Rewarded Cycle.\" This is where he instructs couples that their reward for loving their wives and respecting their husbands is in heaven and a person really does it to serve God.As a highly spiritual but non-religious person, I found the book to be very helpful and I think it is a great book for both men and women who are looking for some common sense ideas about improving their relationship. I hardly ever take the time to write reviews, but I cannot keep quiet about this resource. If you read nothing else regarding Marriage and relationships, READ THIS BOOK!!! (Or listen to the CD ver.) I have read and attended many, many books, classes, seminars, etc. and nothing compares. This is BY FAR the best, most interesting, insightful, profound, life-changing (in a GREAT way) resource I have ever come across on this topic. You and your entire family will be ENORMOUSLY blessed by this--even if your spouse does not go through it as well.May God use this to free you (and your spouse) up to be ALL that you can be in your short life here on earth. He has GREAT plans for you and the biblical information in the resource will go a long way toward increasing your effectiveness!For you women, Shaunti Feldhahn's \"For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men\" is a much more concentrated, in-depth version of some of the things Eggerich's covers. If focuses only from the female perspective, so it is a quicker read, and at least as profound. LIFE-CHANGING!! ...A Must-read, for sure!! (Eggerich and Feldhahn endorse and reference each other also.)God Bless you to be ALL that He intends in your invaluable role as husband or wife!--Carol Hines",

         "Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need",
         "I'm always asking, &#34;How do you do it?&#34; This book answered so many questions and provided tons of insight into why some movies and stories work and why others don't. I can't watch a movie now without putting it into Blake's genres.Great ideas, succinct writing, five stars. Because STORY is the most important thing about most movies, this book is the BEST screenwriting book i've ever read. Blake gets to the point and HAMMERS it home---WHAT IS YOUR MOVIE ABOUT? If you take more than 10 seconds to answer that question, you need to rethink your movie.I reread this book before I begin each new script.Screenwriter of BULLSEYE, DEXTER MURPHY'S EXPIRATION DATE, FANTASY FOOTBALL THE MOVIE, TAKE ME AWAY... I read and studied the book and I believe it's good to get a feeling for the film structures. I can find the 3 act structure and most of the beats in films while having the beat sheet next to me although not every film seems to hit all the beats in my experience. Maybe this depends on genre (some genres are not using all the beats?) or maybe it depends on the way films are edited after being written.The book offers a lot of tools that can make a screenplay stronger. Personally, I still like to have other books next to it, like \"Story\" by Robert McKee and The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler. I believe that every book that you read about screenplay will make you think in another way about films and will help you write the next one even better.Andr&eacute; I used to love to write, but I can thank a college professor for putting the kabash on that one. Until recently, that is. I often think of wonderful story ideas, and write them down when they are more than just okay. But then I don't know what to do with those ideas, how to expand on them.Recently I saw a writing class advertised. So I signed up and bought the course book, which was Save the Cat by Blake Snyder. This was a start, I told myself. Little did I know that I was about to read one of the industry \"bibles\" on screenwriting. Also, little did I know that the morning after my second class the wonderful and generous Blake Snyder was going to leave us, taking to heaven before I could ask him all of my questions (I tried the email in the book but guess he didn't have a \"ghost writer\" yet :)Anyway, all in all I found the book so wonderful that I picked up the next one \"Save the Cat Goes to the Movies\"....to refine my ideas and channel things efficiently.Just buy it. You'll see! This book delivered on it's promise. Great tool for writers of fiction, not just screen writers. Engaging and informative. If this guy ever offers a class, I'd love to take it. This is a great book, especially when you say to yourself \"stop it Robert McKee, I can't take anymore of your sh&*^%%&!\" Blake talks to you like an old pal instead of a Harvard professor. And although I prefer a Harvard professor most of the time, Save the Cat is a great stray that strengthened my writing significantly. Thank you Blake Snyder... RIP! This book is a 'must read' for anybody in the film industry - whether a writer, producer, director, editor or actor. It is an easy read packed with valuable information on how a film should be structured. The rules set out in this book apply to all types of film making, whether a feature, documentary or 30 second ad. With \"Save the Cat\" Blake Snyder has broken down the screenwriting process to the precise craft that it is. With humor and insight, he's taken his wealth of knowledge accumulated over many years of successful screenwriting and defined the process of developing a \"good idea\" into a saleable product in easily repeatable steps.Even though I'm a seasoned, veteran writer, I still found Snyder's insights and tools invaluable. (I wish I knew this stuff 20 years ago!)STC is not only for screen-writers, it's for screen-watchers as well. If you've ever wondered why you loved one film while not enjoying another apparently very similar one, this book will show you how to understand the difference.A quick and entertaining read, Save the Cat is a must for anyone, expert and novice alike, interested in the process and machinery of creating a successful screen story. I bought this book as supplemental reading material for a recent screenwriting class, thinking that some added insight and information certainly couldn't hurt my grade. What I didn't expect, however, was that I would find this book more helpful than the course's required text.While this book does not teach you how to write artsy David Lynch or Christopher Nolan films, it will certainly teach you the basic structure most Hollywood blockbusters follow. In other words, Snyder, based on his years of experience, teaches you how to write what sells.Snyder lays out the basics of format and plot structure in a very easy to follow guide that even provides exercises to attempt along the way. The author simplistically advises on how to start with creating a winning logline, then figure out how to make the idea new and unique, and then lay the crucial plot elements out on \"the board\" as broken down by act. Snyder even gives advice on how to create a likeable and unforgettable hero, which is of course crucial to any story. However, once that script seems finished, the author advises on the necessity of editing, and gives numerous tips on what to look for throughout the editing (or perhaps rewriting) process.Throughout the books entirety, Synder never seems condescending or preachy. Though he may come across as a tad egotistical, his knowledge is extremely practical and very straight-forward. His writing style cuts right to the chase. He even breaks hints down into memorable catch-phrases that are not soon forgotten.If you're looking to write something different and unconventional, this may not be your go-to guide. That is not to say though, that not every writer can learn something from this book. On the contrary, I think there is something to be learned within these pages for every Hollywood hopeful, as well as most seasoned screenwriting veterans. However, if you're just starting out and looking to write something that will sell and go from page to screen, then this book is definitely a must, and a very good place indeed to start. I'm not a screenwriter, but I found this book to be a wonderful guide into how movies work.Snyder describes movies as Swiss-clock-like emotion machines, and his method breaks the gears down to show you how they are put together. Someone interested in writing screenplays will find the advice invaluable, as Snyder dissects a movie into small, manageable chunks so that you can see how to make each piece.But it's equally enjoyable for someone who's just interested in watching movies. After reading this book, I started seeing movies in a whole different light: I can see how the B story functions; I can tell when the midpoint is giving you that false sense of victory/defeat; I can see how all the \"beats\" in the script make appeals to very primal instinctual desires.If you like movies at all, you'll enjoy this book. It's definitely not meant for writers alone. In fact, I've already put this on the syllabus for my screenwriting classes.This ranks up there with Bill Martell's \"Secrets of Action Screenwriting\" and William Goldman's \"Adventures of the Screen Trade\" as a source for no-nonsense, straightforward screenwriting advice. No can't-keep-'em-straight-without-a-program Campbellian archetypes, none of the \"script-Nazi\" McKee Commandments. This is the real stuff, from a fellow who should know what he's talking about.Practical, intelligent, easy to follow, and funny. I can't say enough about \"Save the Cat!\" Just buy it and thank me later. If you are an aspiring screenwriter, this is a quick read and gives you one slant on the basics of screenwriting. However, I would read other books or take an online class to get a more broad perspective on writing screenplays. The \"grain of salt\" refers to the fact that Snyder has only one movie to his credit, Blank Check (of which he freely admits), so you have to be careful with just how seriously you take his advice to heart. There are many other great books out there in Amazon-land that do a much more thorough, and realistic job of teaching you about writing for the blockbuster movie. \"The Idiot's guide to Screenwriting\" by Skip Press is just one good example, and more practical. Nonetheless, I would still recommend this in your reading repertoire. I'm a journalist working on a book and picked up Blake Snyder's book on a recent trip to LA. What a kick!Though I have no plans to write a screenplay, Snyder's book is helpful to any writer who wants to tell a good story, especially for people working on longer pieces. STC is full of fun details, neat tricks of the trade and screenwriting secrets. Snyder has a great way of communicating challenging storytelling concepts without resorting to trade lingo. Save The Cat is useful and inspiring.(I'll also never watch a movie the same way again.)I just purchased two extra copies for young friends who are aspiring writers and I know that they will love it. Blake Snyder's SAVE THE CAT! Could also be called SAVE THE SCREENWRITER!, because that's exactly what it will do: Save the screenwriter time, save the screenwriter frustration, and save the screenwriter's sanity. Blake takes you behind-the-scenes and into the decision-makers' offices as he explains how the Hollywood system works and what writers should expect as they journey through the perilous maze of Hollywood. Like many other reviewers I've read a number of books on the art and science (yes, some do make it seem like a science) of screenwriting. This book stands atop the pile. My second favorite book in this genre is the classic Story by Robert McKee, and the two couldn't be more different in tone or content, particularly tone. As much as I valued the advice and knowledge imparted by the venerable McKee, the tone was professorial at the least. Reading Snyder on the other hand is more akin to having a beer with a buddy - easy flowing, fun, with lots of insights you can immediately apply (although the insights don't flow as freely as the beer when I catch up with my old buddies).I took a screenwriting course from a well-known institution in L.A. recently and as much as I enjoyed the experience and was impressed by the instructors, it wasn't until I read this book that the 'AHAs' started to rain down on me. He takes what is undeniably a highly complex subject and breaks it down into digestible chunks without diluting the core concepts critical in developing a script worthy of Hollywood consideration. There are many pithy sayings you'll find yourself muttering long after reading the book, both while writing and while watching movies. And, best of all, they're all extremely helpful for your writing process. My favorite is his admonition of the vital nature of the 'whiff of death' in your screenplay. Read the book and you'll find out what he means. I'm also sure you'll agree 100% when you analyze the advice through the prism of your movie-viewing experience.Again, great advice delivered in an entertaining package - don't miss it! Blake Snyder has accomplished the rare task of making it not only thoroughly enjoyable to read about structure, genre and commercial considerations, but has also injected this peculiar book segment with a much needed and sought-after dose of realism, practicality and experience. Here is a hands-on guide to writing solid, commercially viable screenplays.If your shelves are bending, as are mine, under the weight of \"how-to\" books on every conceivable aspect of screenwriting, and your mind is blocked with conflicting concepts and approaches from all sorts of self-proclaimed writing teachers who share nothing but the conviction that they've got it all figured out even though they lack any credits of sold or even produced scripts - - - well, here's a refreshing change from all of this.Snyder has sold numerous pitches and scripts to Disney and other big-name studios, and saw some of them actually make it to the screen. This alone sets him apart from 90% of those 'experts' out there.Granted, you may have to tweak your arthouse ideas to follow Snyders approach; but you might actually end up writing a script to professional quality. And you can always save that episodic multi-national ensemble piece playing in a Coca farmer's Peruvian mountain hut with internet access for later, when your name is hot on the market. This book is hands down the best book out there. And, believe me, I have read them all. Blake explains in a very entertaining way the key elements of storytelling and gives tremendously helpful suggestions on how to organize and develop scripts. If you want the inside scoop on what sells and why, BUY THIS BOOK! The loss of Blake Snyder was a huge loss to the screenwriting and novel writing world! Easy to read and entertaining, Save The Cat! is definitely the way to go for beginning screenwriters and those who wish to learn to analyze novels and movies for their structure. Each \"beat\" of the storyline is explained in detail with a multitude of examples from popular movies. A great tool for screenwriters and for novelists who want to take their plotting to the next level and ensure they have all the points before they get down to writing. Highly recommended! I highly recommend this book. After struggling with several drafts of a script for years, I was given a copy of Save the Cat by a friend. I eagerly read and followed the suggestions and within two months had a completed version of the script that is greatly improved over any of the other drafts I wrote. I am now actively shopping the completed script to production companies and have made it through the first act of a second script following the beat sheet laid out in the book.Save the Cat has helped me more than any other screenwriting book I have ever read (and there are many). It was enjoyable to read, lays out a clear strategy and when you apply all the tools suggested, it really does help shape your story. The hard part is still writing the actual script, but with Save the Cat as a guide, the process became a lot easier. Lot's of good practical advice. One of those books that is helpful to review periodically for fresh insights. This book is essential to understanding the major components for story construction for both novels and movies. A must have for any novice storyteller If you want to know how to direct good movies would you read a book by Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg? Mr. Spielberg, I think. So if you want to know how to write good screenplays do you read a book from the guy who wrote \"Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot\" and \"Blank Check\"? I did and I'm sorry for it. He basicly dishes out advice and then sort of contradicts himself. For example, he says all main characters should be introduced or hinted at within the first ten pages(minutes). Then he uses \"Star Wars\" as an example as a good movie that does things right. I agree. I it's my favorite movie. But aren't Luke Skywalker and Han Solo introduced after the first ten minutes? It's a lot of things like that. So why should anybody listen to him? Don't buy this book. I've found this book very helpful in many ways. The problem is that any book that claims to have THE answer or THE formula for a great movie is setting you up for disappointment. I have no doubt that if you follow this formula, you could end up with a career much like Blake Snyder's - two mediocre credits to your name and a whole bunch of uncredited script doctoring jobs. For people who want a little more from their writing career, I would caution you against sticking too closely to Snyder's formula. This extremely overrated book doesn't deserve the accolades its getting. There's nothing Snyder offers in this book that can't be found elsewhere and better. Snyder spends too much of the book stroking his own ego and bragging up his meager accomplishments -- he wrote Disney's Blank Check! -- and this self-importance imposes itself on all his advice.I really lost my patience with the book when I reached his section on genre. Rather than discuss genre as most people understand it -- Murder/Mystery, Sci-Fi, Romantic Comedy, etc. -- Snyder creates his own schema and new categories. This encapsulates the whole problem with the book: Snyder devotes far, far too much time to reinventing the wheel, or copying better writers and imposing his own weird theories on their ideas. Vague and unhelpful examples litter the book, with Snyder making off-hand remarks about a bad script he read once in lieu of actual text examples.Trottier'sThe Screenwriter's Bible: A Complete Guide to Writing, Formatting, and Selling Your ScriptandScreenplay: The Foundations of Screenwritingcontain all the information in this book, and present it in a clearer, more concise and less treachly manner.The only \"original\" idea in the book is found in the title -- the advice to show your protagonist \"saving a cat\", i.e. doing something kind or good -- is hardly new advice, and is really nothing more than an obvious inversion of Syd Field's advice about\"kicking the dog\" -- the idea that you can make an audience loathe an antagonist by showing them being cruel to the harmless (i.e. kick a puppy).There, I just saved you a labored reading of this entirely unnecessary book. I bought this book recently and enjoyed it a lot. It made a good companion to a few other screenwriting books I have. I am an aspiring screenwriter working on my first script. I am a writer by profession but mostly marketing materials, proposals, and policy papers (so you can say I am a seasoned fiction writer already!). I recommend this book but as a companion to:Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting; A step-by-step guide from concept to finished scriptStory: Substance, Structure, Style and The Principles of ScreenwritingWriter's Guide to Character Traits.Happy writing! I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to learn more about script writing and the movie business. Blake Snyder is funny and reverent in his writing, and shares helpful tidbits and inside secrets about the industry. Do you want to read about writing screenplays, or do you want to learn to WRITE screenplays?When it comes to finding resources that will help you write a screenplay, the choices are endless. Type the word \"screenwriting\" in Google or Amazon and you'll see what I mean. There are an abundance of highly qualified and generally helpful books to choose from. While I gained a measure of knowledge from each of them, none gave me what I ultimately needed: a solid foundation of structure - the backbone of EVERY solid screenplay. Enter Save The Cat!Structure is more than a chalk outline or generic template, it's a way to ensure that your screenplay works! This isn't just important if you want to write, pitch and SELL your screenplay in Hollywood, it's absolutely indispensable! Save The Cat! clarified the screenwriting process and showed me how to actually write a structurally-sound screenplay. What this did was free my mind of all of the cluttered questions I had regarding HOW I was going to take this awesome idea from my head and put it in the proper form in which it needs to be.In Save The Cat! The Last Book On Screenwriting You'll Ever Need, Blake Snyder leads you through the process with clarity and a sense of humor. He helps you develop a killer logline which, when done properly, is like discovering buried treasure in your front yard. He also helps you understand genre and helps you create the type of hero that serves your story well. When you're ready to write, he guides you with a beat sheet that...well...can't be...uh...beat! Seriously, it guides you through your whole story. It lets you know where holes are and confirms when you have nailed that beat.To tie the whole thing together, Blake explains the reality that studios can - and will - take your story, change or add characters, move scenes around, even change the dialogue; but if your structure is tight, it's still YOUR story. After all of your hard work, isn't that what you want?Let me quickly address the couple of nay-sayers that have described Save The Cat! as \"formulaic\" or as a \"short-cut\" to writing a movie. Blake doesn't provide a short cut or a formula; he provides a firm structure on which to build a story - YOUR story. The idea is up to you; the dialogue is up to you; the characters are up to you. So, if you have that great idea, go out and buy this book, read it, use it to build your story and develop a great screenplay. Let me say from experience that if you have an idea, it's not a fill-in-the-blanks process. Save The Cat! will get you to think about your idea - and that first logline attempt kicked my butt! When I finally felt good about my first logline though, it was a true feeling of accomplishment and well worth the effort!The best part of all this is that there's an awesome companion to the book. Now there's a Save The Cat! Story Structure Software that I just got and it is a huge help. I think it will be available on Amazon pretty soon, so look for it! On top of all of this, He's a great guy and he's actually SOLD screenplays. Wait, a screenwriting author who has sold screenplays? Go figure! This was one of the first screenwriting guides I bought and it was not very helpful. It was kind of like my class in screenwriting freshmen year-- it made my head spin. I needed more cohesive and professional guidelines about what actually goes into a publishable script.petra I'll be honest, I bought other books after this one, but most were unecessary. Blake Snyder tells you everything you need to know and you can fight it, like I did and buy other books thinking it was more complex than that or..you know you can just believe me and the book and know that this is it. Nothing more. Nothing less. I really appreciate this book because Snyder literally guides you through the important elements that every GOOD script needs to have. He shows you how to block out your story on a notebook or a cork board and I have found this method especially helpful in my own writing. If I get stuck--if I ask myself, \"Okay, what needs to happen next?\"--I simply go back and review that particular section of his book. You will breeze through Save the Cat because Snyder writes well and with a lot of wit and humor. You're still going to need to study other books about character development, plot, theme, dialog, etc.; however, this really is one of the best books on story structure. If you think this book is just for family-film-oriented writers, you missed the big picture. Blake Snyder has hit the ball way, way, way, WAY out of the park with this one. Take the analytical tools he provides and unleash them on any mainstream movie from any genre from JAWS and SAW to E.T. and BACK TO THE FUTURE. I guarantee that the ones that follow his structure most closely are the ones that not only struck a chord with viewers, but laughed all the way to the bank.Want to write a nice indy flick that you and your twenty closest friends can watch in someone's basement? Ignore Blake Snyder. Want to write a loud, crash-and-bang, content-missing movie people will forget in five years except to laugh? Ignore Blake Snyder. Want a movie you won't be able to pitch in five HOURS, let alone the five minutes you'll really have? Ignore Blake Snyder.But if you want to write/direct/produce a film that satisfies on every level from the superficial to the sublime, then this is the book for you.I never had a single offer on my work until I followed his advice.SAVE THE CAT. Live it. Love it. Learn from it. Buy extra copies, 'cause if you're smart, you'll wear out the first one. I don't know what to say I'm mixed in how I feel about this book. Positives - it is an entertaining fast read,a nd I thought it was very helpful to me personally, it was good at getting my attention. Negatives, his attitude which is condescending in general, combative, egotistical, arrogant, etc. need I say more? He certainly spends a lot of time plugging movies he's written, but I don't want to spend my money on too much advertising. I also thought the book really skimped on the details. Like when he described the Monster in the House genre - I was really interested in knowing more - and he wrote a paragraph or two and said he could write a whole book - well couldn't he have said a little more about it in this book? He didn't offer much about it. I guess what I didn't like was the RIGIDITY like the stuff that page 25 HAS to have this or page 75 HAS to have that or you need to have a do over, and that you HAVE to follow the silly structure that he outlines. Well not all stories work out like that, and the structure he outlines seems too contrived to me to be realistic. I don't know. He did get my attention and a number of ideas went through my head. I kept thinking the whole time I read this \"He must really think I'm stupid\" Mr. Snyder I AM NOT STUPID!!!! if I was stupid would I be reading your book? Unbelievable. Definitely not the last book you'll ever need, I can't believe he said that. How many books did he read before he learned what he did? Crazy. But I really enjoyed reading the book, even despite his attitude which I didn't like at all. I learned things I didn't know before so that made it worth the money to me. If you're new to the madness of screenwriting (like me) and are looking for direction from someone other than a so-called guru, most of whom have never written and/or sold a script, then read this book. It's informative and fun. I had read McKee's \"Story,\" which was valuable, but made me want to buy a bottle of Jack Daniels and a Colt .45. I really was looking for something by someone who was writing and selling and whose prose didn't encourage thoughts of suicide. Lo and behold here it is. Read it. You won't regret it. The Rules of Movie Making. Well, screenwriting, anyway. Blake Snyder knows what he is doing, he has work out there. Yet...none of the work he has out there is interesting to me. He writes family films, mainstream films, to make money. He does not hide this fact - you write screenplays to make money. Which is true when you want to eat.But many of the films I love don't follow the rules, or don't follow all the rules. True, I also think Signs was a very, very bad film. But even if they had followed his Rules, it would have still been a very, very bad film. You should get this book to, at least, know the Basic Rules. Even if you plan to break them.Liked the cover. And liked the humor. But I don't think film making is a science as much as a mixture of science and art. Rules help you stay on course but they don't tell you where you are going. YOU need to decide on where the film is going. This book is kinda difficult I believe, and would not recommend to just anyone. I purchase this book for my IPad sometime ago and I have the hard copy, but I'm not impress .Cheers,Sharif this books will not make you a writer. only writing will. read more about it in my blog. you must reinforce your writing everyday. save the cat or the countless of writing books on Amazon will not make you a writer only you can make yourself a writer.[...] I've read many books on screen writing and story structure and this is one of the best. Blake gives a lot of great advice on how to structure a compelling story and breathe life into it with characters and theme. He gives many examples of his techniques in well known films and even describes the writing process of a few of his own screenplays. The critiques of films that did not work for him was also very useful. His list of techniques to improve a story and his checklists to make sure the story is working on all levels, are well thought out. I still refer back to his \"things to watch out for\" daily.My one complaint is that at time the rules seem to strict. He says certain story events should occur on a particular page number in every screenplay. I feel like his principles are sound and helpful, but some of his rules are too constricting.Despite being geared towards film writers, this is a good read for all aspiring writers. Recommended. Simply put, Blake Snyder's \"Save the Cat\" is sheer brilliance. Everything a writer really needs to know about the craft of screenwriting is contained within the pages of this curiously entitled tome.I've read most of the best selling \"how to\" screenwriting books and found most of them to be full of esoteric theories that had little practical use when it was time to sit down and face a blank page. But \"Save the Cat\" is different. The brilliance of \"Save the Cat\" is in its deceiving simplicity. This brilliance was made apparent in the very first chapter which focuses on streamlining and nailing your concept. This vital first step is overlooked not only by every other book on screenwriting I've ever read, but also by nearly every WRITER I've ever met. Five minutes into reading Blake's book and I already had an epiphany and figured out what was wrong with a very well written script that was inexplicably missing the mark with creative execs. If only I had read this book six months ago!!!And every other chapter in \"Save the Cat\" is full of the same, well-thought out nuts and bolts instruction on how to create a well-crafted, sellable screenplay. The forms Blake includes in \"Save the Cat\" are especially helpful in organizing your screenplay's structure, no matter the genre. Again, not just theories, but helpful tools to get the job done.Here's the real shocker. Blake gives his email address in \"Save the Cat\" and asks readers to feel free to email him. I did. And the man wrote me back!!! I challenge Robert McKee to be so responsive and available to the readers of his book.I've read the reviews that chose to criticize the professional work of Blake Snyder, but I don't care if this book was written by a gaggle of chimpanzees. It's still brilliant. Whether you like Blake's movies or not is irrelevant. Blake Snyder is, without question, an incredibly gifted screenwriting coach. And that's all anyone thinking about buying this book should care about.Remember that Vince Lombardi guy? Never even played in the NFL. What the hell did he know about football... As Blake describes in his book, most Screenwirters are \"bullheaded\". I was very \"bullheaded\" when I first started to write my screenplay. I felt that picking up any book would have been good enough to teach me how to write a screenplay. I was wrong. I read two instructional books before picking up Save The Cat. The other two books put me to sleep and were more about selling your script than anything else. Save The Cat is in its own hemisphere, it teaches you how to write a screenplay the proper way.The book has made me very frustrated because it works. The book does what it should do, it makes you think hard and makes you put in hard work. Blake makes you think about improving characters, scenes, structure, openings, endings, verbiage, etc. He makes sure you do not get lost in your own bubble and instead, strengthens your skill set. Blake does not just instruct, but coaches you along your screenplay. At the end of each chapter, there are helpful exercises that you can work on to improve your writing. It is like a Football coach making his players run sprints. He makes you work hard and in the end, the hard work pays off.This is the last book you will need to pick up. Thanks to this book, I have gone back a dozen times just on my first 25 pages. Otherwise, I would have been a \"bullhead\" and was satisfied with \"My\" sceenplay.I was told a long time ago, that in order to be the best, learn from the best. Learn from someone who has had success. Blake has been successful and openly expresses all the strategies you need to know to write a great screenplay.Get this book! Great book. I am a published author and trying to break into script writing. I wish I'd had this book years ago. A must read for anyone trying to write a movie. Easy to read and lays out exactly how to write your script. I'm a professional screenwriter, and here's a typical comment I get at parties: \"Oh you're a writer? I have this great idea for a movie. All I need is someone to write the dialogue...I'll give you my idea and you write the dialogue and we'll split the money.\" These sadly misguided people are actually serious about this proposal. These people are the kind for whom \"Save The Cat\" is meant.In other words, people who think so little of the art of screenwriting that it's just \"an idea and some dialogue\" to them. Ideas are cheap and plentiful, it's the execution of the idea that matters. \"Save the Cat!\" offers no insight into the art of screenwriting, but it is a concise guide to how to write a crappy script. The fact is: the author sold several hack scripts and made money on them. The implied reasoning is \"I made money on crappy scripts, so you can, too!\" There is no disputing that crappy scripts sell and get made all the time, but you can't build a career on them. And why would you want to? Clearly the author couldn't, either, hence this book and all the other products based on it.If you haven't looked at his credits, he wrote \"Blank Check\" and \"Stop or My Mom Will Shoot.\" These movies got 4.2 and 3.4 stars on IMDB. Of course, the writer is not responsible for the final product, but from the way he talks in the book, I'm sure these screenplays were only improved in the production process.BTW, he had 3 co-writers on those movies, so we don't even know what his contribution to each of them was.If you are a good writer with actual talent and something to say, you'll benefit from Robert Mckee's \"Story.\" If your aim is much lower, then buy \"Save the Cat.\" The concepts are simple and will propel you well on your way to hack-dom. If you want to write the next \"Shakespeare in Love,\" this book ain't for you. But if you want to write the next Paris Hilton direct-to-DVD movie, the next woman-in-peril Lifetime Movie Channel schlock, or the next Tyler Perry movie, then \"Save the Cat\" is for you. (BTW, \"Shakespeare in Love\" has no \"save the cat\" moment in it. Shakespeare does not do anything to help anyone (or any cat) in the film. \"Groundhog Day\" has no such moment either -- which is kind of the point of the whole movie. Get the idea? If you want to be original, this ain't your book.)I fully realize my review may sound snobby, and perhaps it is. To be fair, the types of movies that Blake Snyder's rigid cookie-cutter formula engender certainly have their place in the business. They've been made from the beginning of cinema and continue to be made. And if that's what you're meant to write, then go for it. Just don't expect this book to elevate your idea to anywhere in the realm of art.It kind of reminds of the one and only class I ever took in filmmaking at UCLA. The teacher was an Oscar-winning producer. When he told the class the story of how he got attached as a producer to a film that won an Oscar, it was clear it was all kind of a fluke and that he personally had nothing to do with the artistic merit of the film. He concluded by saying: \"My point is that if a no-talent schmuck like me can win an Oscar and make it in this business, there's no reason why you can't either.\" I will never forget his brutal honesty. But obviously, his career did not last since there he was teaching an extension course at UCLA. But his honest assessment of the business is oddly comforting.The simple truth is that there are tons of people in the business with little or no talent who make a living. Seriously. I know -- I've worked with them. \"Save the Cat\" tells you how to be one of those people. Whether this is a good or bad thing, it's not for me to say.On the flip side, there are tons of people with oodles of talent who *don't* make it in the business because they never actually finish their screenplay. Or more likely, they finish it but never do the necessary rewrites. So if this book gets you to write and rewrite, then it will have served a good purpose.P.S. Other wonderful movies with no \"Save the Cat\" moment: Sunset Boulevard, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (I don't count him merely feeding his dog), Muriel's Wedding, Barry Lyndon, Bullets Over Broadway, Being John Malkovich, The Man Who Would Be King, True Grit, Election, The Lady Eve, The Purple Rose of Cairo, The Social Network, and of course the highest-grossing movie of all time: Gone With the Wind. And these are only the ones I could think of off the top of my head. As a non-fiction author who is just started to get involved with screenplays, I found \"Save the Cat\" a great starting point. The book was an easy read and I finished it in 2 days. The advice is solid and Snyder presents it in a clear, easy to understand format. I have all of the \"classic\" screenwriting texts and many of the more contemporary ones. Snyder's new book is going to push most of those in my collection to the very back of the shelf.This book is definitely not a Lew Hunter, David Trottier, Syd Field or Joseph Campbell how-to book with specifics on story-telling, formatting, dialog writing or breaking into the market. What this offering does, instead, is to help the writer think through the story that she wants to tell and to put it together in such a way that it's attractive to potential buyers.Examples: The first couple of chapters ask you to focus on basics first (like logline and title) because, in order to write an effective logline and a captivating relevant title, you must have a good understanding of the story you want to tell. It then moves on to the other SP components that must be clear in the writer's mind before actually sitting down to type the FADE IN.The things I found most useful: the beat sheet (ch 4) helped me visualize where the key elements needed to be placed in order to have the story be more effective. The board (ch 5) gave me a tool to help me layout the scenes structurally so that the important plot points and transitions are placed where they need to be to make the story flow.Granted, there will be those who pooh-pooh the \"put-this-event-on-this-page-and-allow-\"x\"-number-of pages-for-this-to-happen\" approach to screenwriting but I have to tell you -- I've been researching a project for almost a year now and have been struggling with the most effective way to tell this story. In one day, I was able to complete a beat sheet, complete the outline, separate the good scenes from the bad and recover the enthusiasm for this SP that I had almost a year ago when I started it.Once you have a good understanding of the basics of screenwriting, this is one of the two best books (the other is Michael Hauge's Writing Screenplays That Sell) to help you get your script in shape to make it attractive to potential buyers.Thanks, Blake! I own almost every \"how to' screenplay book on the market. I've conversed with authors, writers, editors and the like.Never before had I received the level of insightful, clear and most importantly useful information and direction such as that contained within the pages of \"Save the Cat\".If you are a struggling writer or just interested in the creative process in general this book is a delightful and entertaining read. If you are,like me, an aspiring screen writer then \"Save the Cat\" will (re)inspire you to pursue your screen writing dreams. This is a great book. I had read other books, but this one is fun and teaches at the same time. Highly recommend. The cover is sad! I do not like to see any animal dangling at the end of a rope,...let alone a cat. To say that this is \"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need,\" is an even more pathetic statement! There are many books on screenwriting, and this is merely one of them. Some people will like it, and others will not! However, writing takes much more than a formula. Some writers are talented by nature,---however writing is much like any other talent: It has to be cultivated and practiced. Each writer has his, or her own voice and style. It is sad that screenwriting and in some instances, all other writing has become a formula in order to make money, and only money, --- disregarding everything else. This is exactly why so many movies these days are so very, very bad,...because the writing is bad! Gone are the days of Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Ararbia, etc. If someone wishes to become a screenwriter, they need to sit down and to read past screenplays, watch classic movies, read books on writing, study cinema history, and even attend some proper writing classes. Yes, it is indeed hard work, and it does take much more than a formula to produce good writing. Even though this book will lead you to believe otherwise. Most importantly, when one sits down to write,--- one must feel and believe---what one is writing. Not see the dollar ($) signs with each word typed. Writing is much more than a formula. Somehow, the public has been lead to believe otherwise. Sad day for writers! Sad day for humanity! Most of all,---a very sad day for that poor cat on the cover! I LOVE this book. The writing style is easy to read and not preachy. It's like sitting down and talking with a friend over a nice beer. The tips and analysis is so very helpful. It gives me a brand new understanding towards movies and shows. I will never look at a movie the same way again.What a valuable Gem. I highly recommend this book This book was the first book in a long time that surpassed my initial expectations. I didn't know anything about Script writing and that industry, but Blake Snyder spells it out in an entertaining and humerous book. I didn't find his style obnoxious or condescending at all. It's tongue-in-cheek and cheers you on--like any good teacher would. I have all three books in the trilogy and I say, \"Two paws up\" for Save the Cat!",

         "Stranger In A Strange Land: Library Edition",
         "Michael Smith is a child born in space, because of a manned mission to Mars from Earth. The Martians raise him on their planet, and he gains unique psionic abilities because of this upbringing.When he returns to Earth he looks at things very differently to the locals, and basically straights preaching a new religion. When that happens, lots of people will get upset, particularly when it is of the love and shag all you like variety. When I read the title and the back synopsis, I was fairly interested in the book. A story about a man from Earth who was born and raised on Mars only to come back to his home planet and teach others his ways. Though the story did follow him and his teachings, they weren't what I was expecting. Rather than show people the physical side of his extraterrestrial upbringing, Heinlein focuses on the spiritual side of things. Mike Smith, the main character, is introduced to religion early on in the book and the remainder is about his time learning these concepts and putting his own spin on them.Heinlein explores many concepts in the book; from politics, to love, and as mention before, religion. I felt as if he didn't spend enough time on politics, however. The first portion of the book is about dealing with the government. They solve the issue rather abruptly and then nothing is ever really mentioned again in the remainder of the title. The plot he was following was rather good, in my opinion, and I really wanted to read more on the subject.Though the work is well written, it's a bit anti-religious, especially towards Christianity. The book was written specifically to challenge the mindsets of such institutions. Though I'm not exactly thrilled to read the author's take on spirituality, he wrote his thoughts and viewpoints in a way that kept this Christian interested to the end. So even if you don't fully agree with what he says, it's still a well executed plot. This is in my opinion the best book EVER written. I read it when I was 13, abit young for such books but I loved it. I though it was so touching. It made me cry. I highly recommend it to everyones who is exploring their spirituality. I liked Stranger in a Strange Land. I guess I take the bad with the good. Many people have written about the sexism, homphobia, and overbearing machismo of Heinlein's writing. I couldn't agree more. These flaws make it difficult to recommend this book, but I still do. What Heinlein does is ARTICULATE his ideas. He does this extermely well, making him more understandable than many sci-fi writers. Heinlein uses Jubal Harshaw to help make concrete sense of Mike's ideas, which are,(admit it), more sophisticated than \"free-love->sexism->fascism!\". The essential point of the book is easy to grasp, and although the pretense and arrogance of the author aren't much fun, any strong minded person need not feel threatened by these problems. The book is good for it's ideas more than its execution. Give it a chance. Quite simply, this is one of the top five books I have ever read. It is not often that I find a book that I can't put down. The great test of a book is its desire to be re-read. I'm on round 6 and counting. One of my favorite books ever. When I gave away my special copy, I bought this as a replacement, only to discover that it was the abridged version. So disappointing, as that was never indicated in the item description at the time (this may have changed since then). If you want the full version, look closely before you buy. It's worth reading the full version. I don't know how you could abridge such a wonderful book. While the ideas communicated in this book are fantastic (far beyond what people expect to find in things like the Celestine Prophesy and 1984, and Stranger combines these into one)RAH is overly preachy at times, and lets himself explain the ideas a little too much. I personally prefer books where the essence comes across through the action and hidden in the diaglogue instead of it being explained (such as Brave New World.) Still, the concepts are good enough that this book deserves a 9. Heinlein's \"masterpiece\" Stranger in a Strange Land starts off brilliantly. The first 100 pages or so comprise a well-paced absorbing thriller, and even up through the 200-page mark the story remains strong. And then the protagonist Valentine Michael Smith grows up and takes charge of his own life. And the whole novel falls flat on its face and remains thus for the remaining 250 pages.You see, in the beginning Michael is innocent and somewhat helpless. So he's powerless against his enemies and I naturally rooted for him. Then he slowly began to use his superhuman powers and I became even more absorbed and thrilled, watching him shake off his foes and emerge unscathed. Then he took asylum in a large secured residence with the evil government of the U.S. bent on capturing him and using him for their own ends. Could it get any better, I asked? This was five-star material.Unfortunately, that's the climax of the story and it comes less than halfway through. The rest is supremely mediocre. Mike becomes a god on earth due to his invulnerability and wealth. What does he do with this status? He basically uses his powers to establish a large harem and teaches others how to do the same thing. The only interesting character in this whole charade is Jubal Harshaw, who probably represents Heinlein himself and his opinions on various matters of philosophy, sex, religion, etc. Two stars here.Average: three and a half stars but I'm knocking it down to an even three due to the unsatisfying ending. I just finished Stranger in a Strange Land yesterday and I don't beleive I'll ever think quite the same way. I found it to be one of the most inspiring, yet totally truthful books I have ever read. Though it is intimidatingly long, (especially for teenagers like myself) it seems not nearly long enough once you finish it. I could hardly put it down! I would love to discuss the book with anyone who is reading this review. My e-mail is LilGrape25@aol.com. If you have not yet read this masterpiece, I hope you enjoy it. Bought this as a Christmas present for a teen nephew. Trying to inspire another generation of readers. Anything by Heinlein is awesome. For almost six months it's sat in the back of the closet, collecting dust and fallen winter coats. Even now we wish we didn't have to use it, especially given the high risk of aggravating our seasonal allergies. Alas, we are left with little choice. Pardon us for a second while we retrieve our abnormally large SOAP BOX. Actually, this might take more than a second....Born to humans, yet nurtured almost entirely by Martians on the planet (you guessed it) Mars, Valentine Michael Smith arrives on planet Earth to a whole lot of fan fair and speculation. Almost immediately he's thrust into a massive government conspiracy involving inheritance and possible ownership of the infamous red planet. Fortunately, Mike is befriended by a couple individuals that help him navigate his celebrity status along with the tricky legal waters. It also turns out that Mike has some pretty nifty brain superpowers that turn out to be quite useful. If only Mike can secure his freedom, the world could be his playground.What started as a very interesting story about blackmail, kidnapping, and the cultural differences between earth and mars, digressed into a diatribe against religion and well... religion. The first half of Stranger in a Strange Land was seriously intriguing (top 5 science fiction ever potential) and then, as soon as Mike goes on his journey of self-exploration the train derailed. We may be spoiling the plot here a bit, but we blame it on the whole soap box thing. With an endless supply of cash, what does the Martian decide to do? Yep, join the traveling circus, and when that doesn't work out so well, he decides that his female companion should become a showgirl out west. We're not judging, but really?Now, let's take a moment to discuss a newly invented and frequently used word within Stranger in a Strange Land. Merriam-Webster's definition of GROK is \"to understand profoundly and intuitively.\" Mike the Martian introduces this word and uses it regularly. He even goes so far as to suggest that people of the earth do not have the ability to grok anything because they don't have the mental capacity to do so. Yet, near the end of the book his close circle of friends seem to grok everything without hesitation. This might seem like a little thing, but for some reason this word really aggravated us by the end of the novel.Finally, we liked the fact that Stranger in the Strange Land challenged so many cultural norms, and as Christians, some of the criticism directed at established religion was fair and understandable. But then everything got all muddled up with the advocating of free love, the glorification of pornography, and some of the demeaning attitudes towards woman. By the end it felt like Heinlein was trying to punch holes in so many hot issues that even his credible arguments eventually lost all credibility. More importantly they lost our interest.Whew, now we're starting to sweat, which means it time to be done. In summation, we did not grok this novel nor do we grok its widespread appeal. For it's time I could see why it started such a stir, but it wasn't the mind altering experience I thought it would be. A good read if you can pick it up for free, but I don't know I'd buy my own copy. This novel impressed me with the immense quantity of entertaining dialogue. The eccentric and wealthy Jubal is my favorite character from any work of fiction. His discussions with the man from Mars and other characters are smart and fun. The author was way ahead of his time in many views held by this character. Jubal is Willie Wonka mixed with Don Draper.That said the book suffers from an overbearing amount of chauvinism. Some of this is possible to dismiss or even enjoy in a quaint fashion. While the women may appear subservient and stupid they are often really running things, advancing faster, and achieving greater levels of freedom and acceptance. It still comes off as disparaging which is a shame since it distracts from the enjoyment.Ultimately the book goes the way of so many potentially good works of science fiction. Religion. This unfortunate again and through much of the last third or quarter of the book I just wanted it over with. Jubal was all that kept me going.As a whole the book remains an enjoyable read if only for how dated some aspects have become. Great read! Loved the the subject matter. Recommend to anyone. This was Heinlein's flower power book. Promoting his view of sexual freedom (all males have this pipe-dream - I do). I suspect much of the popularity was adolescent guys reading it and saying, &quot;This is great, he actually wrote down the way life and sex should be!&quot;Otherwise an interesting but not enthralling story that moves at a leisurely pace due to the long pontifications of the characters. In Heinlein's later books this tendency to pontificate gets worse especially in &quot;Fear No Evil&quot; and &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;. A spectacular exception is &quot;Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; - which I give 5 stars.Michael Valentine is a Christ figure for some, but there is nothing really new in this story. As a fanciful philosophy book it would get 4 stars.In spite of the tenor or my review, I believe Robert A. Heinlein is THE master science fiction writer of all time I believe - don't read this one first - all the others are better. -- I practically memorized &quot;Have Space Suit, Will Travel&quot; as a high school student, and I believe &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is one of the top 10 science fiction novels of all time. Read those. I read this book first when I was 14. It blew me away. I've read it many times since and when the expanded version was printed I bought that and read it too.Many years later I can see elements in the book that I totally missed as a younger reader.I also know a lot more about Heinlein and know that he never intended to start a new religion, endorse cannibalism or advocate living in extended family type communes....he was just trying to get people to really think about elements of our world that we take for granted. Valentine Michael Smith is born on Mars and brought up by Martians who give him special, mystical skills. When he returns to Earth as an adult he is seeing our world from a unique viewpoint; that of a human who is not aware that he is a man. His innocent queries and problems point up some of the flaws and false values of modern society. His solutions are not meant to be taken literally but just to make us think. Heinlein was good at that.... There are some that haven't read this book. Luckily if you're reading this you are already interested. Great plot, great writing and a true classic. Go on and read it! I had heard good things about this book, and at first I was impressed. The story concerns a man who is encountering human culture through a completely unique viewpoint - that of the Martian mind. That has huge potential for all sorts of interesting observations about the way we live our lives. I loved reading about people trying to explain all the nuances of human life and human interactions to Smith, because it forces you to stop and try to think for yourself how you could explain, for example, a televangelist to a man who doesn't understand what religion is.But the place Heinlein goes with the book is disappointing. It would be enough for Smith to encounter the world, learn about it, pass on his unique viewpoint and change the people around him for the better. Instead, fortuitously inherits huge sums of money, and he has all sorts of crazy magical powers of the mind, like telekenesis, telepathy, and the ability to \"disappear\" things. He uses his money and powers to sway people towards his point of view, which is that everybody would feel a lot better about life if we would all love each other and have lots of indiscriminatory sex. He then becomes a new Christ-figure, in my interpretation rather pointlessly sacrificing himself for his new \"church\". The book left me with the sour taste of squandered potential. I hated this. I've loved other heinlein's, and rarely hate anything. The portrayal of women really bothered me (*lots* of references/jokes about cooking dinner & sex).Portrayal of a free-sex society was interesting.Several negative mentions about gay-ness, and while I should write this off to the atmosphere the book was written in, it still really bothered me.Dragged a lot. Obvious ending. Frustratingly over-powered alients, in terms of plot.Sorry if my review offends anyone for whom this is their fav book :) When I read the other online reviews here after just starting this novel I got kinda confused. I have heard from Sci Fi fans all over that this is one of the greatest novels ever and the first half of this book I could not put down. But unfortunately about that halfway mark the book bogs down and never fully recovers. The first few hundred pages are exciting, intriguing, and entertaining, while the second half meerely gets into a whole religious spin and the characters really become nothing more than annoying. I could barely finish this book and that upset me since it started so well. It is rare to see this in a single novel but very normal in say a trilogy. Alas though the book is worth it for the first few hundred pages alone and if you are looking to catch up on some Sci Fi classics you have to start here. It is an enjoyable read and relatively short. This is one of the best books I have read, of any genre. Usually, I don't read sci-fi, and I wouldn't classify this novel as a sci-fi novel, but my mom thought I might like to read it. Being on a camping trip with nothing else to do, I gave it my full attention, and soon found that I loved it.Everything Heinlein expresses in this book is just amazing, and makes you think about your life, and the messed up world we live in. He promotes free sex, cannibalism, and other \"immoral\" things, but presents them in humorous and thought provoking ways, so they seem innocent, and almost right. This \"twisted\" view of the world is what I loved the most about this book.Unlike other people, I don't think Heinlein is \"bashing organized religion\". Mike's \"thou art God\" bit is basic (even though it may not be obvious) stuff from almost every religion. The Fosterite church is supposed to be a farce, and copies some notorious religious groups, but Mike bases his own religion partly on it, letting us accept these radical beliefs (this is my point of veiw as an atheist).My favorite point to ponder in the whole book is why we laugh. After I read the section where Mike realizes why humans laugh, i had to put the book down to think, and I didn't find many situations humorous for days afterwards.Jubal is probably my favorite character in fiction, with his stright-forward, pragmatic views on everything. For some inspiration, read the section where Ben and Jubal talk about some of Rodin's sculptures.The only faults I found with this book were the total change in plot tone from the first part of the book to the second part, which might throw some readers off, and the 2-dimensions of some of the characters. The philosophies and points to ponder are the true stars of this book, though, which is why it's become one of my favorite books, the first one I usually recommend. I'm on my third time in 2 months through it, and still going! Despite it's inherent sexism, homophobia, and somewhat rambling philosophical passages, Stranger is still one of the best books I have ever read. It makes you think, it challenges your worldview, and, most importantly, it entertains. Who of us does not wish they could grok a wrongness and send it into another dimension? Who doesn't want to learn Martian? More than a dozen years have passed since I found a worn paperback copy in the Staurt, Florida library, but I can clearly remember the vivid characters and ideas. This is a book at allows you to think outside the box. Anyone who doesn't understand should treat themselves to a read.I'm no sci-fi fanatic. I've never watched a complete episode of any version of Star Trek, I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies, and I quickly lost interest in two of Heinlein's other books. This is not a little-green-come-to-earth story. It is, instead, a medium that allows you to look with your nose and see with your toes. Conventional thinkers will be bored and confused.I've read it twice and will listen to the audible.com version when I get my monthly credits The book does an excellent job an examining modern day society and putting it in terms an alien would understand.The ideas that the alien brings are interesting and decidedly cheery on a better planet. While the book maintains a steady pace of things getting better the book had an awful ending. The only reason I didn't rate it lower on that account was that I'm not sure if the author was trying to make a specific point about death that I just don't understand. Either way I think someone else could and the book is certainly worth your time.The audio-version is great as Jubil literally makes the book. Other reviews are far better than mine. For some reason I was thinking about this book today and found it on Amazon and wanted to show my support by rating it. I have the one with the red cover. Before I read this, I typically read assigned reading or a Stephen King book to fall asleep to. It was given to me by a friend for Christmas. I tossed it aside for a long while before I felt terribly guilty. From the minute I began reading this, I couldn't put it down. I literally would read this even as I showered. It was all I could think about for a very long time. I've never re-read anything, but I think I will re-read this book. Definitely one of the most treasured gifts that anyone's ever given me. A great many people have read Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND since it was first published in 1961--but while almost everyone enjoys the story, very few seem to actually get the point or indeed even understand what the novel is.The story concerns Valentine Smith, a child born during Earth's first and failed attempt to establish a colony on Mars. The child is raised by Martians and absorbs Martian civilization, teachings, and training as if he were of the race. When a later expedition discovers Smith, he is \"rescued\" and returned to earth--and promptly begins a series of adventures that would put Voltaire's CANDIDE to shame.Given the novel's premise many have described it as science fiction, but it is really nothing of the kind; futuristic concepts play only minor roles in the construct and imaginings based on science are more minor still. In fact, STRANGER IN A STRANGER LAND is essentially a satire, and like CANDIDE it focuses upon avarice, power, ignorance, and hypocrisy--and religious hypocrisy in particular.In short order Smith is kidnapped by the government that claims to have \"saved\" him--and becomes a pawn in a series of political power plays designed to strip him of both his legal rights and his inherited wealth for the benefit of the status quo. No sooner does Smith escape this ordeal than he finds himself plunged into organized religion of the most vulgar description imaginable, complete with slot machines in the narthex, bar service in the sanctuary, and a stripper in every corner.Unable to comprehend the motives of man, Smith goes underground in an effort to more fully understand the race--and after an unexpected turn emerges as a quasi-religious figure himself, preaching a philosophy that merges Martian and Earthly thought. But Smith proves all too human and is no more immune to human vices than those whose vices he seeks to correct, and the twin demons of government authority and religious fanaticism soon rise up to meet him.Changing mores have left STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND with a slightly dated feel, and in some respects it reads as slightly sexist and faintly homophobic. Even so, the unfolding plot, the memorable characters, and Heinlein's bold style command attention; it is a page-turner if ever there was one. And the novel's razor-like derision of man's social inventions remains as bitterly comic--and as bitterly compelling--as ever. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer Hardly a science fiction novel as advertised, the much-adored/abhorred 1961 novel Stranger In A Strange Land is a didactic exercise against man's ignorance and narrow-minded and terrestrial tunnel vision. Undefiled and unencumbered by environmental prejudice osmosis, Valentine Michael Smith returns to earth and is immediately feared and revered - by the establishment and ordinary folk respectively. The course is not hard to predict hence. The ideas and the rage against human doctrines are.Heinlein preaches heavily and at will, while the book shows its age; the points made though are still valid and topical. \"God is in all of us\" and religion is nothing more than a collection of charlatans and shysters. The sexual references, towards the end, are controversial to this day yet mostly on target.And, no surprise, mankind targets the messenger when medium and target collide. and yes, very sexist. But it's a blast watching Jubal Harshaw backhanding an oppressive world government, and Heinlein has some interesting philosophical points to make. Despite it's popularity with the counter-culture, this isn't a book for hippies; it is, in fact, kind of the libertarian answer to books like Jonathan Livingston Seagull, even though both books kind of get to the same philosophical place from opposite ends.Ah well. It's difficult to describe a book like this. If sexism really bothers you, then don't bother with this, it will just annoy or enrage you. (Heinlein got better at it in later books). But if good ideas and contrarianism appeals to you, by all means, read it. Everyone else has already gone over the plot of this book ad infinitum et ad nauseum. I don't think I need to rehash it for you, do I? No? Thank you. Bearing in mind that Heinlein never intended to found a new religion with this book (although he inadvertantly did so anyway, and the Church of All Worlds still exists today), let me offer a few opinions.As a woman in her late twenties, I do not find Heinlein's literary vision of love without jealousy to be merely &quot;an adolescent geek-boy's fondest dream.&quot; It is also my dream. I have seen entirely too many friendships end and too many perfectly good relationships messed up because we confuse lovers and spouses with property. The sexism in this book (NOT misogyny, an entirely different animal) did disturb me somewhat, but this book was written in the fifties -- what did you expect, a Bible of political correctness?As a religious person I don't see where Heinlein badmouths any religion, even Christianity. I do see where he questions religious conventions. I could understand how conservative types might mistake that for badmouthing, though. I know they think their teachings should be accepted mindlessly...I do see an underlying message in this book which most of you have missed, but which you may be assured the young people of the Sixties did not miss. And that is: Cultural perceptions are shaped by language. Religion may be seen as a language, because aside from speech it is one of the earliest societal conventions taught to most of us, even earlier than formal schooling, and it shapes our cultural perceptions just as language does. The logical answer for anyone wishing to shape our culture in a different direction is to teach a different language or, barring that, a different religion. (Valentine Michael Smith did both, with stunning results.) I suspect that's the biggest reason you will continue to see negative reviews here from conservative Christians and cultural elites: consciously or unconsciously they understand this message and they are threatened by it.Smith explained to Hershaw that what he was teaching really wasn't a religion. I would have to disagree. He was getting people back in touch with their Divine nature, which is the very heart of the entymology of the word &quot;religion&quot; -- &quot;religare,&quot; &quot;to re-link [with the Divine].&quot; As such he empowered all who would listen to his message. Hardly the sort of behavior one would expect from a fascist.Yes, I would highly recommend this book. Unless you are afraid of people making you think, in which case I recommend you trip on over to the music area and purchase Britney Spears' entire music catalog... There is no question that Robert Anson Heinlein is one of the Fathers of Science Fiction. There is also no question that STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is his most famous work, having been called \"the most famous science fiction novel ever written.\" Is it his best? Perhaps not. But it is a ground breaking classic, one that I enjoy reading again and again.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the story of Valentine Michael Smith (Mike), a male born of human parents on the first Earth colony ship to Mars. Literally born as the ship landed on Mars, Mike's parents and the rest of the crew died, and Mike was raised by Martians. 25 years later, a second Earth colony ship lands on Mars, and discovers Mike, the native inhabitants of Mars, and a host of unanswered questions. Mike returns to Earth, and STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the detailed chronicle of his introduction to, interaction with, and transformation of human culture.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was Heinlein's first truly adult science fiction novel, and he took on some pretty heady topics. Politics, religion, sex, equality, and the concept of a truly un-human culture (which happened to be superior), to name a few. Heinlein wove these themes into STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, each of which contributed to his idealistic vision of a perfect world.He intermixed shock value, logic, and plain good storytelling to get his points across, and I think he did so quite wonderfully.1. Religion. Heinlein was not an atheist, as some have claimed. He did believe in a higher power; what he did not have any use for was organized religion. He believed in faith. If you had faith, true faith, then the trappings of religion were unnecessary and superfluous. They just did not matter. The Church of All Worlds in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was set up to show that no matter what the religious trapping were, it was faith that really mattered. He also created a religion where happiness and self-belief were the main drivers, rather than fire, brimstone, and fear. Makes great sense to me.2. Sex. Contrary to popular belief, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND did not promote promiscuity or free love. What Heinlein did was to create a world where people were open about sex, where it was enjoyable and exciting, but with it came great responsibility. In this world, sex wasn't hidden, secret, or naughty; rather it was honest and pure and fun. People who could develop this utopian attitude became happier, healthier, less jealous, more caring, and, yes, more sexual. Responsibility to partners, offspring, and an entire extended family became the norm. In his own way, by exploring sexuality, Heinlein was exploring and redefining the meaning of family. He was also trying to define sex as a miraculous union, and to show that humans should treat it as the miracle of bonding and \"growing closer\" that it is.3. Equality. Before the sexual revolution and equality for women, Heinlein clearly believed in equality of the sexes, equality of the races, equality of faiths...basically the equality of all humans. Yes, he felt women should be treated with respect and reverence and be protected and nurtured because they gave birth and perpetuated the species, but he clearly believed that they were intelligent and capable. He also believed that women had sexual needs equal to those of men and had the right to pursue those needs.4. Politics. In STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, Heinlein clearly had little use for government, politics, or politicians. He believed that government in general was a necessary evil, but preferred that it be kept small and out of his business. He didn't care what it was based on or what guided it - astrology was the ridiculous example used in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - as long as it left him alone. Works for me. He also had little use for entitlements, and expected human beings to work for what they received. Again, works for me.5. Un-Human, Superior Culture. Heinlein did a remarkable and revolutionary thing when he created the Martian culture of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. The Martians of this novel are clearly not humanoids from another planet. They do not think like humans, act like humans, look like humans, reproduce like human, live like humans, or do anything like we do here on the planet Earth. There is nothing remotely recognizable about these Martians; they are completely alien. We can't them, and they can't understand us. They are older, more advanced, and can perceive the universe around them in ways that humans do not. But humans can, if properly taught, learn some of the things that Martians do. What a marvelous concept.In 1962 the original version of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND won the Hugo Award for the Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year. After Heinlein's death in 1988, his wife Virginia discovered the original uncut manuscript and arranged to have it published in 1991. It is interesting to read the two books side by side, to see the differences, and to compare them. I enjoy both versions very much, and am still not sure which is my favorite. Whatever version you choose, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. Whether you have read it before or not, whether you love it or not, you will find it to be an interesting and thought-provoking read. This book is absolutely amazing. Draws you in from the very first page, and after reading it, it leaves you with no questions, but a very insightful look into human nature.Once you pick it up you will find it hard to put it down to do things like sleep or go to work. Once upon a time, in a land far far away, a written language was created soon to be followed by the first fictional story by the first novelist. In these days, long before television and the movies, but long after the introduction of the play and theater the novel was a shared experience. The author would set the stage and introduce the players and provide his audience of one with a framework in which to develop his or hers own ideas about what was important, and to take those words in the context they were presented and broaden their horizon and plumb their greater depths. Like the theater authors wanted each individual to get something different from the words between the covers.Perhaps it is TV, perhaps it is the cinema, perhaps it is the desire to convert, quickly and easily the written word into one or other of these forms, but readers today do not seem to want to do as much thinking about things. Everything must be so literal, everything must be fully questioned and answered or the content is discarded as valueless.When I first read this book, it made me ask questions, I was young, unwise, and needing as much to ask the questions as find the answers. My most recent reading had me answering questions that were asked by the book, answers that, whilst being uncomfortable at times,helped me look around me a little more closely and gain a better understanding of my world. I did not get all the answers, nor, I suspect, were all the answers I got correct; but I got something.I do not like to fault a book for being written in another time and place, there are always truths that apply throughout both, and although this book does not reach 2010 unscathed by the passing of time it still carries with it the ability to make the reader think far beyond the themes espoused in works purporting to be the philosophical treatise of our time.I recommend this book to those who have the time to give it some time and mind to give it some mind. But if you want a quick and easy read that stimulates the heart but flutters inconsequently across the brain, skip it; it is not for you. If you haven't read any of Heinlein's works, this is a good place to start, his most famous piece of work. Having dabbled in other sci fi offerings, I am convinced that Heinlein is the best and that second place is a long way behind.Perhaps it is because he really is only a sci fi writer by viture of the settings that his stories take place, but don't be fooled, he isn't really writing about space ships and technology.Take away a few of the props and the Stranger in a Strange Land could just as well be someone from a distant land with a different way of seeing the world.As it is with Heinlein's later works, this book is great because the characters are real hero's, larger than life and they say and do things that we the reader often wish we could say and do. Heinlein's social commentary is great, even when you find yourself at odds with his conclusions.Heinlein's one fatal flaw is his cynicism, my guess would be that he could't bring himself to even dance with the notion that there might exist a benvolent God in the universe and it clouds his thinking and writing. It becomes more apparent in this work after having read many more of his works and then coming back to this for a second read.But that isn't to say his views aren't important and well spoken, even as a Christian and opposed to his overall world view, I find this book a great read and making important points along the way. This story is as relavent today as it was when it was published.We live in a society where moral values are dictated by authority. We are told that things are bad or evil, even if they are unharmful to others.Like much of Heinlein's work, this story is very strong in the first 75% and loses some steam in the end, where he injects the plot with bizarre developments and handwaving. However, the anti-establishment theme resounds many years after putting the book down.Pick up this book, and read it, and keep reading it until you grok it. What is there one can add to the other 200+ reviews of this novel? Well, being somewhat of a Heinlein fanatic, I feel that I should clear up many of the misconceptions that I see in these reviews. Most of the problems that many people seem to have with &quot;Stranger&quot; is that it is dated, chauvanistic, or overly wordy. Well, the first thing I should deal with is the last problem; if you don't like dealing with an author that has an extremely lucid perspective on human society and tries to use literature as a medium for bringing about social change, do not read this book, or anything by Heinlein. If, on the other hand, you accept this as one of the purposes of literature, READ EVERYTHING BY HEINLEIN THAT YOU CAN! The next conception I will deal with is the impression that it is dated. My only answer is that one who says this must be working off the prejudice that it was a book of the sixties. In fact, &quot;Stranger&quot; was written in 1957 and did become the basis for much of the sixties scene. However, the characters and the society are as up to date as &quot;Dilbert.&quot; Also, for some reason people seem to see this work as being chauvanistic. On the contrary, this novel, like all of Heinlein's work, treats females with great respect and portrays them as strong characters. True, many of the females appear to take subordinate roles, but in fact they are all much stronger female characters than I often read in today's literature. So they don't go out and assert themselves as utterly masculine, feminazis...What Heinlein's female characters do is use their gifts to manipulate the men around them, as they were truly brilliant, yet still utterly feminine characters. No GI Jane here, only Cleopatra. Which do you prefer? One passed boot camp, the other manipulated the greatest leaders of Rome to protect her nation. All in all, this ranks as one of the best novels, science fiction or otherwise, of the twentieth century. I truly believe that Heinlein will (or at least should) go down as one of the greatest novelists of the twentieth century. Whereas conflict may be a hard-to-grok human concept for Robert Heinlein's Man from Mars--the hero of his 1960's sci-fi classic, Stranger in a Strange Land--in fiction it is essential. In writing this novel Heinlein has forgotten a most important rule--that conflict is the driving force of any good piece of fiction. Because of this oversight Stranger in a Strange Land comes to a sad and screeching halt after Michael is kidnapped/rescued from the hospital by Jill. Once he is safely lodged at Jubal's home the conflict between him and Earth's powers-that-be takes a backseat, the tension becomes slack, the plot meanders, boredom ensues. And this only 60 some pages into the novel!Even the events that occur after Mike and Jill leave Jubal's nest are devoid of conflict: their unsuccessful career as circus performers, the burning down of their &quot;church,&quot; the predictable crucifixion of Mike by the angry mob. None of these events seem to matter to any of the charcaters and so can't possibly matter to the reader. There's no tension and thus no opportunity for catharsis. The reader is left feeling empty and unfulfilled.Even more unfortunate is that the provocative and insightful ideas that Heinlein tries to convey about communication (human and otherwise) and about relations between beings (human and otherwise) are hopelessly bogged down in this muck of non-action. Heinlein, in using fiction as a vehicle for these thoughts, has forgotten the importance of keeping that vehicle moving forward, ever forward.I suppose some readers will try to defend Stranger in a Strange Land along more clever lines--that Heinlein perhaps purposefully crafted a seemingly aimless plotline to mirror the Martian concept of &quot;waiting is.&quot; I have no idea if this was Heinlein's intention or not, but as a human reader geared for drama I found Stranger in a Strange Land a slow-moving disappointment. A little dated in its hippie-gone-futuristic philosophy, but a powerful look at the nature of religion, science, and society. A human raised by Martians (who are never 'on camera', and you only learn of them through the main character) returns to Earth, and has to adjust to how our world works. Alternately an experimental subject, cult leader, and philosopher, it's a look at how an otherwise intelligent person would react to \"us\" if he \"unlearned\" all of the things we're taught by virtue of being amongst one another, and started over. It has a certain reverse-Tarzan appeal- someone who was raised in a society presented as superior to ours (free of violence, hatred, etc.), suddenly a fish out of water. Heinlein is almost too brutal on organized religion, but the jabs (and roundhouses) he takes are as valid today as they were when he wrote this. Wow this book really dragged on. I found it really tedious, and almost didn't bother finishing it. I've read a lot of SciFi and his seems to fall in the pulp area. I read and enjoyed starship troopers and figured I'd give this one a try as it is supposed to be a 'classic'. I was really disappointed.The characters all just mill around this central god like figure with very little direction, feel for the rest of the world, or reader interest. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Do a search on a different author, there is lots of better books out there. I've never read the \"non-uncut\" version of this novel but I love this one! Robert Heinlein is one of the great sci-fi authors and this story is a shining example of his greatness. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" became a bestseller when it was published in 1961. Now it is considered a science fiction classic. I must admit that the book's revered status is a complete mystery to me. I've searched reviews and essays for some insight, and I have yet to find an explanation of what readers find meaningful in this book. As the story goes, Valentine Michael Smith was the sole survivor of the first manned mission from Earth to Mars. Born and raised on Mars, by Martians, he was discovered as a young man by the second manned mission to Mars. Brought back to Earth, Michael knows nothing of human ways so is at the mercy of people who may be more concerned with his substantial inheritance than with his well-being. When a flirtatious nurse named Jill Boardman fears for Mike's safety, she absconds with him to the home of iconoclastic Renaissance man Jubal Harshaw, where Mike receives an eccentric education in humanity.I can understand why \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" made waves in 1961. Its advocacy of \"free love\" presaged the sexual revolution and shocked the sensibilities of the post-War bourgeoisie. But controversy does not imply profundity. Mike's radical sexual mores seem either silly or simply irrelevant today. The book portrays sex as passionless communion anyway. It could hardly be less appealing. I don't know what Heinlein might be trying to say beyond this critique of conventional social mores, but Jubal is always made to articulate Heinlein's ideas through dialogue. Jubal's conversations are little more than a patchwork of treatises. That's just bad writing. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" was edited down to 160,000 words before it's original publication. The version I read was the \"uncut\" 220,000-word manuscript, which has a lot of extraneous material and fails to create any dramatic tension after Part One. If the shorter version isn't better, it would at least be breezier. I first read this book while in college, around 1970. It was one of my favorites back then. It became even more fascinating when I read, somewhere, that it was read by Charles Manson as a &quot;how-to&quot; bible. (Manson's bizzarre story does parrallel this in many ways.So, if you want to get an understanding of where Charles Manson got his inspiration, read this book.Re-reading it was still fun. 30 years had erased most of my memories of the details, so it was a fun read. But this time it didn't feel quite as smooth, and it felt a bit too overtly didactic and preachy. I don't mind a story with a message. but this one comes on a bit too thick sometimes. Of course you get the same thing from loads of other authors. Overall, this should be considered one of the all-time classics of Science fiction, with the Foundation Series, Ringworld, 2001, to name a few. Some people seem to point out obvious contradictions in this old masterpiece of science fiction, such as:Mars is known to be devoid of life. These self appointed critics fail to observe the metaphor behind the whole story. It does not really matter where the planet is, or which it is. It's the storie's implications that matter. Suspend your belief in modern facts and the \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" can remain a masterpiece in any era. I'm reading this for class and i think its a lovely book, but i just like the first few parts. After they join the carnival its just meh.. funny book though! SIASL is one of the best books I've ever read. It is not only humorous, but has many theological and philosophical comments and ideas. It prompts thought, and it prompts the reader to look at themselves... I read this book on a whim (after reading Job: A Comedy of Justice), and found it to be one of my all-time favorites. Valentine Michael Smith is not /too/ good, not /too/ bad- he's human...With commentary on politics, media and hypocrisy (just note the prescient view on media vultures!), it's a great book for curling up- Especially if you can read books for their ideas, and not assume they were all written last month :) I heard about this book from several colleagues (I am a computer geek) and felt it was one of those books I had to read to say I had read it (and knew what &quot;grok&quot; meant). I ended up liking this book, although I am not normally a science fiction fan. I read the long version, which tends to drone on in places, but all in all, well worth the time it took to read this book. I can't believe I managed to finish reading this tripe. Basically as others have said, the first half was an intriguing idea. The second half however shows what a simplistic world view Heinlein had.The Plot: Basically martian man begins a Scientology/Branch Davidians cuasi-socialist-cult where everybody melts into one entity and becomes happy by freeing their mind and having sex, lots of sex. Who gives a (blip) anyway. All this is explained in long-winded conversations where one idiot makes a comment only to be refuted by an all wise sage, and the sage is never wrong.Boring, boring, boring as hell. If Heinlein had any sense of irony he would have seen that martian man's cult was utter stupidity and would have made fun of it in the last half.Don't buy this book, get something that matters. Stranger in a Strange Land is one of the most famous science fiction books of all time, and well deserves its place there. With impeccable humour and a running thread of cautionary philosophy, it brings the world of Michael Valentine, the Man from Mars, home to everyone who reads it. By the end you're longing to become a character in the novel, even if it's just to argue the ethics of cannibalism or watch a python babysit . . . A fine and remarkable book. I can't suggest it too much. The clockwork of society analyzed though the novel eyes of a complete stranger. My review concerns the \"extended\" or \"uncut\" version released posthumously. \"Stranger\" starts as a very clever story about a man who was raised by martians on Mars and returns to Earth as a young adult. The \"Man From Mars\" is soon discovered to be wealthy beyond belief, but because of his Martian upbringing has no grasp of personal property or interpersonal relations. As the world government bears down on him, a group of unlikely people come together as his salvation.Now, I loved the book up to this point. But Heinlein has a tendency to drastically change a book halfway through and in my opinion, this one changes for the worse. At one point, Michael is at the zoo and he \"groks\" (fully understands) humans. From this point on this book becomes a commercial for living in a nudist commune having wanton \"free love\" sex with everyone you see and never worrying about tedious stuff like money. (Whoa, far out, man. pass the joint.)If you've read any other Heinlein, you might get a little deja' vu when he brings up subjects such as religious pluralism, cannibalism, and free love. Heinlein used his books as a sort of soap box for his hippie ideals. If you can look past this, and forget the outdatedness of the science, there is a fairly good read here. Especially the first half. Some of the things in this book are a little outdated...if not somewhat questionable in a realistic sense (as is communism which looks good on paper but has no practical application) but this does not detract from the brilliance of Heinlein. &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is a wonderfully told story about love and the beauty/tragedy of humanity. Heinlein's use of archetypes makes this book easy to relate to and, ultimately, a timeless treasure. I had read this book in highschool and it is still one of my favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the sci-fi genre but craves a more &quot;philosophical&quot; plot. I haven't read this since the seventies. Great memories. The political and religious ideas are still good today. The technologies are dated but it's always interesting to see what Heinlein thought the future might bring. Great audio recording. It's much easier to listen to than read. Well worth the small cost. I had read the edited version of this back in college and found it delightfully subversive, but recently I came across the unedited, original version...... and all I can say is, Thank god he had an editor. Otherwise, RH's writing career would have been DOA. The full 220,000-word magnum opus (over the more accommodating 160,000-word version) is incredibly sexist and at times downright misogynist. Women are at RH's characters' beck and call, while the idea of just a man touching another naked man -- even in a non-sexual way -- is cause for alarm and concern. It's almost as though the author didnt dare go too far with his own philosophy... not when his women were ever ready to hit the sheets or make the lunch or happily bounce in the pool for the enjoyment of their male benefactors.To call this science fiction's greatest achievement is an insult to the genre. It wants so desperately to be counter-culture, but it has real trouble with commitment issues when the opportunities afford themselves. The second half of the book is almost pointedly absurd -- the sexual aspect kicks into overdrive, sometimes in downright ridiculous ways. As for the satire side of things, the conflicts set up in the first half are roundly ignored or given little attention, and the resolution, while it may seem reasonable at first glance, does not stand any kind of deeper scrutiny.Paper-thin characters, didactic prose, incessant pontification... this isnt science fiction. This is bad Philosophy 101. Having not read it many years, I hope the edited version addresses this... but given how downright terrible the unedited one is, I'm not entirely hopeful. It is a classic. I enjoyed seeing how technology has changed in the last 50 years even religion and social behavior such as smoking.I have read this book several times since the first time I read it in 1970. I picked up this book after reading, and enjoying (once absolutely ADORING) some of his other works.Honestly, I had a hard time getting into it. Once I was into it I was underwhelmed for many of the reasons already stated here.If you've read this and no other Heinlein, pick up The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. This is absolutely one of my favorite books of all time and, in my humble opinion, a much better book. This true classic has meaning on so many levels; it is science fiction at its best. Interlocking storylines, characters with depth, and hidden messages abound. Many interpretations are possible, equally relevant. I read this book with my roommate as an undergraduate, then again and again, often with my children. Each reading leads to deeper understanding and new discoveries and perceptions. Valentine, my love, you are a part of me. I was bored within the first 50 pages. It arrived in excellent condition and in a timely fashion, to be used it's definitely in superb condition. I will try reading it again, it's just not my taste, has nothing to do with the book itself Right at the beginning of the `Flower Power Era' Robert Heinlein published this monumental work. It is monumental for a couple of reasons. It was one of the first SciFi works to make it into the `Best Seller' lists of non-SciFi ratings. It essentially broke that barrier forever. The book won Heinlein the 1962 Hugo and received more attention than some of his more solid SciFi works. The book was widely read by people in the beginning of the Vietnam protest, the drug culture (although Heinlein disapproved of any drug other than ethanol), and the `Tune In, Turn On, Drop Out' philosophy. For a few years it spanned a minor cultural movement and I must admit for a briefly embarrassing time my friends and I would say, \"Can you Grok that?\" rather than \"Do you understand?\" or even, \"Can you dig it?\" Fortunately or otherwise this did not last (unlike the even weirder work of L. Ron Hubbard) and no lasting harm was done.This Audio CD version seems to be based on the fabled `long' version. When Heinlein wrote this, it was well over 200,000 words. As originally published it was much less. I think everything is in here because I found myself wishing about half the time that it was over. You can never go home and it is probably better not to revisit something of your youth with high expectations. When I saw this Blackstone Audio `New Edition' I snapped it up with just those high expectations. Now the long, long, long dialogues (or diatribes) about love, sex, god, cannibalism, and such are more boring than uplifting.Having been critical I'd still recommend the Audio CD or the book (albeit the shorter version) and give it 5 stars. I do that because it is, in the best sense, a classic of SciFi and deserves your attention. Heinlein raised modern SciFi out of a sub-genre and into the mainstream. You can take or leave his philosophy, but he was one hell of a writer. This is one of those stories that will leave you awake at night asking yourself \"Is everything that I ever knew wrong?\". Its that challenging. Heinlein rightly deserves the mantle of \"Grand Old Man of Science Fiction\". Though this book does not necessarilly display his forte but his investigations of the human culture is most thought-provoking. Though it may seem from the other reviews that this book preaches a brand new philosophy, Ill tell you that it doesn't. Heinlein asks questions so obvious it makes you wonder why you never asked them yourself! The story challenges the basic fiber of \"culture\" and \"morality\" in a fashion that can only be deemed as \"innocent\". And these questions are the most provocative of all. A must read, not just for philosopher ... and soul-searchers, but for anyone who considers himself of open mind. This was one of the great books of our time.Hundreds of people refer to it....In one word. I grok! This book did not excite or interest it. I got about halfway lost my place and didn't feel like going back. Main problem was that I just didn't care about anybody in it. Valentine Michael Smith is the Man from Mars. He was the first human born on the red planet, his parents both crew members of the Envoy, an expedition thought lost seven years before a second vessel, Champion, followed. The crew of the Champion discovers that Mars is, in fact, inhabited and brings Valentine Michael Smith, Mike as he becomes known, back to Earth.Enter journalist Ben Caxton and nurse Jill Boardman who hatch a plan to free Mike from the hospital where he is kept under military guard. Jill manages to successfully liberate Mike (dressing him in drag as a nurse) and learns that by sharing water with him, she has become a \"water brother\". Doing so forms an almost unbreakable bond that if severed could cause Mike to willingly discorporate (which equates to dying in our limited human understanding).Grok that?But when Ben Caxton vanishes, and with the authorities on her trail, Jill turns to retired physician-lawyer turned loafer-writer Jubal Harshaw and his three lovely assistants, Dorcas, Anne, and Miriam (all of whom become Mike's water brothers). While staying with Jubal, Mike learns about life on Earth, women, politics, and most impressionably, religion.Meanwhile, the crafty Jubal strikes a deal with the military to leave Mike alone and in exchange, offers the Secretary General of the military power of attorney over Mike's apparent fortune (Mike is after all the heir apparent of Mars itself based an obscure law cited by Caxton and later, Jubal). The safe return of Caxton is also part of the deal. Soon, Caxton also becomes a water brother.Before finally striking out on his own, Mike attends a Fosterite religious service which is essentially a casino/church cult. With Jill at his side, Mike finally leaves the confines of Jubal's home, travels as a carnie magician, learns how to spot \"marks\" in a crowd, then eventually--and somewhat scandalously--starts his own cult using his training as a carnie, his experiences with the Fosterites, and his concept of bonding through the sharing of water.There are many details left out of this review. Stranger in a Strange Land is a challenging book to summarize. I also do not wish to reveal spoilers. While the book is a product of its time, especially in the way that women are treated (one of Jill's lines explicitly states that it's partly a woman's fault if she's raped), the story of Mike's evolution from a lost creature to a cult leader is astounding, told as only Heinlein can. I can see why this book became a favorite among the hippies in the sixties.All I can say for now is that I grok. Perhaps not in fullness, but waiting is. This novel is preachy. Preachy like a stoned hippy telling you how great it is to toke weed and how The Man's keeping you down. It's also shallow. Shallow in the sense that you never feel anything for any of the characters save for a mild irritation and vague hope that they'll all discorporate. It's also terribly dated. Dated in the sense that Heinlein failed to forsee ANY of our modern electric communications devices or space exploration programs. I wouldn't fault him for this - except that he's writing SCIENCE fiction.The solipsism required to embrace the philosophies of this book is staggering. Of course, in our modern morally relativistic society considering yourself to be the only arbiter of morality is lauded, but let's not kid ourselves here. That people tried to set up collectives based on Mike the Martian's kooky teachings is further proof of how drugged-out the '60s were.The dialog is hackneyed and the plot a thin excuse for delivery of nutty diatribes. And the scenes in \"heaven\" are mind-numbingly bad. Actually, it's almost worth reading the book just to see how bad. Almost.If you want Heinlein, skip this and read Starship Troopers. (No Spoilers) Robert A. Heinlein is considered among the most prolific science fiction authors of all time. He was one of the first to unleash science fiction to the mainstream world, and he broke boundaries that most authors of the time wouldn't dare to cross. Unfortunately, his counter culture and sexual revolution ideas are outdated in the modern era. In fact, portions of the book are misogynistic and offensive. I'd never read Heinlein before, and I give him a lot of leeway due to his era, but my inner feminist yelled at me while I read Stranger in a Strange Land.The book is about Valentine Michael Smith, the Man from Mars who is brought to Earth under odd circumstances and attempts to acclimate to society. Mike is a wonderful character, but the light really shines on Jubal, the lawyer/writer/philosopher who takes in Mike and becomes a surrogate father. I found myself able to empathize with Jubal, to understand and befriend him. Whereas I found Mike to be too alien. But perhaps that was Heinlein's point. The female characters in the book are one-dimensional or purely there so male characters have someone to fornicate with. I found nothing to attach me to the heroine, Jill, or the various other women.If you can get past the misogynist tendencies, you'll find Stranger in a Strange Land to be an eye opening novel about the human condition. Our hate for things different, our resistance to change, and our ability to blindly follow a crowd. Heinlein uses science fiction and his characters to touch on politics, religion, and sexual repression. Things that at the time of his writing were at the forefront of revolutionary thought. If nothing else, Stranger in a Strange Land demonstrates the roots of science fiction and how the pen can move to change the world. Just put a muzzle on your inner feminist and take it for what it is. (3 Stars) Not intending to be harsh, I did really enjoy this book and am glad I finally read it, but I'm having a hard time determing why this book has changed so many lives. Why do so many people list this book as the single book they would take with them if they were stranded on an island? The adaptive transformation of martian Michael Valentine Smith to his surroundings as the story progresses is fascinating, but the overall philosophy promoted is dated and flawed; dated in its representation of racial stereotypes and gender roles; flawed in that it only works by a select pseudo-religious group capitalizing on an outside world they consider to be \"marks.\" Stylistically speaking, I think the plot of this book moved much in the same way as any of the books by Ayn Rand. This is certainly not to say that the authors promote the same ideals, only to say that the highly nuanced mapping of their plot, and the use of characters to embody simplified ideals is similar.This is definitely a book to be read, especially as a guage for what good science fiction is capable of, and to understand it's cult status within the genre. I believe, however, that you can find better more subtle, thoughtful, and sensitive work out there by writers like Samuel Delany (\"Trouble on Triton\" springs to mind). The story of a Mike, man raised by Maritians who returns to earth and becomes a political pawn who turns the table with the help of his adopted &quot;father&quot; Jubal.For fun look up the meaning of the names Heinlein uses for his characters.Heinlein, the master story teller, takes us where no one else can. Into a world you want to be a part of.My reviews are usually verbose. But how can I compete with Heinlein, my idol?You should read this book. Over and over again. The lessons within are worth learning.Enjoy! I heard a lot about this book and had searched for it everywhere for a long time until i finally found it in a used book store, years after i first read about it. From what i had read, i expected something wonderful, but in my high expectations, my disappointment was all the more deeply felt. I have read Heinlein's other works and they were pretty okay ( but &quot;I will fear no evil&quot; was really a waste of paper but that's another story ), but since this was supposed to be his best work, i had to read it.What i found was another long winded yarn disguised this time as a sociology comment ( which I presume was shocking and sensational when it first came out but comes across now as pretty ordinary ). All through the book, i couldn't shake off the feeling of reading a book written in the 60's.... of watching a 60's B flick. The whole book feels so dated now that i was shaking my head in disbelief. Classics are supposed to be timeless, okay, granted that his commentaries on the nature of mankind is timeless, but the canvas that he paints it on certainly is not. In the end i had to soldier on to finish it as i had on a few occassions been close to quitting, failing to find any solid plot line to grope on.Frankly, I don't think Heinlein should be mentioned in the same breath as Asimov or Clarke as all his works seem unable to project themselves any further than the 1960s. Any commentary on the possible futures of humanity shouldn't be stuck with images of 60's sci-fi flicks that we see on tv. When I heard this was a sci-fi standard, I felt rather obligated to read it. But going through it, I just was not captivated. Oh, it was alright, to be sure, but I did not get the hoopla. Was it a trend setter pushing the boundary? Introducing socially controversial issues like sexuality? Part of the problem as well is that the original critically heralded book was way trimmed down from what I read. Researching this point I found there is a disagreement as to which is superior, that perhaps the cut version was actually superior.I'll check out another of Heinlein's books, I got a long list to go through first of other authors, I try to limit myself to only one author to get through as many different and diverse as I can, and having two sons certainly does not lend itself well to the situation.",

         "Michael J. Fox has been one of my favorite celebrities ever since I developed an almost unhealthy obsession with the Back to the Future movies when I was a kid. His book tells the fascinating story of his early life in a working class family in Canada, his uncertain move to Los Angeles in search of acting fame, and the spectacular way in which he achieved it.It's an enthralling tale of a young Canadian kid moving to the states with enormous dreams, struggling for years with steadily increasing failure, and then suddenly landing the roles that would earn his global fame.But I think the best thing about the book is the way he describes his struggles with alcoholism and Parkinson's disease. His long time fans will be fascinated by the stories he tells of his experiences as an international superstar, and but it's the determination and fortitude, as well as his unshakable dedication to his wife and family, that will endear most readers to him.I was particularly interested in his campaigning for stem cell research, and the way he supported any candidate for virtually any office - Republicans and Democrats alike - if they would support his cause. Also interesting is the attacks he suffered during his mission to help rid the world of his terrible disease. Of particular note is Rush Limbaugh accusing him of \"exaggerating\" his symptoms during a commercial to generate sympathy, which I guess Limbaugh doesn't think he, or the millions suffering from Parkinson's, deserves.I encourage you to look up the clip of Limbaugh's monstrous accusation, but also of Fox's response, which is astonishingly graceful. Rather than respond to Limbaugh's vicious idiocy with anger, as I surely would have, he answered him with understanding and humility. Forget about being a movie star, Michael J. Fox is surely one of the best people alive.He has three books out now. I read them all within a couple weeks, and I recommend them all highly. But this one remains my favorite. Bravo! Fantastic book and highly recommended with a poisitive message to his readers. You enjoy it tremendously. I would probably point more stars if I had the option to. So full 5 stars!Michael J. Fox is a unique and very talent guy. It was obvious when you watched him acting. And for my opinion, he is still considers as one of the best. He was fast pace and so natural. Never acted from other valance view point. Now that he allowed us to have an insight into his inner world, it was amazing to see what he could do to make things go right and to an end phenomena of a positive point despite his condition. He went into an extreme to entertain us, giving up his health. Which show how much his self determinism view, is so important and above all that he was willing to sacrifice his life. Currently he suffers phisically from PD but spiritually he never changed. The language he uses is literate and reading his book is very enjoyable, leaving us with a message of, no mercy, but \"one can always do something about it\".A person lives as long as he strives to help. When he stops, he dies. MJF never stopped contributing to others. Thus, and the Way I see it, his goal of his life wasn't just acting and finance himself. Otherwise we wouldn't continue hearing him to date being out there and communicate. He never rest despite his condition, but continue to operate as a free being. I wanted to read this book because someone very near and dear to me passed away after having been diagnosed with PD in the late 60's early 70's. It was my father. I was only 14 at the time and didn't really understand the disease. Thanks to Michael's book I now understand alot more of what my father went through.Thanks Michael!! As the wife of a Parkinson's patient, my husband and I are indebted to him for his work in this area of research for a cure. I also appreciated his apparent honesty in describing his life before and after his diagnosis. I had no idea what a person who has contracted Parkinson's disease, goes through. This book is such an eye opener. Even though it was a terrible blow for Michael and his family, it was so uplifting to read about the courage and strength of character shown by Michael J Fox. A really well written book which carries the reader along and feel involved.Certainly recommended. Reading this book feels like a conversation with Michael J Fox. Or at least what you think a conversation would be like with him. He gives a glimpse of his family relationships with mom, dad and grandmother. He also tells of his growing relationship with wife, Tracy. If you like reading biographies, this is a good and interesting one to read. I found Lucky Man to be very moving. I was so impressed that Michael J. Fox told his own story on audio. You could feel the pain, confusion and ultimately happiness through both his words and his voice. Excrusiating disease that he has had to deal with at such a young age...and he did it with great courage and focus. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Parkinson's Disease. He has done a great job explaining so many facet's of the disease. I would also recommend this to anyone who knows someone dealing with this disease. After everything, he considers himself LUCKY. This biography tells the story of a great man facing a terrible disease. This man, one of the leading actors of his generation, writes about his way to beat the fear and the uncertainty of life - but aren't we all living in uncentainty? Wonderful piece. I read the book in 2 days; couldn't put it down. Haven't seen the Back to the Future Series, nor much of Family Ties. However, Doc Hollywood(movie) is one of my favorites. How PD has changed his life, and the consequent choices that he and Tracy have made, was engrossing. Very well written and moving. I read this book only because I saw Michael J Fox on Charlie Rose. During the show, parts of the book were read out loud, and I just had to read the rest. Still, I really didn't know what to expect. Generally, I hate books written by celebrities, with or without ghost-writing help. I hate the \"look at me\" aspects of most of these books, the superficiality, the gloss.This book has none of those features. This is a book written by a man who has gone (and continues to go) through a series of wildly implausible adventures. From his early, almost accidental, startdom, through his marriage which has somehow defied all the odds for a Hollywood marriage, through his diagnosis with early-onset Parkinson's disease, nothing in this man's life could have been predicted.Michael J Fox has dived deep into his own psyche and come back to tell us what he found there. With compassion for himself and for the other people he has known in his life, he describes what it was like to be so successful, to experience fame as a drug (almost) that distanced him from some levels of reality, and then to have it all taken away. And he did it himself. This book was not ghostwritten, and the beauty of some passages makes it hard to believe that the author is not a professional writer. The fact that the prose was not mediated by a ghost-writer also makes the book more immediate and accessible.I do not have words to do justice to the honesty, the compassion, and the courage that I found in this book. All I can say is what I have been saying to people ever since I read it: \"I know, I know, it's a celebrity autobiography. Read it anyway.\" What a life!! Beloved son...Movie star...TV star...Parkinson's patient. I believe Mike is an outstanding man.Even with all his insecurities, he was able to rise above them and think about others (help others). And Tracy is the\"rock\" he needed to help him. this is indeed, an inspiring book to read. Thank you Amazon! I was completely immersed in this book. Micheal was very candid about his disease and his feeling throughout. He also is so inspiring in detailing the vulnerabilities and struggles he has faced. Great read! Like many others, I grew up with MJF in my home every week. He always has been one of my all time favorite entertainers. This book was everything that I had hoped for and more. I really appreciated his honesty, candor, humility, and wry humor, even in regards to himself.This book has all the fascinating behind the scenes info that people want to hear about from the Family Ties days and the movies, but Mike always finds a way to bring in the personal touches and balance the book out with his heart.This book is the perfect antidote and opposite to so many of these ghost written, polished &quot;biographies&quot; that come out. This was no arrogant movie star writing this book! Furthest thing from it!I literally couldn't put this book down when I started reading it. Among his many talents, he certainly can add writing to the list. I can easily recommend this book to everyone. People that don't like to read will after reading something like this.Thanks for taking the time to share all of this with us, Mike. The reason I am calling him Mike is because he feels like a friend of mine after all these years and especially after reading this book. I think a lot of us have felt that way. You certainly will after reading this book.I hope to see you in my home and in the theater again soon, Mike! Best Wishes and God Bless! Keep writing! This book was an unexpected treat. I loved. reading it and learned more about Parkinson's in a real life way. I look forward reading MJF's next book. I was impressed with the writing. Long-time fans of Michael J.Fox will have their feelings confirmed about what a genuine person he is and others will be won over by this book.Seemingly almost totally lacking pretension (is he the only person in Hollywood who doesn't think the world revolves around him?)and well aware of his flaws and faults, this book is a fascinating chronicling of his early film and TV days through to his battling of PD and being a vocal spokesman for research of same.Not full of dirt (which would have been out of character and unseemly)but he points fingers back at himself and reveals someone who, like every other human on the planet, has good and bad days, makes mistakes and isn't superhuman.I've been a fan of his since FAMILY TIES and the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies (ok, maybe NOT part 3)and can only say that after reading this book my thoughts are with him and his family while he battles PD.The book is called LUCKY MAN, but I think WE are the LUCKY ones for having someone like Fox around to inspire us. I'm still looking at the title page, the back of the dustjacket... anywhere, for the name of a co-author... but there isn't one. No, this is pure Michael J. Fox. As he says on the next-to-last page \"I knew from the outset that I would have to write this book myself. The story was too personal for it to be told in anyone's words but my own.\"It's just amazing that someone so skilled as an actor should be equally skilled as an author. His memoir is so well-written.I got it as a Christmas gift, and spent my holidays devouring it (in between actual turkey-feasts). Trust me, once you start reading the story, it's really difficult to put the book aside.As my review title suggests, Fox does not opt for a straight-ahead chronological approach to his story. Maybe it was even written in a DeLorean! He begins by detailing his earliest experiences with Young-Onset Parkinsons Disease in 1990, then jumps back in time to his formative years growing up in various parts of Canada (1960's-70's)... then follows up with his meteoric (albeit arduous) rise to fame in Hollywood in the early 80's and beyond. It's this latter three-quarters of the book that is filled with flashbacks, relevant happenings, here's and there's, like puzzle pieces selected not neccessarily in chronological order, but definitely neccessary for a complete picture in the end.The reader is never lost in this real-life maze, and Fox's skill as a writer can hardly be exaggerated. Some of the most moving sections are those which deal with his marriage to actress Tracy Pollan, to his battles with alcohol indulgence, his brain surgery in 1998, to his love for family (his real-life Family Ties)! Of course, Michael's behind-the-scenes (and in-front-of-the-scenes) struggle with Parkinson's is front and center as the main motivation for this memoir. [Incidentally, all author's profits from the book are being donated to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is yet another reason to pay the current Hardcover price!]The book is sobering, it is deadly serious, and yet it is every bit as witty as Fox's television and movie persona.In the last chapter, he says \"Illness is a scary business, and somewhere deep inside, or maybe not so deep inside, we're all wondering if it could happen to us, and how we would cope if it did.\"This book is about how Michael J. Fox copes. Gut level, it's all played out curtains and cameras aside!If you expect a depressing, downtrodden story, you will be disappointed. This is not the story of an unfortunate man. It's the story of a lucky man. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is a book that is nothing short of astonishing or as honest as the man who wrote it, Michael J. Fox. When I was little, I loved to watch Michael all the time on &quot;Family Ties&quot;. And as I grew up, I watched his many movies, such as the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films, &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (To me, his best dramatic film by far), &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, &quot;Life with Mikey&quot;, and &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;. And when his new TV series, &quot;Spin City&quot; rolled around, I thought that it was the absolute best Michael J. Fox TV show ever since &quot;Family Ties&quot;! I was at a bookstore one day, and a display showed that Michael was about to release a book entitled &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. I said to myself that I had to get it, no matter what. When I bought it, I sat down and started reading. Man, this is a book that you can't put down for a second! &quot;Lucky Man&quot; gives an inspiring look at Michael J. Fox's life in a nutshell. It gives us sort of a flashback into his life in Canada, his family, his struggles with success, a brief look at his wife, Tracy Pollan, and his films and TV shows. And it all leads up to when he announced to the world that he had Parkinson's disease, which eventually led to the final &quot;Spin City&quot; show with Michael in it, which I will never, ever forget. I instantly felt his pain when I knew what it was like to live with this disease, but Michael has also found &quot;peace, security, and spiritual strength to stand in one place&quot; through his battle for a cure with Parkinson's, and that he is not the only person in the world with Parkinson's. A many number of others have it, such as former Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. And I will be praying that they will find a cure for Michael and many others one day. In conclusion, I just have to say that I very highly recommend this book to anyone who is an avid Michael J. Fox fan, etc. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; somehow reminds you that Michael J. Fox is a really nice guy with an edge, and that it is a great pleasure to watch him on the big screen, and that you do not have to be embarrassed to like him...I know I'm not! &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is the absolute best celebrity autobiography that I have read since...ever! This is an excellent read. It examines the devastating disease of Parkinson's and looks at it from not only a life changing perspective but a self growth view. It is a genuine, engaging and touching look at an incurable disease and how it can make your life better. I usually avoid celebrity bios. I believe actors, like writers, can be judged by their craft. Professionally, what we do should be more important than who we are.However, I've always had a soft spot for Michael J. Fox in Family Tie, Doc Hollywoods and the first Back to the Future. He played earnest young men on the brink of adulthood -- playful and yet open about their own struggles to make sense of their world and their own valuesLike the young men he played, Fox seems earnest and open as he describes the way celebrities live, enclosed in a bubble. He knows he gets special treatment from police officers (&quot;Slow down, Mike! We love watching Family Ties!) and he knows ordinary mortals won't get same-day appointments at world-class neurological centers.He reminds us that celebrities are distanced from the minutiae of everyday life, Agents, managers and producers intervene even when he buys or sells a house. Yet few mortals have to hire armed guards to gain privacy for their own wedding.And Michael's work schedule calls for superhuman powers. Back to the Future was made on less than three hours of sleep.Michael never forgets the bubble is there. He stays close to his Canadian family of origin,. He remains a dedicated husband and father, acknowledging the sacrifices his wife makes to raise the children. He openly admits his battle with alcohol. And Parkinsons tears the bubble wide open. Michael realizes he can use his fame to help others, equally stricken, who lack access to money, microphones and medical care.In a telling episode, Michael's therapist refuses to send a bill to the accounting service. She wants Michael to write a check and hand it to her, personally. And Michael understands. In this office, he must be a person, not a celebrity. The bubble disappears.Lucky Man makes it hard not to like Michael J. Fox. Readers will learn a lot about Parkinsons as well as the Hollywood scene. Mostly we learn how an ordinary person becomes an improbable superstar -- and the hero himself does not miss the irony. I did like this book but It was sad at times because Michael J Fox is such an inspirational man. I do reccomend it and if you do know anyone with parkinsons that isnt sure if they want to read it they should. Seeing I was a girl who grew up in the 1980's during the Back to the Future and Family Ties craze, I have always loved MJF. The fact that he was from Western Canada only made him that much better. I had MJF posters on my walls from all the teen magazines always hoping I would meet some one as cool as Marty McFly and live happily ever after.Reading Lucky Man showed me the other side of Mr. Fox. It exposed to me to all the ups and downs he went through when he was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's disease. It took extreme courage to write this memoir and made publicly known how hard it is to sometimes accept what happens in life. MJF has helped bring awareness to Parkinson's disease it is just too bad that it took some famous to turn people's attention to this disease. this was a great read, i couldn't put it down. i just had to finish it. this was such a powerful book. mjf was very honest with us in telling his story. thanks for the book micheal.paul perry This was good. Not as good as his first, I think. But not bad; not too bad. Twenty words to describe my experience? The best thing about my read was the Kindle, not really not Michael J. Kindle's great; Fox is okay. I remember Michael J. Fox from his sit com days and Back to the Future films. I knew he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. I was fascinated to learn so much more about him. Although he is a celebrity, he comes across as a very humble man. So refreshing and open... and hopefully honest! I've always like MJ Fox and I've read about his disease and how strong he has been in fighting it. This book give others hope and also gives info regarding this disease. It is not because he is an actor, but because in this book he is another human being reaching out to others to give hope. I have been fond of Michael J.Fox and his work for almost 20 years now. It seems as if he's been with me all this time, since I first saw him on the big screen in \"Back to the Future\" and \"Family Ties\". He is not only a very talented actor, with sharp, yet down-to-earth sense of humor, but also a profoundly developed human being. I've always seen him as a personality rather than celebrity, and this book proved that I was right from the beginning. If I could see him in person I would like to thank him for sharing his thoughts and the most amusing facts with me, and congratulate on his ability to cope with the less fortunate moments of his life. This book is a must to read. I recommend it with all my heart. I have been a fan, and will continue to be, of Michael's for about a little over 10 years now. (I am now 20y/o.) I was too young to know about Family Ties being born in the early '80s, but try to watch episodes when/if they air on TV. I think the first movie I saw of his was The Hard Way, and the others just followed. My faves being The Frighteners, Concierge and of course the BTTF series. For some reason, I felt a something when watching him perform. Though he seems completely at ease while acting, being a developing psychic, I picked up on something amiss, not quite right. When the announcement was made in late... what was it... 1998? 97? I was stunned. Shocked might be a better word. I still am. He shows such strengh and clarity that it's so hard to accept. I am never one to read a/bios, but I was compelled to go out and buy the book when it was released in Aus. I couldn't put it down. All the while while reading it I was thinking that this man is not letting this get him down. The title Lucky Man says it all. He's taken it in stride now. The inspiring message for me, from the book, was never to let anything get you down. He's not the victim in this, but the victor. And I love him for it. If there was a Nobel Prize for Courage, acceptance, strengh and inspiration, he'd win hands down. No question. A recommendation for all. Well written and interesting. Michael Fox has an amazing attitude as he faces this debilitating disease. I hope his celebrity can impact research for Parkinson's Disease. A wonderful memoir by a truly great actor who suffers from this terrible disease. How wonderful that he realizes how very lucky he is in so many other ways. Thank you, Michael, for such a beautiful book. I highly recommend this one! This was a riveting glimpse of the interesting well known star. Parkinson's is a very common disease of the elderly, not the younger set. Michael has become a very important spokesperson for the cause. He is indeed a very lucky man. Michael J Fox comes across as a spoiled little boy. Fortunately he has the resources to have surgeries and keep acting.",

         "If you're looking for a classic that's a great read, then this is your book.This book is about a man named Lockwood who comes to Wuthering Heights for a job as a servant. When he meets a man named Heathcliff and becomes interested in his heritage. He learns from a woman named Nelly Dean that Heathcliff is a very interesting person. Heathcliff, a dark mysterious person, was in love with Catherine and it turned into a love and romantic story. But Heathcliff get torn away from Cathy by her brother and a family living four miles living down the road named the Lintons. Heathcliff has a son named Linton. Catherine has a daughter named Catherine and Hindley (Catherine's brother) has a son named Hareton. Now a new love story comes out consisting those three children.You will not be sorry you read this book. It's a tragic reality love story and it's a classic. What do you have to lose? That, along with many other lines, is why so many of us love Wuthering Heights. It is my all-time favorite book. I've loved it since I was about 14 years old (I'm 30 now). I love the atmospheric quality, the isolation, the rawness of human nature that this book portrays. Yes, Heathcliff and Catherine's love now seems a bit crazy, but for people who led such isolated lives, it's not hard to believe. To me, the novel IS Heathcliff. SPOILER ALERT--Once Catherine dies (midway in the novel), you would think the novel would end. But it doesn't, because Heathcliff's story continues. He's still my favorite anti-hero of any novel (sorry but Darcy or Rochester CANNOT compare). A little bit hard to read. Doesn't flow as well as some other books I have read, but still a good read never the less. While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones. A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \" Nadsat,\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of human depth and dynamics. Some readers may be put off by the &quot;classic&quot; genre of this book. The only reason I read it was because I had to for English. Well, I was glad I did. It is extremely difficult to understand at times, especially with the constant switching of narrators. I had previously seen a movie production with Lawrence Olivier, which I loved, and although it was quite different from the novel, it helped me to understand much of what was happening. The romance between Cathy and Heathcliff is absolutely heartrending. To all of those who love passionate romance (though not passionate by today's sense), I recommend this wonderful book. this book has haunted me from the day i've read it. however i'd read it again because it is written so well. Heathcliff and cathy show a love so intense and deep that hatred creeps into those very soulls who once loved more. a story which unfolds gradually, emily bronte has shown immense skill and talent and in the end produced a masterpiece which will never be forgotten.be patient though, it gets too dark and slow at times. but do read it ........its definitely worth it. This was required reading for my Senior English Literature (I was 17) and it was one of the many books that I enjoyed that year. It probably helped that I had read &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i> when I was 12 or so and again in the same English Lit class in high school. It helped me get used to the style and time period. However, as much as I enjoyed &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i>, I liked Emily's writing and story telling much better.It is tragic story about passion, hatred, romance and a love that reaches beyond the grave. If you haven't already, READ IT! What a hard, sad love story. I have watched a couple versions of the movie. The one that followed the book was the best. It speaks to me of eternal, never-ending love I was assgned this book to read for my 12th grade english class. While reading the first chapter, I thought the book would be boring. But as I contuned to read, I fell in love with the characters (even mean old Heithcliff.) The move was a dissapointemnt because it did not even go on to tell the story of the second generation, which by far was even more exciting then the first generation. I love this book, I encourage all to read it. I am thankful for the kindle dictionary. I have gained some new vocabulary for sure. Once I had discovered the darkness of the book, it was too late to stop reading. It is a compelling story. How do I give a book that has endured so many years less than a 5? I give it a 3! Wuthering Heights may be my all-time favorite novel. Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship resists - or defies? - categorization. It's as elemental and everlasting as the moors themselves. Love isn't a sweet confection in this book and is the all the more appealing for that reason. This story is very well written and told. It arrived in great time and shape. I was not born in an English speaking country, so I decided to work on my english.I know that this book is a classic and that the language is not so common this days, but I'm acheiving what I wanted.On the other hand, I'm finding out why this is a real classic. Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion. Not only is this book gorgeous, but the content of the book is very good. I had never read it before, but some one told me to give it a try and I am glad I listened. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Mrs. Taylor's Senior Honors Literature class was assigned to read Jane Eyre. I truly enjoyed reading this book. The details were so good that I could imagine myself there in the action. Jane Eyre is a dynamic character. She is very strong willed. I would recommend this book to just about anyone. To those who wish a first contact with the British literature, I invariably recommend reading the novel Wuthering Heights. After readind such book, one grieves the excessively early death of Emily Bront, and, yet, wonders seriously whether she would have been capable of producing another masterpiece to equal her first, had her fate been different.The characters of this incredibly intense story acquire so vivid a uniqueness as the narrative goes on that the reader, sometimes, even becomes unable to distinguish the characters from the \"real people\" around him, for he is inevitably beguiled into feeling for them all kinds of sentiment; from love to contempt, from pity to hatred; in a wild kaleidoscope of feelings which no sensitive reader will ever forget.But probably, the greatest triumph of this story is the character Heathcliff. Emily Bront creates a being singular in all its ways, especially its revengeful impulses. She renders Heathcliff something more than human, a true entity!, as she describes his life in that ingeniously exerted gossip fashion. By revealing to us only as much information as the closest person to his whole story (Nelly Dean) has, the writer presents him more as a legend of a superstitious countryside place than an ordinary person.Besides the gossip fashion used throughout the book, there is another element that helps make Heathcliff rather inhuman: his emotions; the consuming love he feels (which becomes more than idolatry for a godess after Catherine's death; she becomes the whole purpose of his \"unlife\"), the savageness of his worst outbursts of anger, the malignity he had to infuse to his personality in order to endure the harsh live that succeeded his misterious being born, and other traits which the heedful peruser shall most certainly divine from the many passages of the book.I just entreat that the new readers beware calling Heathcliff essencially evil; you try to analise the life he was forced to bear since his beggning, even before his being rescued from the streets of Liverpool by Old Earnshaw, ere trying to draw any unfair conclusions about this quite unfortunate being.Not only Heathcliff, but all the other characters call our attention in this heartfelt romance: It is quite impossible for Catherine Earnshaw's fierce wildness to pass unnoticed to us; she is the true representation of the unbridled spirit of those moors in her fits of passion, and her actions can reverberate as a thunderstrike on the people who love her, thus casting on them shadows of despair and sadness as swarthy as the ones that dwell in her soul at the moment. It is also interesting to perceive that the fact of her being a woman, a simple wife, and therefore having no great pihsical or social power of which to avail herself, does not render her harmless to the hearts of those who dote on her, for she has, and knows how to use, the power to hurt them in the most grievous way anyone could ever hurt; by degrading the greatest idol and reason of their lives, which is herself. Curious indeed is to notice that both the whole of her hate and the whole of her love are always bestowed upon the same people; another trait that leads back to her main one: her heart brimful with wildness.Actually, one could make thorough analyses concerning each of the rich and allegorical characters of this book; the puritan curmudgeon Joseph, the sweet younger Catherine, the noble - hearted rustic Hareton Earnshaw, the standard good - natured housemaid Nelly Dean, and so on; this is only a space for a brief review and recommendation however, and thus I ought not to indulge with composing an extensive critique on this amazing and unforgettable work of art; even because I would refuse to consider any article I could write in the moment completely worthy of being bestowed upon such a masterwork due to my having less time to spare for the performing of so important a task than I should now.Finally, i wish to praise and call the readers' attention to the skillfully written end of Wuthering Heights; with Heathcliff lying as an unearthly, unnamed interloper beside Edgar and Catherine; as what he had always been throughout his hapless life. Although it took me 2 tries reading this to understand who the heck was the narrator, once I figured it out, I loved it!Listening to the stories being told with Heathcliff and Cathy..it's sad yet amazing. An interesting read. Love is a great and terrible killer in the end. And there are many lessons to be learned from the story. I've read a lot of the reviews below and many have said that this is a love story. If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me. I read this book in high school as required reading. Even though I had to struggle through some of the archaic language I remember loving it. Seeing it as a free download intrigued me to read it once again and loved it even more. For the quality of the binding - it's fair at best- the pages at the end sit jagged and uneven. But this was quite inexpensive, and it didn't bother me terribly.The book itself was good. Personally I think Jane Eyre was better, but Wuthering Heights has unusual, headstrong, and not always pleasant characters even in the role of the lovers in the story which makes it very unique. The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story. I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc. I used to love Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice was my favorite book; I've read it so many times that I can quote Elizabeth Bennet in my sleep. I know every single word of the movie Emma by heart. So, naturally, I felt compelled to read it. I love the flowery language, how Emma and Mr. Knightly converse so eloquently. However, still being a student, I am subjected to the whims of my teachers. When Mr. Sneeringer told us to have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights read in a week, I groaned. How it pained me to set aside my precious Emma! I was especially greived because I recognized the author's name. About a year and a half ago, another honors English teacher commanded us to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. That book is definetly not reader-friendly. The vernacular of the Victorian era that completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel worked completely against Charlotte Bronte. It made reading a difficult novel all the more tedious. I feared that I was in for another dose of the awful stuff when I received Wuthering Heights. I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised, but that doesn't even come close to my feelings. The mystery was too much for me; I couldn't put it down. Wherever I went, Wuthering Heights came with me. I took it to class, to my meals and to bed. I literally fell asleep reading the two nights my book lasted. I found it to be extremely powerful and compelling. I aspire to become a great writer someday, so I have studied many things necessary to a great novel, including plot and character development. Emily Bronte is a master at these. Her characters are so complex, and, yet, I can still identify with them. They are so well developed that it makes an intriguing story impossibly compelling. She is truly a master of the Gothic novel. I am still in awe of the graphic description of all the dark forces surrounding the Heights. I became part of the whole story when I read this book. Yes, I still love Jane Austen, but now I readily admit that there is definetly room for Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights on my bookshelf. The delivery of WH was efficient as it went directly to my kindle. The book grabbed my attention immediately and was an easy read. My Review:Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights is a classic that all should read. It uniquely portrays the undoubtedly present fight between earnest and passionate love and vigorous hate. This novel is the epidemy of a tale that twists the reader's previous opinion on innocent love.Wuthering Heights is the home to the Earnshaw family. It lies desolate from the world upon the moors and wetlands of vast fields. This home is quiet large in size, however it is musty and gray in color and rather lonely in its outward appearance. The master is the father, Mr. Earnshaw, then there is Mrs. Earnshaw and the children, whom are Hindley and Catherine. Further into the novel a child is added into the Earnshaw family, but it is not their own. This child is later known as Heathcliff, an Irish gypsy waif found and pitied by the master during his stay at Liverpool. The master took such pain in seeing the boy on his own that he brought him home to his children to accompany. But Earnshaw's son, Hindley, from the very beginning detested Heathcliff for the reason that the master, much too obviously, favored \"poor Heathcliff\" than that of his own son!AS the years past, turmoil, jealousy and overall hatred consumed Hindley, leaving Heathcliff and him to be forever enemies. On the contrary, Catherine and Heathcliff were the best of friends and they grew to love each other dearly. In fact the were inseparable to the point that the greatest punishment that either could have been given was that of being away from each other.The two were quite rambunctious and always up for adventure. One day Catherine and Heathcliff met other children at the residence of Thrushcross Grange ( the Lintons, the rich and spoiled kids!!!). Catherine instantly fell in love with their classy way of life and left Heathcliff to eat her dust!! haha..Catherine still loved Heathcliff but grew to understand that she was just too high class of a women for him , resulting in her decision to love and marry her material possessor Edgar Linton ( one of the rich kids, his sister was Isabella Linton.)Stricken by grief, Heathcliff pursued till his very death his soul and body...his dear Catherine. Without her he was not complete, and each day he yearned her presence.In volume two of this novel the reader comes to know of whom marries who and who are their children. Heathcliff in this volume becomes an aggressive hateful man and his once joyful heart is turned black and cold; full of hate. Cathy, the descendant of Catherine, is portrayed by Bronte as the fulfillment of her mother's dream that was never reached ( marrying her true love). And whom Cathy marries is her cousin ( I know gross right?...well she marries 2 of her cousins!!! nastier!) who is known as Hareton. They, in a way, are the parallel of their elders, but they are more so in the sense that they are the \"happy ending\" to the love fest of Catherine and Heathcliff.Overall, I would have to say that this book is not only credited for its educational material, rather to me it is credited by its insightfully constructed plot. Bronte is an amazingly talented author who places her own viewpoints and morals skillfully throughout this classic. This novel is great because of its symmetrical structure of love and hate, nature and culture, and lastly the ongoing fight between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. At the story's finale it is truly left up to the reader to decide whom they believe won the battle. At first one believes it is Wuthering Heights due to Catherine giving in to marrying her love, yet it could be the Grange for both Catherine and Hareton beating Heathcliff's evilness in the end. What readers should come to appreciate from this novel is that Bronte really applied her inner emotions to this novel and the whole story is told from her beliefs and her viewpoint on the matter of Catherine and Heathcliff's immortal love which is too sacred to control, therefore Bronte ends this love triangle by their death for the reason that in some cases love cannot be joined for it is so strong that peace could not be kept with its overpowering presence on human kind.--ChiChi---- This is supposed to be \"one of the most famous love stories in the English language\" (this is what the back flip of the Oxford University Press edition says), but where is the love? The characters are all selfish and self-obsessed, especially that monster Heathcliff, who even tortured his own son to death for he is hellbent on his imaginary revenge. The other characters are not much better, they are all psychologically immature and unstable, relishing on mentally and sometimes physically abusing others. As a book it also has little about the social institutions of the period, the story takes place within two households, which eventually merged into one with a couple of (I would say incestuous) marriages. The characters are also not very believable (for example, how do they earn their living? How did Heathcliff make his fortune in a short three years? The author does not say). They die far too easily from grief and anger. They have just one thing in mind: to hate and torture others around them. They have little interactions with other people except within their shrinking inbred gene pool. They seem more like the manufacture of a mentally ill social recluse, which I think more or less fits the description of the author herself. It is altogether a very dark and sordid story.I think Emily Bronte could actually write, but what a waste of her gift! And it must be a fine something indeed, for it kept me, a fairly discerning reader, going all the way through despite the dated language, occasional impenetrable dialect, and characters who as grown adults behaved precisely the way I remember behaving when I was about 16.Part of the 'something', I think, is the surprisingly modern psychological insight underlying the book. Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love' while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and families because of some perceived wrong. But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars. i was made to read this in high school and hated every word of it...how could i like a book where i despised every character, right?? then i read it again in my mid 20's and i still despised every character...but absolutely loved it! it's now one of my fave novels and i've read it many times over. i think the style and subject matter is a little beyond the reach of most teens and it's a shame it's offered to them as it has probably put many off trying many of the classics later in life. At first, I griped and complained about having to read this book. My aunt practically shoved it into my hands and told me that I was to read this book and like it! Well, I read it, and I don't like it at all...I absolutely LOVE it! I'm really into romance and this one hits home.Emily Bronte died one year before its publication in 1847 and is perhaps one of the most powerfully written books in the English language. I was first 13 when I read this book and it took me three more times for me to understand what the heck Joseph was saying! .... learned in this type of speech, it's really an understanding book.Just the undying love between Heathcliff and Catherine alone is enough to put anyone in tears. And how Heathcliff is so masculine, yet so insecure and rude. How did Emily Bronte come up with this passion and this knowlegde, when she seldom left her house? You can't help but fall into sync with one or more of the characters. Tragically, yet beautifully written.This book is truly a classic, you'll never want to put it down! Get it!!! Wuthering Heights is a disturbingly dark book about love, obsession and revenge. It is a romantic novel full of twists and turns that nearly requires the reader to keep a running dictionary of characters, especially since names have a tendency to pop up in different places and on different people throughout the novel. I read this novel for a class assignment in Victorian Literature but it is helpful to know that the book employs many themes of the Romantic literary genre as well. Victorian ideas of social class are brought up as well as the fantasies of adolescence. Some of the Romantic ideas found in the novels include the idea of the tragic landscape. The landscape of the novel is foreboding and isolated, borrowed most likely from the gothic novel. The characters are extreme in their varying passions and the concept of the dream is used in a type of ghostly communication. One of the story's narrators has a dream of being visited by the ghost of Catherine, which causes a startling and dramatic reaction in Heathcliff. The belief that the reader cannot fully hate Heathcliff because of how he was mistreated as a child is also a Romantic ideal.The story contains a great deal of darkness and some cruelty, which may turn readers away. Love is often extreme to the point of violence in the novel while the romances themselves are nearly incestuous in tone. Cousins marry and adopted siblings hold lifelong affections and obsessions for each other. The novel also illustrates an element of cruelty that can be slightly disturbing at times. Heathcliff, the novel's antagonist, goes as far as to string up the beloved dog of the young woman he courts after Catherine rejects him.The main focus of the story is the rather twisted love story element that develops between Catherine and Heathcliff. Heathcliff is adopted into Catherine's family at a young age and the pair become close, though Catherine rejects him because he is poor and instead marries a rich neighbor. Though throughout the novel, other romances develop between the two highly inbred families, they are side stories in comparison to the main romance.The love of Catherine and Heathcliff eventually develops into an obsession that lasts, and in fact becomes even stronger with the eventual death of Catherine. Her spirit seems to haunt Heathcliff and further fire his obsession. Even before Catherine's death this obsessive love broadens to include an equally obsessive drive to ruin the lives of all the people who mistreated him and stood between him and Catherine, including her husband and older brother.These obsessions eventually lead to the last of the major themes of the novel, revenge. A good part of the book is spent upon Heathcliff's attempts to destroy the lives of anyone and everyone who mistreated him or got in the way of his relationship with Catherine. His need for revenge does not lessen as the book moves on and Heathcliff continues to take his revenge even upon the next generation, including Catherine's daughter and his own son. Whether or not Heathcliff succeeds in his attempts I leave to the reader.Personally, I enjoyed this book a great deal, if for no other reason than the simple fact that it was quite different from the usual school assigned reading. I was pleasantly surprised by how well woven and engaging the book was. The calculating lengths that Heathcliff goes to in order fulfill his quest for revenge are nearly reason enough to read the book. The old style language of the book, which I expected to be a hindrance, was hardly noticeable. In short, if you can handle (or enjoy) the book's darker aspects, then I highly recommend this classic to you. (And I'm not just saying that because I have to! ;))Enjoy! There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended. I've read this book about million times and each time it gets better and better. I wish i had written this book, it touches every part of you when you read it. I am still trying to read this book. It is difficult to get into, but I haven't given up yet. Can anyone ever get sick of reading Wuthering Heights? A beautiful, thrilling classic that everyone should read.... perhaps more than once! i have to confess this was the first book to whet forever my craving for darkness. it seems so light and brainy after years; but then i can go back and read again and again, now it only takes an hour or two, and each read it pulls me back into that original mood like giant vultures' wings slowly flapping over me. heathcliff is of course the most truthful embodiment of a woman's fantasy. emily dug far down, long before evolution was the buzz word, when all we knew was that adam and eve fell, and emily knew the coldness of life's force. my professors, one of these i'm thinking of male, the other female, dismissed my theory as misreading of a revolutionily defiant woman. how can they be so far from their own guts? the worse was the male professor, a diehard wimp-roaster who was jealous of heathcliff's hardness and fevered coldness. even my deep love kate bush missed the mood with her whininess of \"heathcliff it's me Cathy i'm coming home now\"--so much sentimentality! emily goes further into any heart of darkness that light and cheery old joseph ever could dare. even though this masterpiece has seemed airier and brighter now i've dipped further, in other works, it is so strong it can still trick me back into its spell. Wuthering Heights met my expectations as well as exceeded them. I will admit i was tempted to give the novel four stars because of the difficulty in grasping the intricate intertwining of the characters. BUT I came to realize that the genius in the novel lies within the geniusly thought out symmetrical family plots. Many describe the novel as being very dark, but i , on the other hand, describe Wuthering Heights as being raw and original. Emily Bronte can only be marveled apon. How could someone with a secluded life, much as her characters lived, have such a great insight into these wild, but true characters? Its almost unbelievable, but I now give her respect, just as much as I have for her other remarkable sister Charlotte. Although Jane Eyre is still my favorite novel, Wuthering Heights is not far behind that coveted spot. READ WUTHERING HEIGHTS!!!!!!!! Emily Bronte wrote a novel that is both rough and sweet at the same time. This novel is fantastic in its voice. Mostly it is told through the eyes of Nelly Dean, housekeeper/protector of Catherine/busybody who is bold, blunt and strong. The novel is very much linear making it an easy read. Helpfully, in the front of this edition there is a family tree which will aide the reader immensely, because not only are there a lot of characters, there are many with the same name (though different ages). The novel itself is beautiful in its portrayal of everything; from the moors to even Heathcliff (though spiteful and mean as he is), Bronte created a world that truly exists for the reader. Be warned: this is not a world of balls and romantic marriage proposals as Austen, but rather base life as was most likely lived, isolated on the moors.What really I loved about this book was perhaps what came before and after the actual contents. Bronte and her two sisters originally came out with their books within a year of each other under the guise of being three male brothers Ellis, Acton and Currer Bell. In this particular edition, there is a \"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\" written by Charlotte Bronte after her sister's passing and on the commencement of new printings of their novels. This edition also includes and Editor's Preface by Charlotte. Commentary from E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and a review by George Henry Lewes printed in 1850 come at the end and are very interesting, just to see how two famous authors and one critic looked at the book. These \"bonus pages\" made Emily (Ellis) come to life for me.Read this book. Would you like to become acquainted with one of the greatest love stories of all time? Did you know there is an occidental answer to Dream of the Red Chamber, with that same kind of passion so intense it borders on hatred and madness? Would you like to hear a live performance of a really FUNNY novel, with slyly ironic or blackly comical vignettes every few pages? Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more. (For instance, one of its most remarkable features, instantly lost in any so-called \"film version,\" is its wonderfully intricate narrative structure, quite on a par with that of a Joseph Conrad novel such as Lord Jim or Victory.)Now, who on earth could read WH properly so that all those nuances and overtones might be brought together in a single performance? Michael Page and Laural Merlington, that's who! These two are perfectly attuned to all the qualities that make WH a masterpiece.(And no, there is no technical flaw to worry about. That reviewer was confused by the exotic settings required for playing back the audio cassette version, I suspect, although ostensibly she was reviewing the CD version, and that made the negative remark doubly weird, a true non sequitur. I've owned the audio cassette version for several years, and I just recently bought the CD version too. Either way, the recording is a treasure. If you love literature, buy it! If you're not sure what literature is all about, buy it! Then you'll see.) Wuthering Heights is a different type of story. It follows the developments of two generations of families and the family dynamics within from the point of an outsider being told the story. It almost reads like a family history if not for the love story thrown in. For the time period, the portrayal of certain scenes was quite graphic, and it's interesting to try to gain that perspective from our current time period, where violence and sex are pretty much societal norms.A great book! I would suggest making a family tree as you read; it does get a bit confusing! For the first time I got to read this absolutely astounding masterpiece, I got thrilled and enchanted by the most beautiful language, descriptions that make you see the set and actions before your eyes, and of course this consuming crazy passion which entwines both main characters. Emily Bronte succeed not only in creating a most touching, and yet horrifying love story, which can only be compared to Phantom by Susan Kay,but also managed to make it a Gothic tale with symbolism and double meaning all around. This is a book to be read many times, and understood deeply. I was 16 when I've read it for the first time, and since then I reread it for countless number of times, and each time I discovered something new. It helped me to grow emotionally. In this story, &quot;physical&quot; true love is lifted above our world, ad turned into something more spiritual. The bond between heathcliff and Cathy was so strong that it conquered death. A greatest love story of all time. A must-read for anyone. I read this book because I like the Kate Bush song and wanted to learn the story. It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.[END OF SPOILERS]It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read. i wrote my full review on my test mr matta im just lazy because i dont want to type it allWuthering heights is a good book. If one does not pay full attention and not try to multi task while reading u will get lost, and end up hating classical literature and then not getting a good education then working as a a bus boy for those who did get a godd education (dramatization)Wuthering Heights is the height of classical literature and shows the best of victorian literature (yet another dramatization). I still think the book is a must read because it is very entertaining and it makes u look smart when u talk to stupid people about it: )in closing words i have to quote the most psychologically insane, obsurdely stupid person in mr matta's class \"Cleafy!\" Wuthering Heights is one of oldest romance novels and stands as a classic in litterature history.All through the book you will meet great contrasts that to a certain extent can explain the actions. Wuthering heights is the land of storm and wilderness compared to the quiet and more passive Thruscross Grange where one might think it's more appropriate for children to grow up. The Earnshaw family lives on Wuthering Heights while the Linton family is from Thruscross Grange. When those two contrasts meets with the children of these two families, the conflicts starts. Catherine and Heathcliff are drawn to eachother from the begining and their passion is powerful and destructive. There's love, hate and suffering, but written in a poetic somewhat advanced language and it's echanting how you get caught up with this book.Sad is it that Emily Bront died the year after its publication at the age of thirty... But with this novel and her poems, she is one of the most well known female English writers of the 18th century.You will surely miss out on something great by not reading this book. I warmly recommend Wuthering Heights to everyone who loves to read. It is truly a unique piece of writing! Having had this book as an assignment in college.... I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it. I really tripped my way through it as a freshman. But now over ten years later I am liking this one more and more!The story centers around poor Heathcliff and his sister/ loved one, Catherine. Heathcliff has lived a life of struggle and woe. He has been disadvantaged and mistreated. Even when he is saved by Catherine's father and brought to live with them he is still, disadvantaged. He is tortured by Hindley, Catherine's brother and made to live a life of pain and anguish.When Catherine leaves home and marries Edgar Linton. Heathcliff become even more tortured as the person he loves is taken from him.This story is one filled with regret, longing and revenge. We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature... and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred. The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on. The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.Excellent Book! As with other Wuthering Heights editions, I will not delve into the depths of this strangest and strongest of novels, with its haunting poetical intensity, its everyday realism, its display of physical and psychical violence, its metaphysical contents and its eerie beautiful otherness. As the noted critic C. A. Swinburne put it in 1883:\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\".By the way, whatever the edition you end up with (or none), don't forget to havea try with Emily Bront&eacute; poems, or a sensible selection from them. I realize that this review is by far too long: so, if you are in a hurry, I think that you can skip safely to the last paragraph (\"SO WHAT?\") for practical recommendations.The real issue that we face now is: how much does THIS PARTICULAR EDITION of Emily Bront's novel measure up to its intended goal? How does it compare with other editions currently available?Beginning with the bottom line, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST \"STUDY\" EDITIONS EVER, together with Beth Newman's one for Broadview Press and Dunn's one for Norton Critical (4th edition). By a \"study\" edition (in roughly the same sense as a \"study\" Bible), I mean one that is richly annotated, with an interesting Introduction and a variety of context-oriented documents, such as critical reviews or essays, biographical or chronological items, a selection of poems or other writings... Such an edition must be evaluated firstly by his handling (more or less scholarly or careful) of the TEXT(s) involved, then by the choice of supplementary materials (whether interesting or not, balanced or else), in third place by the quality and accuracy of the Introduction and notes, ending with very important issues of design (user-friendly, beautiful) and material production (durability, paper and print quality, binding).IN SUMMARY, lest I get too long and formal, this is a well cared for, accurate and reliable 1847-type text, springing out of the University of Virginia electronic texts, but tightly controlled by the 1976 Clarendon Edition one (by Hilda Marsden and Ian Jack), and silently adapted as punctuation is concerned (resulting in a friendly version, which the scholarly reconstructed punctuation of Clarendon is not).THE INTRODUCTION is short (11 pp) and well planned so that it opens ways for understanding, but can be read before the novel without spoiling anything.It sounds a bit like run-of-the-mill material, but this is a deceiving image(Alison Booth's command of the material is always there).THE ANNOTATION IS VERY GOOD and extensive enough, with full and right glosses of the dialect tirades, and accurate, to-the-point information on biblical or literary references, or contextual ways and means.In that most elusive of references, the one about Milo (of Croton) in Chapter IX, however, Alison Booth edition slips a little, like many other good ones (with Clarendon doing a little better, the ones getting the story right if not in full are Barnes&Noble;, Wordsworth Classics, Penguin/Nestor, Broadview/Newman, Oneworld Classics and the excellent but ill-fated Routledge edition by Heather Glen). According to the Geography of Strabo, Book XII, which is the only source for this story, Milo in his old age tried to tear apart in two a tree half split and with a wedge to retain it open. He then exerted all his force with his hands, opening the gap wide enough for the wedge to drop off; the tree closed (it requires an ever increasing force to continue opening the trunk -this is Hooke's Law in physics-) and trapped the hands of Milo, who was then devoured by wolves.It is regarding this story that we read in the novel:\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\" (who also tried unwisely and deadly to SEPARATE something). Saying in a note, as Booth does, \"In the classical fable, Milo, an athlete, tried to pull a tree up by the roots\" is a little misleading (not only do we lose the \"separation factor\", but also accuracy. Milo is neither a fable nor a myth, but a real human being with a place both in time and on earth, mentioned with consistent witness by two of the best historians of the time, other than Strabo. As to the stories connected to him, nothing is known for sure when we go into the details, and so the label \"legend\" is most appropriate).The CONTEXTUAL MATERIALS are well chosen and presented. The only problem, and I think THE GREATEST PROBLEM with this otherwise excellent edition, is that there are 40+ items of this material and only 130 pages to fit them in: it looks hopelessly like a motley medley of maddening fragments, with, say, ONLY FIVE OF EMILY'S POEMS, which is both a pity and a blunder. There are interesting curios as the \"Table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics... according to their rank in a household\".More important are the pages devoted to Yorkshire dialect (too scarce) and ballads (very good). There is also a fair amount of space (11 pages) allotted to \"cultural dissemination\", that is, works of art (songs, theatrical or musical adaptations as well as TV or movie ones, sequels...) deriving from or related with the novel.The data included are very good and complete except for the chapter on translations in which, just as an example, only two translations into Spanish are listed, and only one in current use although it is barely acceptable: there are by now no less than TEN Spanish translations easily available; some are very good, some are rightly annotated, none is both things together and none is based on the 1847 text (but on the 1850 one).MATERIAL PRODUCTION is... fair enough, as far as I can tell without ripping apart my copy. A not-too-bad paperback, perhaps even signature-sewn but without flaps (with cover corners and even front-edge vulnerable). Paper quality looks good (time will tell) and printing quality is excellent. Design is clear and user-friendly(I will not comment on the typeface they use for big headlines, perhaps somebody will love it).SO WHAT?If an accurate and reliable text and a rich annotation are a must,then stick to this Longman Cultural Edition (by Alison Booth).If you can make do with a generally reliable text with a few errors, some idiosyncratic readings and inconsistencies and, besides, you don't mind a scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you will appreciate the finest choice ever of contextual materials (but with only EIGHT OF EMILY's POEMS) as well as a MOST INTERESTING and thought-provoking INTRODUCTION (29pp), then choose the Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman (be sure not to pick their earlier one by Christopher Heywood!).If, on the other side, you may accept a generally reliable text and a very scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you would appreciate the best presentation ever of early reviews and similar materials (Charlotte's prefaces for 1850, and some letters by Charlotte) and you would enjoy a really good and wide enough selection of EIGHTEEN EMILY's POEMS, then don't miss the elegant and no-nonsense Fourth Edition of Norton Critical (by R.J. Dunn, with almost the same text, for good and worse, of the late and mourned William M. Sale 1963 1st edition).Have a haunting reading! Sadly, I couldn't even finish it. It is well written and interesting but it is depressing in the extreme. I read about half and I had to stop reading it and start reading a more uplifting story.I was expecting something closer to her sister's Jane Eyre, oh how wrong I was. In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read. This is one of the classics that I have downloaded onto my Kindle from Amazon. I like that it didn't have a cost and loved the story. It is good literature and I would recommend it to others, especially writers who could gain some tips on telling a good story. SummaryWuthering Heights is a dark tale of enduring passion and violent love. Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers. Good awesome book love it very very badly I would recommend this book to you in love! XD cool g Would you like to become acquainted with one of the greatest love stories of all time? Did you know there is an occidental answer to Dream of the Red Chamber, with that same kind of passion so intense it borders on hatred and madness? Would you like to hear a live performance of a really FUNNY novel, with slyly ironic or blackly comical vignettes every few pages? Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more. (For instance, one of its most remarkable features, instantly lost in any so-called \"film version,\" is its wonderfully intricate narrative structure, quite on a par with that of a Joseph Conrad novel such as Lord Jim or Victory.)Now, who on earth could read WH properly so that all those nuances and overtones might be brought together in a single performance? Michael Page and Laural Merlington, that's who! These two are perfectly attuned to all the qualities that make WH a masterpiece.(And no, there is no technical flaw to worry about. That reviewer was confused by the exotic settings required for playing back the audio cassette version, I suspect, although ostensibly she was reviewing the CD version, and that made the negative remark doubly weird, a true non sequitur. I've owned the audio cassette version for several years, and I just recently bought the CD version too. Either way, the recording is a treasure. If you love literature, buy it! If you're not sure what literature is all about, buy it! Then you'll see.) Best book I ever read in my whole life. It's a really good book. I love withering heights. :) &#8482; Heathcliff is an orphan, adopted by the Earnshaws, where he falls madly in love with their daughter, Catherine. But Catherine denies her true love for Heathcliff, instead marrying Edgar Linton for his wealth, education and good looks. In denying herself Heathcliff, Catherine falls to madness and death, and Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins not only her, but everyone Heathcliff has ever associated with.The truth is this is a really well crafted novel. Many are put off by the dark and brooding themes. Also the word choice and frequent switch of narrators can be confusing. But you have to give the book time. Emily Bronte's word use is masterful, giving the characters great scope and the setting an eerie vividness. The revelations are shocking, but also very gripping. It's a love story that goes tragically wrong for the characters, and it leaves a real imprint on you when you finish it. If your into tragic love stories, it is a classic, so you should consider it. And don't worry, the ending isn't THAT tragic. Passion, hate, love, action, horror - a great story by a great writer. It brought tears to my eyes, which doesn't happen to me often. Wuthering Heights is an incredibly hard to read book since it is written in old-English. The story is centered on the Earnshaw family and Heathcliff a vagabond who was taken in by the late Master Earnshaw. Heathcliff was treated as a member of the family. After the death of Master Earnshaw, Heathcliff is treated as a lowly stable boy. He doesn't care because the young and vivacious Catherine is always there to console him. The two are inseparable. When Catherine denounces his love and the shame it would cause her to marry him he flees from the Heights never to be seen again for 3 years.Heathcliff is full of vengeance. He wants retribution for all the pain the Earnshaw family has given him. The only love in his heart is that for Catherine, who remains in his mind and heart till the end. Don't know why I love it but I do. Always wish things had turned out differently for Heathcliff and Cathy (senior on both). Wuthering Heights is the pinnacle of British literature. It is more than a book, it is an entity, an institution. A definite must-read Great book, great love story. If you have seen the classic movie with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon you won't recognize much of it in this. I love the movie, too, but kind of think it as mostly a different story. Wuthering Heights is one of oldest romance novels and stands as a classic in litterature history.All through the book you will meet great contrasts that to a certain extent can explain the actions. Wuthering heights is the land of storm and wilderness compared to the quiet and more passive Thruscross Grange where one might think it's more appropriate for children to grow up. The Earnshaw family lives on Wuthering Heights while the Linton family is from Thruscross Grange. When those two contrasts meets with the children of these two families, the conflicts starts. Catherine and Heathcliff are drawn to eachother from the begining and their passion is powerful and destructive. There's love, hate and suffering, but written in a poetic somewhat advanced language and it's echanting how you get caught up with this book.Sad is it that Emily Bront died the year after its publication at the age of thirty... But with this novel and her poems, she is one of the most well known female English writers of the 18th century.You will surely miss out on something great by not reading this book. I warmly recommend Wuthering Heights to everyone who loves to read. It is truly a unique piece of writing! I last read this in high school, and I have to say, revisiting the classics has been a great addition to my summer reading list this year! Even knowing how it would end, the story is seen in a different light with 30+ years of living experience now under my belt. Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel, is very different from her famous sisters', and critical opinion in the last few decades has decided it is the best of them, which truly says much. It first got mixed reviews but has continually risen to the point where it topped a recent poll of the greatest love stories, showing that it is one of the few classics with true mass appeal. Wuthering is indeed a masterpiece with a thrilling story, superb characterization, stunning prose, and more than a little sociopolitical relevance. Its power has enthralled readers for over a century and a half and shows no sign of lessening.The story itself is one of the most immediately engrossing elements. Tightly plotted and deftly executed, it draws us in irresistibly and never lets go; those afraid of classic literature because they think it boring, pretentious, or portentous should know this is a striking exception. It is the kind of tale that does not come off well in summary, as the blank faces staring at me when I gave a college presentation on it prove. Though short for a Victorian novel at about three hundred pages, the complex multi-generational plot is told via flashbacks, nested narration, etc. Suffice is to say that the action is intensely dramatic and highly emotional; it is drenched in pathos and runs us through a gamut of other emotions. It reaches a fever pitch quite soon and hardy lets up - a story of true immediacy and intensity. With its time jumping and non-linearity, the complicated delivery creates significant suspense, and we become supremely interested.The key to the book's success, though, is surely its characters. Many are vividly and memorably drawn with stunning realism and often with great sympathy; we truly feel with and for them. Catherine, the initial female lead, is one of Victorian literature's more striking heroines; an essentially unconventional woman stuck in a time and place where convention reigned unchecked, she has great passions that find no vent. She loves Heathcliff but cannot bring herself to defy society enough to marry him. Her character thus subtly critiques Victorian society, showing how oppressive mores were detrimental to many, especially women, crushing their spirit and denying them happiness.Heathcliff himself is of course the most famous character and the one most attractive to many. As a heterosexual man, I have never been able to see his appeal; he seems overwhelmingly selfish and cruel with almost no redeeming qualities. However, I have seen women discuss him as if he were not only real but the Sexiest Man Alive - even ones who have never read Wuthering! He seems to be among many women's favorite characters ever and, I suspect, is a large part of the reason the book topped the poll. What makes him so attractive is a very interesting question; I assume it is a combination of his profound passion - along with its consequent romantic and sexual potential - plus his bad boy status. He is in some ways the prototypical bad boy, living by his own code and not caring what others think - bravely and boldly original. One may well wonder how or why women excuse his sadistic qualities, but he certainly stands well above the drab gentlemen populating most Victorian fiction. They are stuck in a time warp, but he is distinctly alive, as much a part of our day - nay, any day - as his own. Even putting subjective attraction aside, though, he is undeniably fascinating, if far from traditionally likable. This is in one sense because, like Shakespeare's Richard III, he is upfront about his villainy - nay, positively revels in it. He does not try to hide his nature, and there is something perversely admirable in how he carefully meditates and follows his plans. More fundamentally, he is more sinned against than sinning; his detestable qualities surely stem in great part from his brutal upbringing. This not only makes him a sort of sympathetic figure - and certainly one of pathos - but also raises very currently relevant questions about parents and guardians' responsibility for their children's actions later in life. The topic received almost no mainstream, much less legal, attention until the last few decades, showing just how far ahead of her time Bronte was here as in many other ways.Of course no one can discuss the book without mentioning the love story, which in its way is one of the most monumentally engrossing. However, that it was ranked first truly surprises because it has nothing like a happy ending and is indeed a thwarted love tale; Catherine and Heathcliff do not even get as much time together as Romeo and Juliet. The depth of their passion despite this is surely a large part of the attraction, but it may very well be that the lack of consummation - not just in the physical sense - is precisely what moves so many. Love is perhaps the most universal feeling, but the rarity of its being requited - much less reaching full mutual fruition - is truly tragic. The sad truth is that, whatever happy love stories' escapist value, far more people can relate to unhappy ones. Wuthering's is bitterly familiar to the countless people who have loved only from afar, displaying the wretched phenomenon's broken feelings and often fatal consequences with stirring verisimilitude and extreme emotional vitality. The many who have been in similar situations will feel a great personal connection, but even those who have not will have great sympathy for this unfortunately common dark side of human experience.Some of the novel's social criticism clearly comes into play here, and it is to society's credit that things have changed to the point where very few would disdain a Catherine/Heathcliff union. Yet some of the love's story's other fundamental elements remain just as relevant - are indeed as old as humanity and will surely last as long as we do. It shows the dramatically high pitch that passion and other emotions can reach even - or perhaps particularly - when they have no release. Many works show love's greatness, but Wuthering is remarkable for showing its dark side; the heart has terrible truths hiding just beneath ostensible calm that can storm out at any time - often with dire results. The novel does not flinch from displaying how our most primitive emotions can easily have savage effects; if love brings out the best in humanity, it can at least as easily bring out the worst. Perhaps no classic love story is less sentimental or otherwise traditional; this made it stand out distinctly amid many superficially similar Victorian tales, but it would be unusual in any era. Critics did not like to see the unadorned display of mental and physical cruelty, but less prudish later eras have seen its terrible truth. Bronte seemed to have a profound understanding of elemental feelings and stark knowledge of the beastly facts about men and women in love, which seems near-preternatural considering her sheltered life. It is almost enough to make one believe her muse was truly inspired in the external sense so often described by artists but so hard for others to even conceive. No one can read this without a sense of the incalculable loss to literature when such a genius was cut off so early; that she did not live to write more novels is truly regrettable. However she did it, she clearly drew inspiration from a well at human nature's very heart, which is why the book continues to strike such deep chords so powerfully.The younger generation's love story is of course far more traditionally placid. It is nearly as compelling in its way and introduces important poetic justice and irony issues but takes a definite backseat. Those not as responsive to - or who repress - stormy passions may find it more relatable, but it serves primarily as a useful contrast for most readers. If nothing else, it proves Wuthering is more nuanced and subtle than one might think given its melodramatic reputation.All this implies a strong realist perspective, which the book certainly has, but it also belongs to the gothic school so common in the nineteenth century with all its associated supernatural overtones. Requisite ghost aside, we get among other such elements an immense storm that is not only a pathetic fallacy but seems to have some kind of paranormal, perhaps divinely-controlled, significance. The vivid North England moor setting contributes substantially to all this; the novel imbues the strongly, if unconventionally, picturesque setting with a near-magical air, describing it with great believability and stunning originality. Wuthering is one of the main reasons that the area has long had great, near-occult sway in the popular imagination. As all this suggests, the book also has more than a dash of Romanticism. Like most great works, it is hard to classify, the mix of genres and styles forming a magic all its own.A final noteworthy aspect is the deceptively simple prose. Despite the relative conciseness and lack of the florid description that turns so many off to Victorian fiction, Bronte manages to describe her setting at least as clearly and memorably as authors with far thicker works. The landscapes and manors are drawn with stark beauty; no one who reads Wuthering will soon forget them. The narrative, especially in the direct first-person segments, impresses with a spare yet lush style. Bronte knows exactly what words are needed to make her points not only clear but memorable - and, in the case of the immaculately worded and brilliantly portrayed last paragraph, simply unforgettable. Hard as the book is to summarize, it is easy to read in the best sense; those who have had trouble getting into other classic works may be at ease, as this is one of the few books as great as it is accessible - which removes the final excuse for the small number who have not already read and loved it. Wuthering Heights is in many ways a remarkable novel, but also a very dark one, which makes it difficult to really love. It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre. This is a story about serious but real human dramas, interpersonal drifts, life turns and twists, psychological struggles and stark socio-temporal distinctions. The morals of this books are multitudinous, multidimensional and indispensable for every human.The author is highly renowned for her elevated style and language, writing with masterly skill, and lively narrative. This book is exciting and interesting, a good combination. If you have ever seen the movie, it doesn't tell half of the story. It stops just as the book gets better! I thought that reading this book would be a burden and a bore. I was wrong, it is now one of my favourite books. Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down. Unlike many, I actually didn't read this book for an English or literature class. And I absolutely loved this. I have never read a book told in such a way as this one is, from the perspective of those who aren't really the main characters; it was such an interesting way of telling the story. The characters were all so intriguing: I loved how I could pity and hate Heathcliff at the same time, and find Cathy frustrating yet endearing. And of course, the love story was passionate, heartbreaking, and engrossing.Regardless of your age, I recommend that you read this book. I'm 14, and this is definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read. My only regret is that Emily Bront? did not write more! I realize this is a classic. I just didn't enjoy reading it. The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another. The ending was suppose to be a happy marriage but it didn't seem joyful, just thank goodness the story ended. This was over many years proclaimed as the greatest romantic novel, the love was too painful for me to be appreciated. I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all. \"Wurthering Heights\" is among the greatest English novels. It is the only novel by Emily Bronte that was published in 1847, one year before the death of the author. It is a tragic romantic story of the tormented love relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. This is a well written moving story which some readers may find too distressing.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff were deeply in love but were destined to be apart. Catherine is a strong willed lady who was on her way up the social ladder. Heathcliff was an orphan who was a waif and was brought to the house by Cathy's father. Cathy and Heathcliff have a strong attraction for each other. However, due to Catherine's social status, she decides to marry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff feels betrayed. From then on, Emily Bronte weaves an intricate plot in a captivating story full of suspense. The story of revenge by Heathcliff is deeply disturbing, violent and shocking.Heathcliff comes out as a man with a demonic character, who is not capable of forgiving someone, is absolutely evil and seeks total destruction of the objects of his hatred. It is difficult to understand the depth of his cruelty and the extreme irrationality of his actions.The book teaches a number of lessons, one of which is the damage that resentment and pride can do to a person as it did to Heathcliff. The author also shows the negative impact of class differences as Catherine cannot embrace Heathcliff for who he is, despite their deep mutual love.This is a compelling and powerful book that left a deep impression on me. The intensity of the emotions exhibited by the main characters is captivating. This powerful and unforgettable novel is highly recommended for those studying English Literature and anyone else who wants to read an interesting and fascinating book. I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair. I have enjoyed &quot;classic&quot; literature in the past but this is unworthy of being dubbed &quot;classic&quot;. I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and &quot;immature&quot; reader. Did not like this at all. The fact that it was short was the only reason I finished it. I am not too sure what the appeal of this book is to others. I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \"Wuthering Heights\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil. This classic by Emily Bronte is a must read. The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate. Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature. You either love him or you hate him. Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad. This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize. The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine. It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter. The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants. Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love. Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet. It can also be selfish and twisted. I bought a set of these books for my 7th grade English class. The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension. I don't know if I will read it again next year because of the grammar, it does suit an older reader, but I do love sharing the story. After we completed the novel, they did complain about the words, but they really loved the story and were sad when we finished the novel. This novel is one to be read for the beauty of the writing and the deeply twisted approach to life. To call it enjoyable would do it a disservice, it's provocative and enthralling. But it's not a love story... I really wish people wouldn't call it a love story. Its a story about thwarted passion and what happens when almost obsessive love is taken to extremes.I started to read on Monday and I have now finished it.. I loved every page but I am completely at a loss as to why Heathcliff is so adored. He isn't a romantic figure especially not in the latter half of the book and Cathy is so selfish and spoilt that they can't be together.Brilliant examination of passion gone wrong but not a romantic novel. A beautifully written story about two families' interconnections. A true piece of art and suspenseful narration make this a page turner. I realize many would contest my opinion in this feverently, and I've argued first hand with many a Wuthering Heights fan, but I have to say with all honesty, this is the worst book I have ever read.The dryness of the plot is second only to the dryness of Emily Bronte's style. For a story attempting to establish themes of love and hatred, passion and apathy, the book is sure dull as hell.I simply can't see any saving quality in this book whatsoever, save the fact that nothing at all happens so you can skim through it without missing a single element of the non-existant plot. The climax of all action within the book is a scene one third of the way in the book where young Heathcliff hurls applesauce at his effeminate and whiny rival, and it just goes even further downhill from there.It is very obvious in her writing that Emily Bronte has never left her home, as her characters are all pallid one-dimensional reflections of her own disgusting parasitic victorian life. Never in a book, even with the most despisable of villans, have I let out such a cheer as a character died, because with the dying of each character in Wuthering Heights there is a feeling of, &quot;FINALLY.&quot; Every character is dying from page 1, in one way or another, and Wuthering Heights is the &quot;journey&quot; of seeing them to their graves, and breathing a sigh of relief, interlaced with mindless whining from one character or another about how the tea and scones are too cold today.If the use of the adjective &quot;Wuthering&quot; is not a warning enough, then read the first five pages. THe only thing I can thank Emily Bronte for is the knowledge that I'll never face pain as great as she has given me in trying to force my way through her book, and I am probably now able to withstand any sort of torture or physical torment by looking back and rememebering, &quot;It could be worse... I could have to listen to Joseph speak again, or Catherine whine.&quot;I realize there's going to be multiple posts debating this, in an &quot;Emperor's New Clothing&quot; sort of fashion of only those who are smart can see the meaning in this book, but the only meaning this book has is what literary critics and English Professors try to stuff it with, no different than the stuffing forcefully injected into a long-dead thanksgiving bird. For a moment, put away your pride, cast down your defensiveness at the view that you're supposed to enjoy this book, and ask yourself: Is there really anything of value in this entire novel? The critical mind will find the answer. The coward will continue to uphold the sanctity of victorian cow-dung. Enjoy your reading :) I know this is a classic, and I understand the value of a female writer at the time, but I found it, at times, hard to follow the characters. I've read this wonderful classic several times. Love the Bronte books. Also just read Jane Eyre. Can't beat the classics. I was very much looking forward to a wonderfully written, romantic classic, but I was disappointed to find that the romance and love is not as moving and touching as I had expected. For one reason, the two main characters who fall in love are dislikable characters. I did not like Catherine or Heathcliff, and this made it very hard for me to enjoy the book. However, despite this, I still enjoyed this book. I do recommend it although I was disappointed. I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me. i thought this was suppose to be one of the greatest love stories ever told but after finishing the book i was left in shock. I can't believe that their would be such an evil person like Heathcliff. I liked the book but just not what i expected. Unlike most students, I did not have the pleasure of reading this classic and well-loved novel at school. And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \"got going\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too. I was just left feeling like there should and could have been more... Nowadays, if we want a good edition of this strangest and strongest of British novels, deeply haunting and intensely poetical in its rather dark and eerie otherness, we have a variety of options, both text-oriented editions or context-oriented (\"study\") ones.To name them all (see my overall review on the Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn)): Oxford World's Classics (Patsy Stoneman), Penguin Classics (Pauline Nestor), Oneworld Classics, among the text-oriented ones;Longman Cultural (Alison Booth), Broadview Press (Beth Newman), Norton Critical Third or Fourth ((Sale)/Dunn) among the context-oriented ones.But when it comes to choose a good-looking hardcover volume, it turns out to be an impossible task to get the right text with an adequate annotation (it seems as if nobody cared for it!).Oxford's World's Classics Special Centennial pocket hardcover issue, now very hard to come by, is a most lovable volume and features the Clarendon reference text, but we add a rather unperceptive and dull Introduction to an absolute absence of notes to get as a result a perfectly useless edition.Barnes & Noble is a really nice hardcover, together with a good Introduction (Daphne Merkin) and a very good annotation (Tatiana Holway), but theirs, while a reliable and well-known text (Haworth Edition, 1900), is a 1850 second edition text, that is to say, Charlotte's highly tampered-with posthumous edition, further disfigured at the hands of the Publisher. Many people think -as I do- that thistext-form is a no-go.Now we come to the Franklin Mint 1979 edition (and its version for Oxford University). It's a very beautiful hardcover volume, leatherette on boards that really looks at least like bonded leather, with all edges gold-gilt, with an excellent125 gram per square meter almost opaque paper (without mineral loading);an excellent quality two-color printing with 11/14 pt Linotype Garamond type and ornate chapter initials. It features the beautiful if not daring Alan Reingold five double-page lithographs with its photographic-like impact...And then what? The text -forgetting for a moment Clarendon and its derivatives-is a very good 1847 first edition text (in the line of SCHORER's, Moser's and Daiches's editions), and it features -for the first time in the novel history- a full and right footnote glossing of the dialectal tirades.Any misgivings? O...yes! Two little ones:a) the Charlotte prefaces should come at the end of the novel rather than at the beginning, not to condition our reading, andb) there is no modern good introduction to the novel (and there were by then a great deal many very good to excellent ones from where to choose); and a very big one:c) the absence of any note whatsoever other than the dialect glosses.Now, it's up to you to choose (and, should you go for this, do a little looking around to get the best preserved copy within your budget).Within its constraints, it's a very nice book and an interesting buy! digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!! There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended. The characters found in this novel are simply the most despicable appalling people imaginable. The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters. I spent most of my life avoiding books like this. Now, nearing 50, I have been finding that many of these old English novels are great fun and can occasionally even be very moving (&quot;Silas Marner&quot; knocked me clean out!). What you will find distinctive about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is its surprising violence. The title tells it all: Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down. You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession. Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul. You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates. Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth? Will the violence follow its winding path ever downward? Ah, but that's for you to discover. Hunker down and go for it. This ain't no sippin' novel. If you think this is going to be anything like Jane Austen, you are in for a wonderful surprise (I'm in the minority of women everywhere in that I hate her guts)... reading \"Wuthering Heights\" is an very visceral experience. The story crashes along with melodrama and emotional episodes galore; and when you set all that against the impossibly lonely and picturesque backdrop of the English moors, it's enough to snare any romantic heart. I won't give you the particulars of the plot... it is at its core a love story, but also a great deal more complicated than that. The relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is all at once pure, spiritual, sexy, intensely stormy and destructive, in a way I've never seen done before in fiction.This is one novel that I feel like I could read over and over, submerge myself in the minds of each of the characters multiple times, and still not plumb the depth of its meaning. The writing is gorgeous, of course, with complexly-constructed but damn near-perfect sentences. This is an emotional, overwhelming, entirely un-sedate book -- a remarkable thing to emerge from Victorian times, from the impenetrable mind of a reclusive female poet. We'll never know what Emily Bronte was truly like, but she was clearly an incredible artist who deserved vastly more recognition than she ever got in her lifetime. The words positively thrum with passion. Truly incredible. ...when you have nobody to love you...lonely like the devil and envious like him...nobody will cry for you when you die!I don't consider &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be a love story or simply a book about love, hate, and revenge, as it is often wrongfully described by many. I dare not say this is a social work either, but it is somehow concerned with broad issues such as social and familial oppression, the subordination and the disadvantaged nature of female lives at that time, the brutality of the patriarchal power, the unjustices of the inheritance law, etc. The most striking thing about this book is that it is concerned with extremities like love and hate, human and animal, life and death, masters and servants, earthly and divine.Of course the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is maybe one of the main things of, at least, the first part of this work: they're like almost two waterdrops, both showing a fondness for freedom and nature. But their relationship (I don't know why I hesitate to call it love) is kind of dysfunctional, for lack of a better word. Maybe it's because of the lack of a mother for both of them, maybe because of their upbringing in an atmosphere of patriarchal brutality.And maybe it's not a pure coincidence that Heathcliff's origins are obscure: when he first appears at Wuthering Heights he is dirty, ragged, starving and houseless, ill-treated by the patriarchal and he is refused education. As a critic simply put it, Wuthering Heights can hardly be described as a social novel, but it deals with many social themes, as Heathcliff might be seen as a representative of, maybe not the dispossessed, but at least of the oppressed; on the other hand Edgar reads a great deal, but his reading seems more a means of escape from the emotional turmoil which surrounds him rather than a pleasure per se. Besides, towards the end of the story, Cathy begins to educate Hareton, which later leads them to falling in love, as preposterous as this might seem earlier in the book: their previous enmity and hatred has been forsaken in favour of union through learning. Interestingly, as this is happening, Heathcliff, formally the force for energy (not a positive one), now acknowledges the draining of this energy and the lost of his faculty of enjoying their destruction and his being too idle to destroy for nothing (I have to remind myself to breathe-almost to remind my heart to beat: conscience has turned my heart to an earthly hell).If the first part of this work depicts a fierce and passionate but also binary view of the Yorkshire moors society, the second part of it is about reconciliation, education, development and, thus, progress. At the end of the book the powers are much more balanced, the relationship between sexes more egalitarian, as E. Bront seems to emphasize the need of the society to develop and move forward with necessary cohesion.Or at least this is the way I see this novel, much more a social work rather than simply a book about love, hate and revenge, and that's what makes it, in my opinion, one of the best of its time. But hey, every reader may see and interprete it his or her own way: I guess this too is the beauty of literature, as that of music and art in general. When you read it, make a chart showing the relationships between the characters, arranged in three rows (one row per generation). Also be alert for her intelligent, subtle, and pitiless sense of humor (&quot;Joseph's head appeared in the window.&quot;).The book works on all levels, including eloquent and sometimes beautiful prose (check out the last paragraph first, which won't ruin the plot for you). It will get re-read by me more than anything else except maybe Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.I wish I could have had the privilege of having the friendship of the author, who was an accomplished pianist, famous in her neighborhood for her bread, and once beat a dog senseless with her bare hands. This is a timeless classic. It's a wonderful tale, but so hard to understand.Sometimes I didn't know who was \"talking.\" You get the idea of the story though. MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK, NOVEL ETC, OF ALL TIMES, HANDS DOWN. I RE-READ AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR. LOVE IT Emily Bronte is one of those authors who has an extreme grip on the English language, and I just loved having this on my Kindle to read at my leisure. This was a great buy for the price, and the fact is that Bronte is always good to read. Everytime I read this novel I find something different; makes me feel something different. I read it every winter and enjoy it everytime. This is a true classic. No movie has ever done it justice. The parallel structure within the characters' genealogical table is phenomenal.Highly Recommended.James Conroyd Martin, Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Push Not the River This is a classic book. Emily Bronte has taken a love story and put her own twist on it. If anyone had studied the book in High School will tell you, the irony is simplistic. I loved it back then, and after reading it again I loved it even more. There were things I didn't understand back then that made more sense. Since I've been married for 20 years now, I understand the meaning of true love. Read it again if it has been so long, reanalyze it and decide for yourself. I thought it was good. I really enjoyed reading this book for my college English class. Over all I give it 3 stars Although Wuthering Heights is written in very old english and is not easy to read, the story itself is very touching, romantic and parts of it is tragic.Heathcliff, an orphan, is raised by Mr Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrivle vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.This is a book which gets quite intense and the relationships between the characters get quite complicated but it is a good book to read. Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visits Heathcliff his landlord and the latter says \"walk in\" in a manner that sounds like \"go to the deuce\" to Lockwood. When Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights for the second time the area sees heavy snow and he is marooned there over night with Miltonian ice and snow around him, his hades complete with a half dozen four footed fiends like the hounds of hell inside. Catherine is even pretending to weave some black arts to tease Joseph. So we see that Bronte has painted us a picture of hell at Wuthering heights with, as we shall see later, Thrushcross Grange it's polar opposite. Dante Rossetti said of this novel: \"The action is laid in Hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\"After retiring for the night Lockwood reads the names Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, Catherine Linton written on a window ledge. This series of names tells the story of Catherine Earnshaw to her relationship to Heathcliff and then to marriage to Edgar Linton, read in the opposite direction it is the story of her daughter Catherine Linton who marries a Heathcliff and ends up an Earnshaw. Lockwood goes to sleep and dreams of going with Joseph to hear a Reverend Jabes Branderham preach on Seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first which was in a book he had been reading, and that Catherine had scribbled in. In a truly funny scene Lockwood is exposed as the first of the seventy first sinner: \"'Thou art the man!' cried Jabes ... Brethren, execute upon him the judgement written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me\".Bronte paints in Heathcliff as a goblin that digs up graves and torments the living but she also lets us look a little deeper and we see his torment at the loss of Catherine. Symbolically, I suppose, Wuthering Heights represents Romanticism in decline while Thrushcross Grange depicts the emerging Victorian values. Bronte gives us two main narrators Nelly Dean and Lockwood and we see most of the story through their eyes. Virginia Woolf said \"It is as if Emily Bront could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.\" Emily Bronte's numinous and gothic Wuthering Heights compasses a literary zenith as the finest English novel. Wuthering Heights is definitely worth a re-read. Tho most of us read it in school itis worth reading again. In my opinion it's one of the best ever written. Read the backgroundof the Brontes and you will appreciate the worth of this novel. This story is very well written and told. It arrived in great time and shape. I have just recently finished the book Wuthering Heights and have found it is a very interesting book.In the novel, Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood the story of Mr. Heathcliff, who is the landlord of the houses Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Mr. Heathcliff was a young, poor child when he was adopted into the rich Earnshaw household. As Heathcliff grew up he fell in love with Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of Mr. Earnshaw, and loved her throughout the rest of the novel. Once Catherine is old enough she decides to marry Edgar Linton for his social status (i.e. money, looks), and hopes to bring Heathcliff up out of the power of her brother Hindley. Heathcliff regrets her decision and runs away for three years.When Heathcliff comes back he is very wealthy and wishes to see Catherine after his time away for so long. After meeting with Catherine, Heathcliff is very upset at the fact that she married Mr. Edgar Linton. Heathcliff finds out that Isabella, Edgars sister, has fallen in love with him and he thinks it will be a perfect way to get revenge on not only on Catherine, but also Edgar Linton. Heathcliff marries Isabella and takes her to live and Wuthering Heights with him, where she is quite miserable due to the lack of hospitality. During this time period Catherine dies after she has her daughter Cathy, and Heathcliff is miserable because he never got to show his love towards her. At this point Isabella runs off to Gimmerton, the local village, and has a child named Linton which she asks her brother to come pick up so that Heathcliff could not torture him with the anger he had towards Isabella. After Edgar picks up Linton, Isabella dies and Edgar comes back to the Grange. The next day Nelly brings Linton over to the Heights because Heathcliff says its \"his property\". Young Cathy falls in love with her cousin Linton, even though he is always sick and moaning, and eventually marries him. Linton dies one night and Heathcliff taks control over both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy falls in love with Hareton, son of Hindley Earnshaw, and marries him. Heathcliff eventually dies and everyone lives happily ever after.I personally wouldn't have picked up this book myself if it was up to me, but my teacher had us read it in his class and im glad i did. Compared to Wuthering Heights, not any other novel has seemed so hard. The first time I read this book, I was 11. It was fairly interesting but I didn't give it any second thoughts. Five years later, I pick it up again and finish it in a day. I am so in love with this book. I keep rereading it over and over again and each time it only gets better. Wuthering Heghts is one of those books that you wish you could read for the first time again. I truly recommend it. You have to give it some time in the beginning but it really is fantastic. Four stars. The personage of Mr. Lockwood makes a slightly unsatisfactory and unnecessary narrator and is my only qualm. The remainder of the story is staggeringly brilliant; I've encountered nothing like it before. Where can one even begin on this book? I have just a few seconds ago finished this book and I am completely speechless...but not with admiration.Yes,PERHAPS Emily Bronte might have written this well but EVERY other aspect of this books is extremely flawed. Good literature it may be to some but good characters, morals, story it is most certainly not. I completely 100% agree with a reviewer who wrote that she hated Heathcliff being described as some alpha male. Reader, believe me, he is the farthest thing from it. How can all these people talk about WH as being a love story? Some call it Powerful Love, Passionate Love, Strongest Love that Could Ever Exist, etc etc. Believe me when I say Heathcliff has ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE for Catherine. Nor she for him. All of it is just a matter of obsession. Their \"attachment\" to each other is purely selfish. This book has not ONE admirable character in it. All are either foolish or wicked. Heathcliff is nothing good and honest but obsession, jealousy, cruelty, baseness, dishonesty, and selfishness are the elements of his character as well as Catherine's I might add. Perhaps if Emily Bronte would have brought out all the folly of the characters and spoken of their error it would have had some merit. But the book starts off in bad and till the end no one grows or improves their moral characters. If the wickedness of a person can only be erased by extinguishing the the person himself what moral is there to be learned at all? I had not the slightest big of emotion except relief when I finished this. When I read a book I feel so engrossed in it, almost as if I know every character and am part of their world. HA! Emily Bronte has such a superb power of making you feel like you are only reading blank words on a page...I felt no connection with the characters at all. This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text. Rather than spend even 99 cents on this version, get the Project Gutenberg download of Wuthering Heights for the Kindle. It is better formatted and free. Of all of the audio books of Wuthering Heights, this is my favorite. Janet McTeer brings the characters of Cathy and Heathcliff to life and fully captures the wild passion and pain of the novel. The Patricia Routledge audio play is quite good, as well, but if you are looking for a reading of the complete text of the novel, this is by far the best. Wuthering Heights tells the immensly passionate tale of betrayal, sorrow and unrequited love. It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature. I thought that this was an interesting book. It wasn't the best book that I've ever read, but it was okay. I thought that the story was very dramatic, and tragic. I loved the language that is used throughout the book. I would recommend it only if you like drama, and romance.This book follows many stories, of basically 3 families. This story gets really complicated. It's really hard to explain without spoiling the book. The best way that I can explain, is that a rich girl falls in love with a servant, and is \"not allowed\" to be with him, because of the standards of the time, (the late 1700s). The story follows the lives of these two individuals and what happens to them in their lives.Like I said before, this was an interesting plot. I have seen the movie with Laurence Olivier, and I have to say I like the movie better, but I did see the movie first. I think that you should give this book a try and find out for yourself what you think of \"Wuthering Heights\". Although some of the plot elements seem preposterous today the story remains a great read. What a love story! A great tale of people sometimes setting in motion awful events due to their desire to do what they see as right in their own eyes. Recommended. Well-written. There's no redeemable quality in either Heathcliff or Catherine. The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we? This book is not a love story. It is about all consuming passion. Anyone who says otherwise fails to understand the true meaning of the novel. I'm not going to waste time stating the general plot premise. This story is a classic and the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is well known.Wuthering Heights is about classicism, torture and religion. Heathcliff is a representation of the devil. The entire story focuses on getting into Heaven or Hell and being smiled upon by providence. The love between Cathy and Heathcliff is the quintessential abusive relationship. The main characters are not likable; they are repulsive and cruel. The estate of Wuthering Heights (and by virtue of its name) is the focal point of the ever changing social dynamics (from Heathcliff and Catherine to their respective children).It sounds like I hated this book but in fact I loved it! It shows the raw and sadistic elements of human beings and the need for kindness and compassion. The writing is exceptionally eloquent, although it takes the reader forty pages to get caught up in the characters. Wuthering Heights is a moving masterpiece. Please read this book. You will not regret it. and better than any Hollywood production. One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted \"proper behavior\" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator. She is the most likeable character in the story but not very realistic. I have never been into the lovey-dovey, romantic stuff, but Wuthering Heights is just amazing. It's a classic and always will be an amazing story. The story just grabs your attention and never lets go. One of my absolute favorite quotes is from this book. It's a shame they don't make books like they did back then. \"If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he was annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.\" Everytime I read this novel I find something different; makes me feel something different. I read it every winter and enjoy it everytime. I loved this book! Definately kept me interested and wanting to read more. I would buy more books from this author. In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read. Wuthering Heights is beautifully written. I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. Ruben Toledo's cover is even more gorgeous than the Amazon picture portrays, and the pages and binding are high quality. I definitely plan to purchase the rest of these Deluxe Editions that Penguin has released. I read Wuthering Heights for first time when i was 12 years old.Now I`m 18 and I`m still reading this book.And at everytime i read it, I can`t hold myself from crying. I think I read it for at least one hundred times.It is the best love story ever written.from the first chapter, it starts to effect you and you cannot give it up till you wil finish it.At each chapter you start to ask yourself &quot;what will happens?, what will he or she do?&quot; or questions like this.I want to say here if you want to read it, don`t think anything.Buy it and read it.you will see that it will become your bedside book.I can`t describe it in words because i can`t find the best words to describe it.It is the best book.I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO DECRIBE IT. Gah! This book is the most horrible thing I've read! Heathcliff is a horrible character! I didn't know I was ever suppose to root for him. He borders on crazy and even crazier. No one should be forced to read this dren. I'd rather be waterboardered than read this again...at least the psychological scars of waterboarding wouldn't last as long! This is a no frills original classic. Its so refreshing to read a classic as it was originally written. Great value. In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part.

And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read. This compelling story of hate has enthralled readers for generations with good reason. From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \"moral\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title. First of all, this is one of my all-time favorite books. Wuthering Heights in general gets 5 stars from me, and there are plenty of other opinions about the story for you to read. I just want to add something about this particular edition, because it made me laugh in surprise when I opened up my package. This edition is very elegant, but it's very different from your average hard-backed novel. It's very compact and the pages are very thin, like a pocket Bible. The only reason I don't like it so much is that since the pages are so thin you can see the ghost of the words of the preceding page through the page you're reading. You get used to it as you read, but I prefer a print of more substance. Other than that, the cover is pretty, it's hard-backed, the pages are edged in gold coloring and it comes with an attached ribbon bookmark. The print is also average sized, so it's definitely readable, and the small size is advantageous if you want to carry it with you in a purse or on a trip. In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England.

And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read. i have to confess this was the first book to whet forever my craving for darkness. it seems so light and brainy after years; but then i can go back and read again and again, now it only takes an hour or two, and each read it pulls me back into that original mood like giant vultures' wings slowly flapping over me. heathcliff is of course the most truthful embodiment of a woman's fantasy. emily dug far down, long before evolution was the buzz word, when all we knew was that adam and eve fell, and emily knew the coldness of life's force. my professors, one of these i'm thinking of male, the other female, dismissed my theory as misreading of a revolutionily defiant woman. how can they be so far from their own guts? the worse was the male professor, a diehard wimp-roaster who was jealous of heathcliff's hardness and fevered coldness. even my deep love kate bush missed the mood with her whininess of \"heathcliff it's me Cathy i'm coming home now\"--so much sentimentality! emily goes further into any heart of darkness that light and cheery old joseph ever could dare. even though this masterpiece has seemed airier and brighter now i've dipped further, in other works, it is so strong it can still trick me back into its spell. I am still trying to read this book. I have no idea what is going on. Not an interesting book to me. A little slow starting but the mystery of it holds you. Then Wuthering Heights picks up speed.In, time, very satisfying. I gave this book 4 stars because after having read it 1 week ago I'm still thinking about it. I still can't decide whether I loved it or hated it. Many people think this book to be about love but I think it's about the opposite...hate. Pure evil takes shape in this book in Heathcliff. Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine is palpable and turns him mad with hatred for everyone and everything in his path. This book is dark, cold, unfeeling and wicked. The death can almost be felt and smelled from the pages. If you enjoy books about death, illness, hatred and obsessive love then this book is for you. I started reading this book as part of my catch-up-with-the-classics campaign. And it was supposed to be full of smoldering passion, etc., etc. I read on and on and on - nothing. Did I miss something, I don't think so. Up until now, I could have said I've never met a book I didn't like. The best I can say - I didn't find it offensive. Just dull beyond belief. Read Dickens if you want to see an author go on and on not losing your interest and actually making a point. Read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; if you want some to feel some real passion about teaching and love and life. The savings were beaucoup! This was a required reading book for school. The price was great, the delivery was quick, and the book was in great condition! Thanks! Wuthering Heights is a Emily Bronte classic and no matter how many times you read it, it is always spectacular. Yes. I agree. This book is compelling and atmospheric. I love the hints of the supernatural. Heathcliffe's lycanthropic qualities. Almost a werewolf on the moonlit moors. The ghostly hauntings and the attentions to and realisations of character's dreams are all very effective. I also like the dichotomy between the two houses. Wuthering Heights is a veritable Hell and Thrushdown Grange is Heaven. BUT... I have never encountered such an utterly repellant motley crew of characters in my life! Who on Earth could have ANY feelings for these people? Heathcliffe is a mad-dog that needs putting to sleep. Hindley is an abusive, maniacal drunkard. Joseph is an hysterical religious bigot. Catherine is a pain... But, worst of all none of the characters show any inclination to extricate themselves from their mess. Rather, they actively encourage each other's dissolution and disarray. There is no-one in the book strong enough or intelligent enough to check these processes of atrophy and attrition. How pointless, don't you think? And for all the reviewers who defend this book with the charge that real-life is similarly evil... Well, yeah, maybe real life according to Jerry Springer and his idiot dysfunctional redneck guests. I found these characters so repellant and downright sinister I couldn't stop thinking of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady. An interesting read. Love is a great and terrible killer in the end. And there are many lessons to be learned from the story. Wuthering Heights was a very good book although there seemed to be some typos that could have been avoided when editing. Its been a long time since I've fully been engrossed in a novel-for some time, I've worked my way through books, flipping a few pages forward so I could see when the chapter would end and I could find something better to entertain myself with. This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death. I had avoided Wuthering Heights because I thought it was purely a love story and a corny one at that. Pleasantly surprised is a tremendous understatement. This was fantastic. There is no scene - in the book at least - with Heathcliff and Catherine running into each other's arms across the moors. That must have been from a sappy movie version. In fact, there are no scenes like that - no mindless romantic drivel at all. The preface of my copy actually said that the book was not that successful during Bronte's time because the characters were altogether \"too odiously and abominably pagan to suit the tastes of even the most shameless class of English readers\" (as stated by the Quarterly Review).It is certainly dark. Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff who, spurned by Catherine, wreaks havoc on the lives of everyone who has ever had anything to do with him, covering three generations. Is it a love story? Well, yes ... sort of. Catherine did passionately love Heathcliff (as he did her) but nothing ever comes of that, at least in the traditional sense. The extent of Wuthering Heights being a love story to me is the inevitable question of \"If Catherine had married Heathcliff would things have been different?\" Given the almost demoniacal personality Heathcliff bears throughout the book, I hardly think so.If you have only ever seen the movie, you have only heard half of the story - literally - and that is extremely \"brightened\" from the novel's intrinsic dark and spooky overtones. This is one of those books when finished, I found myself wandering around saying, \"Wow, that was a good book\". I even waited a few days before starting another. It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too! This printing is rife with errors. It is also a bit disturbing that the cover looks more like Psycho house than any description of Wuthering Heights; clearly the artist who created the cover has never read the book. By all means, read this gothic classic, but pay a bit more and get a decent printing (even the one with the \"Stephenie Meyers cover\" would be preferable to this sorry edition). You can't go wrong with the Bronte sisters when in the mood for a romantic novel. The characters are complex and compelling. The book took me forever to read it seems. I usually can read a short story like this in a day or two but it took me nearly two weeks to finish this one. I did enjoy the story and I will definitely recommend to other readers. Everyone should have the pleasure of reading Wuthering Heights. There is little I can add to the body of work devoted to this excellent novel. But who doesn't love Healthcliff - the prototype for all tortured, romantic souls after him. A wonderful read that should be required for all. Bronte, like all great authors, is as much psychologist is she is an artist, and her writing could even be placed quite neatly, if one so wished, under the mantle of the attachment theories that came after her time. From what I can gather, it is commonly considered that the primary theme of Wuthering Heights is a type of love that transcends all else. Great passion, transcending mortal life, consuming one's soul. Something noble in and of itself, more powerful than reason. Supposedly, this somehow partially excuses any evil stemming from it. Heathcliff is seen as having a wild, passionate, \"bad boy\" attraction.If one reads quickly, without really absorbing it all, some scenes do give Heathcliff this allure. But integrating all that he does, he is too evil. And in the end, nothing but deranged evil. His deranged, so-called love excuses nothing. Nor does the mistreatment he received excuse mistreating innocent bystanders. Though it does show insight that abuse tends to engender hatred of life and abuse of others.In his resentment, Heathcliff destroys all rational values in search of some personal satisfaction which is too mean and limited to ever make him happy. Such a man cannot love himself or anyone else. He may have an obsession for something of his imagination, but not appreciation for real people and the give and take of real relationships. Bad treatment may have led to him becoming a monster, but once a monster, he must be recognized as a monster.At that time Bronte was writing, in the 1840's, mystical notions of other worldly love and passions and existence were fairly common. But they are irrational nonetheless.I reject the popular view of the book's theme, whether Emily Bronte intended that theme or not. I think the story illustrates the theme of people being responsible for their own choices and suffering the unexpected consequences of their actions. In other words, the story does not glorify some superior love, but actually ridicules the delusion of it.The idea that souls of loved ones will be reunited after death is common. However, this is a spiritual thing; so, Heathcliff's desire to have the coffins opened on the side makes no sense in this light. He was simply deranged. How Bronte thought up such a thing is strange. Perhaps the idea is that Heathcliff is not spiritual enough, not properly religious, to imagine the mystic reuniting of souls? So he imagines a more physical reuniting?Bronte, as shown by her poetry, seems enamored with notions of life after death; so, it is difficult to know what she felt about life. There is evidence both that she enjoyed it and that she hated it. I wonder if she didn't simply have different moods? Anyway, she was often intelligent and insightful about the natures of different types of people, and Wuthering Heights is cleverly and inventively presented. The ending, which implies that the new generation will find lasting love and happiness, saves the book. I also liked the way religion was shown to be of no positive use for anything, which I doubt was Bronte's intention, but engenders meaness and abuse. I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that. A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS. How wonderful that great literature such as this can be made so accessible. I love this book. Everyone should read this to become aware how we can be our worst enemies. Self awareness is a dear and valuable virtue. I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \"little\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it! This book's among the best i've ever read. All those who don't like it must be basing their opinion on the dreadful 1992 film adaptation instead of reading the actual book. I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \"little\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it! This is a great classic read. It is a dark book with a good ending. If you look at the background of each character, you'll understand how they have come to act the way they do in the book. Maybe to the extreme in their actions and hatred, but you can see cause and effect to the situations that occur. Also, if you read about Bronte, you can see why the book is so dark. She had not such a happy life. I wish Bronte would have written more books. Again, a great book. Is there anybody out there who hasn't heard of Heathcliff, the dark villian/hero of this high pitched and utterly committed work of madness? Oh, I love it. It was difficult for me at first. I'm a writer, but not a natural reader. But once I was into this book, once I stopped asking questions of the narrative and just entered the shadowy world of Catherine and her doomed household, I was quite literally spellbound. Bronte died believing this book was a failure. What a dreadful irony that this quiet, disciplined woman who lived out her life in a cold parsons' house with her brilliant sisters, her drunken brother and her eccentric father (The man memorized Paradise Lost: imagine. And outlived all his children!) never even had an inkling that this outpouring of her heart and soul would become a classic, overshadowing even her sister's highly successful Jane Eyre. Both Bronte sisters had the capacity to create archetypes -- to imprint upon the culture seminal patterns that endure to the present time. One last point: the father was Irish. Madness and genius in the blood, indeed. Enjoy it. I read it over every year or so, sometimes twice in a row. I study it; I watch all the film versions. I just love it, the way it works, its strange cruelty and enchantment. I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion. At first, I found the story confusing what with the two Catherines but once I got a grasp on what was going on, I was swept away. 'Wuthering Heights' is amazing. The story is intense and passionate. It makes a bold statement on bi-racial love, class and cultural barriers, and revenge. My most favorite character is the most evil of them all - Heathcliff. His story just shows how much damage resentment, pride and revenge can do to a human being. It is a timeless lesson. The only negative of this book is that the relationship between Catherine, the younger and Hareton feels underdeveloped. It just happens too quickly. Otherwise, I think the ending is appropriate. The younger characters don't repeat the mistake of their elders. Too bad they're cousins. It gives the story a twisted, perverted edge. In the end, though, this book is most certainly worth the read. The story is captivating, suspenseful and intense. When you read it, you don't know what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading to find out. A genuine treat. Highly recommended. Wuthering Heights is a book about love and forgiveness. Emily Bronte keeps our attention through the passion of the main characters and powerful quotes such as, \"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be.....Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in mind: not as a pleasure......but as my own being.\"Bronte's book starts out kind of slow, but as you continue reading through, the story picks up and captures your attention. The dynamic of the characters and their relationships with one another brings such enthusiasm to the story that as you read through, you find yourself becoming a part of the story- you find yourself wanting to tell Nelly Dean to speak up and stop withholding information and you want talk to Catherine and tell her to give Heathcliff a chance and you want to tell Heathcliff that he needs to forgive so many people in his life so that he can have a chance at a real and peaceful life! Bronte does an excellent job bringing her characters to life.The story also has an element of surprise woven throughout- which keeps you coming back to continue reading through each chapter. Bronte goes through three generations of this particular family in a way that is captivating and exciting. As the story unfolds you get to see how each character is related to the other while discovering why they are like they are- you realize why Heathcliff is so bitter and why Hareton is so under-educated and why young Catherine is living with her father-in-law and cousins.The ending is not as satisfying as the rest of the book, but it does end in a uniquely mysterious way.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&nodeID;= Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is by far the best novel I have ever read. The novel's main characters--Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff--are ingeniously written, and the melodramatic scenes are not too \"cheezy\" for the modern audience. Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature. I am indeed lost for words...a book of unprecedented power and imaginative scope. I attempted to read this in school, but unfortunately was stymied by the opening chapters. Now many years later I have again found this truly remarkable novel. Its style ranges smoothly from horridly wicked, to loving and caring, to darkly comedic. Heathcliff is perhaps one of the most wretched characters in literature, and his love affair with Catherine is truly unique. This is almost like \"Jerry Springer\" for the 19th century. If you skipped this in school, do yourself a favor and pick it up again. Enjoying a great novel sometimes requires a willingness to accept confusion, at least initially. Many readers who have trouble appreciating &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are put off by the work's first 50 pages. The novel begins with a focus on a fastidious hypochnodriac who is not actually the main character and who never even has a first name: Mr. Lockwood, a tidy little man who enjoys observing love from a distance but is terrified by its proximity. He has no idea what's in store for him. Urged by his doctor to rest his over-wrought nerves, Mr. Lockwood rents a beautful manor in the apparently idyllic Yorkshire moors of northeast England, a decision he will soon both deeply regret and enjoy. In the novel's opening pages, Bronte successfully integrates Mr. Lockwood's mistaken conclusions with the reader's: 1)Mr. Heathcliff must be a gentleman [He isn't]; (2)The young lady by the hearth must be Heathcliff's wife or perhaps that of the coarse young man who also lives there [She's neither; she's actually a widow, and the coarse young man should be the house's master]; and (3)Catherine Earnshaw is a spectral demon with the power to return to earth in order to continue terrorizing those whom she once loved [Maybe she is; maybe it's only a dream], and so on. All of these errors in judgment are completely understandable, and during the course of the novel they are all satisfactorily explained. But initially, the situation Mr. Lockwood, as well as the reader, encounters is very, very confusing. Mr. Lockwood gets nearly everything wrong, and to a reader accustomed to lucid foreshadowing, Lockwood's mistakes are perplexing. What IS going on in this strange, strange house? Confusing the reader, however, is actually part of Bronte's strategy to transport Lockwood, and the reader as well, to a world of pure imagination, a realm of stormy passion where all thoughts are expressed in poetic speech (regardless of the damage they may cause), a world where one character is another character as well (&quot;Nelly, I am Heathcliff&quot;)--in short, a world that would be utterly abhorrent to the reader's rational faculties but proves irresistibly attractive to his emotional and aesthetic dimensions. So the novel's first few pages deliberately disorient the reader, encouraging him to abandon an everyday world where the apparent equals the reality, where most sane people restrain themselves, spending most of their days and nights in balanced, rational pursuits. Bronte's novel, restricted geographically to the Heights and the Grange, is a buttonhole in reality, through which the reader slips without fully realizing it from a more or less rational environment into a world where ghosts are not entirely unexpected, lovers dig up the corpse of their beloved, drunken louts drop their babies from stair landings, middle-aged men repeatedly curse--even brutally batter--younger women, and lovers punish each other to prove the depth of their love. &quot;Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot; Bronte's world would disintegrate if it were evaluated by generally accepted rational, moral precepts. Bronte instinctively realizes this fact and, within a matrix of purposeful confusion, seductively transports the reader from an everyday world of clearly articulated right and wrong where love is primarily a dalliance into one where love consumes entirely, lasts well beyond mere physical death, and is not the least bit concerned with traditional concepts of right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, acceptable or unacceptable. With meticulous attention to specific details and complex time frames, Bronte ultimately explains away all of Mr. Lockwood's and the reader's initial misunderstandings. If the reader--allowing for some intentional confusion in the novel's opening pages--continues reading, he will be rewarded by Bronte's ability to transport him into an utterly fascinating but repulsive, familiar but impossible world that is the essence of imaginative literature. Bronte's novel--populated by comic and tragic characters, set in beautiful but deadly landscapes, focused on restrained civility juxtaposed with passionate intensity--undoubtedly deserves its rank among the world's greatest romances and imaginative literary creations. The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \"Why not 5 stars?\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been. Wuthering Heights is, frankly, a disaster of a novel. Examining it from a technical point of view, the narration is stilted and poor, the characters are flat, the writing is childish, and it's much too bloated. The entire story could have been summed up into about forty pages or less, and I think it would have been more \"passionate\" and surely much more believable if Emily Bront had written the book in third person, not first person.Mr. Lockwood begins narrating the story, which is perfectly fine. I'd thought it would be a normal first-person narrative, until I discovered that the true narrator is Nelly Dean. In everyday speech, or even in telling a lengthy story (as Nelly is), no one actually speaks like they're writing a book (\"'Yes,' she said, looking at me.\"). People speak like, well, people. They stammer and stumble and interrupt themselves, especially when they're trying to narrate a story. Now, this sort of stilted narration is tolerable for a certain period of time--- the real issue I have with this book is that each and every character has the same style of speech. Each of these flat, poorly developed characters speak and narrate in the exact same way--- except for Joseph and the other uneducated characters, whose rare bouts of dialogue are generally incomprehensible.Heathcliff is supposedly the main character, but he is anything but a hero...although I do admit he is the most human. That doesn't say much, however. I really can't imagine any of the characters being portrayed as heroes. And the ancillary 'narrator,' Mr. Lockwood, is nothing but a stand-in for Nelly Dean. Of all the characters, he is the flattest, and he seems to have very little purpose in the story.To top all that off, the story isn't nearly as \"amazing\" as it's made out to be. It is advertised as revealing some of the \"terrible truths about men and women,\" but the characters are so unrealistic and childish that I can't even think of them as being true men and women. 95% of them fail to act their ages, by the way. The book is about thwarted love, yes, I understand. But the passion is just as believable as the characters are, and there is a disturbing lack of justice in the story. The whole book screams, \"Who cares?!\"Overall, I don't recommend Wuthering Heights to anyone, even though it is hailed (for whatever reason) as being a work of searing beauty and one of the most wonderful classics today. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, technically and metaphorically and creatively speaking. But who knows--- you may enjoy it.[EDIT: This review expresses my opinion about this book...my opinion only, and nothing more. I don't think it's mature for people to make illogical judgments (for instance, \"people who thought Wuthering Heights was badly written aren't such great writers themselves\") about others simply because they do not agree with them about a book. Everyone is entitled his/her own opinion, and therefore, no opinion is right or wrong.] I really like this book. I can't even explain why. It's quite the downer and the characters make you frustrated, but I LOVE it. You really feel what the characters feel. You get frustrated for them. You pull for them when you really shouldn't. You want it to work out for them even though you know it's impossible. It's a love story without a happy ending, but also a twisted happy ending at the same time. Twisted is a good way to describe a lot of this book. But I loved it with all it's twistiness. The achievement of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne is an unprecedented phenomenon in English literature. I've always thought of what lessons could modern parents learn from the raising of the Bronte sisters, in years when education was not a recognized priority in women's life, and yet no girls of the Bronte family was left behind. Amazing, wasn't it?It is unnatural to review this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre, another masterpiece of the Bronte sisters. I tend to put both of the two book in high rank, regardless of critiques from different directions. Jane Eyre is admirable for the ambition that is high but not wild, the emotion that is heated but not burned, the action that is courageous but not aggressive, and the totality of natural elegance and inner nobality. While Wuthering Heights is the opposite to the extreme. In WH, the ambition is wild but not high, the emotion is burned before it get's comfortably heated, and the action is often violently aggressive yet not courageous. The boundaries of humanity is ignored, the nobality is not admired or even hated, and the anger is allowed to vent at any cost.Said that, it is a great worth to read for the craftsman of the storyline and the superior language skills. It depicts deviated, obsessive, violent, and destructive personalities that need psychiatric help in my opinion. If it is just for the sake of reading a good novel, I would give WH and JE the same score. However, due to the fact one can not realistically seperate the entertaining effect from educating effect of any literal work, I would like to save the highest score for the truely and entirely best. This book was mentioned in several of the other books that i have read so I thought I would see why it was referenced so much. I really liked this book. Emily creates these characters that have depth and strong emotions. Cathrine and Heathcliff are doomed from the get go, their chilhood spares them no humanity for them to retain in adulthood. Heathcliff is horrible and is often referred to a an evil man, true but Cathrine still loves him. Though she loves him she is so concided and horrible herself she refuses to be with him. I cannot tell you how horrible each of the characters are in Emily's novel you must read it for yourself. Please don't misunderstand me when I say horrible I mean the behavior and attributes of the characters not that they are poorly written or lacking in depth. Even thought this characters are the complete oppsite of good I found that I wished for their pain to stop. Each of the characters were in such a constant state of torture I could not really blame them for acting the way they did. They say that misery loves company and Emily's novel could not paint a better picture. It does take some adjusting to the way it is written the wording and phrasing are not of this era. But once you get started and get a feel for the writting style you will become consumed by the characters and their pain. I thought this book would be just another one of those old dull reads but it is so much more. I know its old and hard to understand at times but is so worth the read. I didn't think I would finish reading it but my curiosity would allow me to quit. The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters. To love someone can be a beautiful experience but to misuse it like Heathcliff did was horrible and mean. Got this book version along with Romeo & Juliet and Pride and Predjudice for a Secret Santa gift. The covers a pretty and so a la \"Twilight\". Wuthering Heights is the classical novel dealing with undying love and loss. Set on the moors of mid-nineteenth century England it tells the story of a love between the orphan boy Heathcliffe and Katherine. Katherine and Heathcliffe fall madly in love with each other, but there love is not to be as both end up marrying other people. However, their love for each other continues even after their marriages and after their deaths. This is a love that cannot be stopped by death and endures forever.In Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte wrote of one the classic novels of the nineteenth century. Her characters are well done and the story moves along at a pace that draws in the reader and won't let go. The story is told through the eyes of Katherine and Heathcliffe's nanny, Mrs. Dean, as she tells the story to man who has rented out part of Heathcliffe's property. Mrs. Dean's perspective is always humorous and one almost wonders how much of it has been changed to cover over her own role in the events. It is a testimony to her characters that by the end of the book you will end up hating some of the characters. I personally could not stand, Isabell's son Linton - he was whiny, selfish, pain in the a*s and I was routing for Hareton to beat up him up.The only slight problem with this book is it was written in the old style popular during the nineteenth century - at times this makes the reading some what ponderous. In particular, Joseph's dialogue is a labor and in order to understand it I had to almost read it out loud.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful story about two people who love each other so much that nothing can stop their passion. It is a story as old as time and that will endure until the end of time. It is easy to understand why Emily Bront's first (and only) novel was ill-received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill-starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront. Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti-hero Heathcliff - a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights - teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild-spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff's own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few - if any - likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront's exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first-person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff's tormented childhood, Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff's elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar's marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights. While this book has beautiful descriptive language, the story drags on at a snails pace, which is rather uneventful for my tastes. If you have the patience to sit through this book, by all means read this. However, if you feel you need an interesting tale that progresses at a faster pace, you'd best look elsewhere. Real, raw, uncontrollable love. This is the most hauntingly beautiful love story. Tragic and absolutely beautiful, plot is amazing and the writing is beautiful. What a great gift from Amazon! It's so nice to read 'old' books again and this time because I want to and not because it's a school assignement . It's been interesting to discuss with friends how some of our views and perception about the book change with maturity. i was so glad to find this amazing edition for such an affordable price! it was in great condition, exactly as the description said. thanks so much! This is one of my favorite classic books, and had the pleasure of reading it a few years ago. I am happy to have a copy of it on my kindle now to take with me always. This novel is one to be read for the beauty of the writing and the deeply twisted approach to life. To call it enjoyable would do it a disservice, it's provocative and enthralling. Don't read the review from Monika \"equestrienne_23\" below.I have never read this book and was looking at the reviews online to see if I could get an idea of what it was about. Then I read that one review that gave away the whole book. That was quite a dissapointment.IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE STORY IN YOUR REVIEW AT LEAST SAY IN THE TITLE \"CAUTION: SPOILERS\"Not right I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \"Wuthering Heights\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil. THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The love story between Catherine and Heathcliff was largely unimpressive and exceedingly disappointing. I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be. 'A masterpiece' probably sounds like a clich&eacute; for this novel, but that is exactly what it is. From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial. I have a unique image of how I see the story and characters, and that's how it's going to stay.Simply put, everyone should give this book a try, even if they don't like classic novels. It has a thrilling plot, remarkable characters and beautiful language. Condemed when it was first published in 1847, 'Wuthering Heights' stands out today as one of the greatest novels in the English language.Highly recommended! \"Wuthering Heights,\" Emily Bronte's only published novel, is a saga of two Yorkshire families who live in the remote Pennine Hills of England's North Country. To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\"Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \"Wuthering Heights\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \"passionate\" nor intense feelings. \"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he also possesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Bront spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \"Wuthering Heights.\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?JANA When Wuthering Heights first came out, readers were shocked by the violence and the passion of its story, that is the strange romance between the mysterious Heathcliff and Catherine Earnchaw, the daughter of Mr. Earnshaw who adopted Heathcliff. The scandal was so much that Emily Bronte, when she died, thought that her book was a failure. Fortunately for her, and for its first readers, the story's reputation grew among literary circles, became an important reading for people like Virginia Wolf, and even became a movie in 1939, starring the great Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. As such, the book's reputation has now become an important piece of art around the world, influencing important artists in their works (ex:Jane Campion's The Piano, J K Rowling's Harry Potter, etc.)Most people tend to focus solely on the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine and they tend to think that the story is simply a love story, which is what they did with the Laurence Olivier movie. However, Wuthering Heights must be considered, at least that's what I think, as a tragedy which shows how a simple act of kindness from a good man brought forth discord, jealousy and a story of revenge whose victims, the Earnshaw and the Linton families, soon suffer the wrath of someone who never received the most decent sense of love. Not only that, Wuthering Heights shows how certain families, in distant regions positioned far from big cities, act between themselves as they bring upon each other their own laws. Having had grandparents who lived in regions resembling as much as the moors surrounding Wuthering Heights, I wasn't that much surprised by the cruelty that some of the Earnshaw and the Linton brought forth on Heathcliff.So for me, that book, was a pleasure to read again and again.One thing that surprised me with this book is how Emily Bronte managed to transcript the dialects of the countrymen of that region. Indeed, certain character's dialects are written according to how the characters pronounce them. Though reading it straight on for the first time, might be difficult, I suggest to those that may be rebuked by this type of dialogue transcription to read the dialogs aloud. To me it felt much more easier to understand certain conversations and have more pleasure reading that book.As such, I recommend this book to everyone who would be interested to read a great piece of literature or to discover the original material that brought forth the movie adaptations that they love to watch and rewatch. Far too drawn out, poorly written- Not at all engaging or otherwise, this book brings on suicidal tendancies to it's unfortunate readers. The Bronte sisters are known for their works, notoriously boring and wholly uninteresting... Wuthering Heights was slightly reminiscent of a dark, boring soap opera, that made me long for the end of it... Oh my God! This was the most amazing book I have ever read. I cannot express how thrown i was by this classic tale of disturbed love and torturous passion. It knows no bounds!! The most amazing experience for me was to read this book, Cathy is beautiful and ghostly, Heathcliff is dark and still, yet undercurrents of black, storm his character like a great tempest! The relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff could be explained as so: Cathy is Heathcliff's light and Heathcliff is Cathy's eternal darkness, these are two characters who love what they have learned to fear! AMAZING!! So beautiful! The cover art work for this book (and series) are amazing. I enjoy the classics anyways but the beautiful cover makes it so much more of a luxury experience. Don't hesitate to add these books to your collection. This book must be considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. Each character is so unique that I felt drawn into the story. Although one cannot identify easily with these characters, their desires and pain are shown clearly throughout the book and this is part of the reason it is such compelling reading. So compelling, in fact, that I almost couldn't put it down until the heartbreaking, yet very fitting, end. The movie American Beauty reminds me of this book. Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book. It's very rare that this happens and its believable, but in this case it's very believable. It is a dark book, almost a ghost story - the kind of thing that must have inspired our modern-day Anne Rice, minus the fangs. It is also a great illustration of the ultimate dysfunctional relationship: Intense passion and misery; haunted souls. Love can be very powerful, but don't try this at home kids!",

         "First time reading anything by Julia Quinn. Couldn't get enough of the Bridgerton Family. Kept you on your toes and I hope that she continues on with the family. Need a story about their mother.Keep writing...... This was the first Julia Quinn I picked up and it is still my favorite. Daphne Bridgerton is a refreshing and original character in a genre where so many heroines are cookie cutter copies of the archtypical independent Regency lady. Her relationship with Simon Bassett follows the comfortable formula of a Regency romance (he meets her, she is his pal's sister, witty banter occurs, they try to keep their hands off each other, they can't, romance and conflict ensue, conflict is resolved, and they live happily with each other) without being stale. Ms. Quinn's army of secondary characters is as endearing as the principals, and I hope that she plans to continue the story of the Bridgerton family. I have since read her other novels, and the &quot;Duke and I&quot; stands out among Ms. Quinn's other works and of the Regency genre at large. Copyright in 2000. This was a very good book and had me laughing out loud in a few places. The beginning where Simon meets Daphne is actually hilarious. Poor Simon didn't have a very good deal with his father but despite, or because, of this he grew up into a wonderful and compassionate person. Daphne knows what she wants and seems to get it. She seemed to have a great grasp on who Simon is from the beginning and was able to be both serious and lighten things up as needed for him. Simon was still dealing with his childhood trauma and I loved how this wasn't dealt with lightly and how Daphne was able to positively impact things for him. Altogether a fun, and seemingly fast, read. A good start to the Bridgerton series. I look forward to reading the rest of the siblings stories. This was my first Julia Quinn novel and it did not disappoint. I will re- read this book again. It is funny, seductive, romantic and skillfully written. Quinn has a style of writting that brings the characters alive in your mind you can see them in your mines eye!! I liked this book so much I wish someone would make it into a movie! The Duke and I grabbed me from the beginning and kept me up at night. I have read other Julia Quinn books and find her books to be quick reading, if you stay up all night, and gripping with fun, interesting characters. I enjoyed and recommend this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this STORY. I liked the interesting psychological problems Simon had. I liked the the way Daphney understood how to help. Julia Quinn is one of the best historical romance authors I have ever read. This series is great reading. I could not put them down until I read all 8 books. WONDERFUL !!! I liked this book. It was nice to see a female character with both backbone and wit. The story was enjoyable. Defintely recommended. I hesitated to buy this book at first because some of the reviews seemed to suggest that parts of it were really sad, and I generally prefer to read lighthearted stories. However, I am really glad that I read it, because my fear were unfounded. While it is true that the author makes use of childhood emotional abuse and disability to create Simon's character, the tone never became outright depressing or angst-y, though it is highly possible that some readers might react more strongly than others, due to personal experience. In contrast to other period romances I've read, the source of romantic and dramatic tension is not derived from some twist of fate that set the hero and heroine at cross purposes, or some cloak-and-dagger intrigue threatening one or both their lives, but from the psychological barriers that Simon had set up as a coping method for his father's emotional abuse. It might sound a bit cheesy, and in truth this plot device is not exactly innovative, but Ms. Quinn's characterization is so well-executed that it feels very genuine, and not contrived or hackneyed at all.What I find tedious in a lot of period romances is romantic tension being fabricated out of some misunderstanding between the hero and heroine, and getting dragged out over the book as they keep being too stupid to just say what they're thinking. Thankfully, Julia Quinn's leading men and ladies are never that ridiculously pig-headed. The romantic chemistry is credible, and the resulting tension arises naturally as their personalities interact. The interactions between the Bridgerton siblings also feel natural and endearing. Perhaps the only criticism that I would like to make is that sometimes the jocundity between family members gets a bit over-played, and so the humor feels heavy-handed at times. Nevertheless, the atmosphere of the book never becomes flat or cliche. The entire reading experience is very enjoyable, with very polished prose, consistent and engaging characterization, and well-paced plot development. The novel follows one continuous dramatic arc that never feels rushed or dragging, with a very satisfying resolution and happily ever after.This was my first time reading a novel by Ms. Quinn and it has turned me into a big fan. I bought The Viscount Who Loved Me immediately after finishing this book, and will probably finish the entire Bridgerton series. Her plot elements may not be the most original, but they are well-written and a pleasure to read. They do draw from slightly more weighty subject matter than most books in this genre, to create believable and profound dramatic tension, but the reading experience is never emotionally-taxing, and so I would still consider these to be light and enjoyable reading. how embarassed would I have been if caught? Not at all!!! This book had all the misunderstanding and angst I like in a romance novel. Yay Julia! I have been a fan of Julia Quinn's novels for quite some time. I am a sucker for historical romance; there's just something about Regency gentleman and the idea that city-wide scandal that can result from a kiss. It's absolutely fantastic.I love the Bridgerton's. They are a large family, a widowed mother with eight children named alphabetically. They are a really close family and according to society mothers, blessed in the looks department. It's similar to Jane Austen in that society mothers love to get their children marry attractive people with money.I love Daphne and Simon, separately and as a couple. I also love that Quinn started the series by writing from the perspective of the 4th Bridgerton child. Daphne and Simon are both stubborn and tenacious and perfectly suited for each other but they just don't see it. They pretend to be engaged so that they don't have to deal with society mothers trying to get them to marry other people. Naturally, hilarity ensues.It was moving, romantic, heartbreaking, funny...you feel ALL THE THINGS when reading Julia Quinn. Oh, and of course there are sexytimes. You don't get that from Jane Austen. (Though I have heard that there have been some rumblings of people rewriting the classics like Jane Eyre to include sexytimes. Does anyone know if this is true?)Anyway, this is a great read for fans of historical romance. Or those who believe that chivalry isn't dead. I can't wait to finish out the series. I bought this book to pass the time, and I am SO glad I did. This book was hands down; the funniest Regency novel I have ever read! I literally laughed out loud throughout the entire book. The characters were true to form, and nothing seemed forced or unrealistic. I will say that I noticed a couple of typos that someone overlooked but that did not diminish the book. I would have liked to know more about the \"first trio\" of girls, not to give anything away of course. I am looking forward to Anthony's story in the second in this series. Another witty and enjoyable entry from Miss Quinn reminiscent of Georgette Heyer at her best but with sex. The romance of Daphne and Simon is told with humour and filled with fun characters. Miss Quinn manages to produce sparkling conversation and plenty of fun while building a highly enjoyable and light romance. This is the first book of The Bridgerton SeriesI liked the story for the fact that she has loving and over protective brothers. Also, I fell in love with the Bridgerton family. Other than those two, the love story was just an average read for me. This love story didn't have enough spice for me. I think I wanted the hero, Simon, to be more of an alpha male or at least to show more of the characteristics of an alpha male who's in love with Daphne. I would have rated this as two stars if I didn't like the Bridgerton family interactions so much.This book is a \"MUST have\" to add to your romance book collection.The series follows the Bridgerton siblings1st book- \"The Duke and I\" Daphne's story2nd book- \"The Viscount Who Loved Me\" Anthony's story *eldest sibling*3rd book- \"An Offer From A Gentleman\" Benedict's story *my favorite story out of the series*4th book- \"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\" Colin's story *second favorite*5th book- \"To Sir Phillip, With Love\" Eloise's story -haven't read yet-6th book- \"When He Was Wicked\" Francesca's story -haven't read yet-7th book- \"It's In His Kiss\" Hyacinth's story -haven't read yet-8th book- \"On the Way to the Wedding\" Gregory's story *THE LAST of the series* -haven't read yet- Awesome! It was great read. Can't wait to read other books in series. It story line flowed very well and I could not put it down. Julia Quinn is a great writer. She keeps you wanting to read the next chapter. Really enjoy reading her books ,especially the Bridgerton family series. This is my first Julia Quinn novel and definitely definitely not my last. I just loved this book!Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, agree to pretend they are in a courtship in order to avoid the pressure of being flaunted in society as marriage \"material\". They do not count on falling in love with each other, but fall in love they do! The chemistry between these two characters sizzles, their dialogue constantly witty and fun. I love the fact that Simon is not the typical romance hero. Of course he is handsome, arrogant, and a rake. But he also has a weakness which I found completely endearing without detracting from his masculine appeal. The plot is fairly simple which makes it quite believable, but very interesting nonetheless. The secondary characters are excellently portrayed as well and I just cannot wait to go on and read their own stories This was an excellent book - funny and realistic dialog, quirky characters, and a hero who needs love so desperately. I hope Ms. Quinn writes about the other Bridgertons - the other 7 siblings deserve stories of their own, especially Anthony, Benedict and Colin. My heart was ripped out for the poor hero; he had a large problem to overcome just like most romance heros, but his was one of the best to read about. This was great! This book is absolutely wonderful. I'd heard good things but honestly, it was brilliant. The best part of this book was the glittering humour. Often romances can be stupid because they just aren't funny- this book had laugh out loud moments.The secondary characters are fabulous- I loved Colin, Anthony and Benedict. The hero was fabulous. Hot, clever and flawed! After suffering from a speech impediment he really hates himself and the heroine, Daphne is the only one who can pull him out of his shell.Daphne is like a breath of fresh air. She's sensible and pretty and clever.My one criticism would be that not a lot happened, but ah, how enjoyable that not a lot was! The first installment of the Bridgerton series focuses on the eldest Bridgerton sister, Daphne. This is an emotional joy ride in how Simon Bassett, the Duke of Hastings found true love with Daphne Bridgerton. Simon grew up motherless, rejected by his father, and with a speech impediment to boot --he stutters. He overcame this impediment but it still comes out especially in times of great emotional strain.Simon met Daphne when he rescued her from an obssessed suitor. The Duke just came back from living abroad and found out that Mamas with marriageable daughters kept hounding him; whereas Daphne needed to raise her marriage desirability among the eligible bachelors of the ton. So they struck a deal, they will announce a sham engagement. Of course, once the proposals started pouring in for Daphne, Simon thought that the sham engagement must be turned into a real one. And before anyone could say \"Duke of Hastings,\" they were married.Daphne found bliss and happiness in Simon's arms, and wants to start a family; but Simon's painful childhood is blocking the way to their total happiness.\"The Duke and I\" started off lighthearted but it has moments where you truly feel for the characters. I like Daphne's strength and her determination to pull Simon out of the dark remembrance of his past. Firstly, this is not a clean Regency. Disclaimer aside, this is ranking as one of my top 5 Regency Romance novels read so far. This book was positively amazing. From the witty dialogue to the heart-rendering plot, this book has it all. The Hero is fantastic and I fell instantly in love with him when he punched Novel's lights out at the beginning. The heroine was so wonderful that I wish I could actually meet her. Of course then I would want to steal her Hero so maybe not. The sex in this book is incredible. It is hot but sweet and fitting. The author weaves it into the story seamlessly. There is more than one love scene so delicate readers beware, but again it is all tastefully executed. I also loved the brothers and the mother of the heroine. Too bad Colin is a brunette. Had he been gifted with raven hair he would have stolen the book. &lt;wink> Highly recommended for all discerning Regency Romance lovers. Apparently the author chose the pseudonym Julia Quinn so that her books were beside Amanda Quick's on the shelves and more people might buy them. Amanda Quick is, of course, hugely successful in this genre but I believe Julia Quinn is a much better author - and this book is a good example of that. If you want complete accuracy in historical detail then this is perhaps not the best author for you - her characters speak with American turns of phrase and rather more 20th century than 19th century worldviews in some cases, but this is common to so many Regencies it's almost de rigueur now - if you can read it as fiction and not history you'll be fine.\"The Duke And I\" is the first of the Bridgerton series, focusing on daughter Daphne, and it's a good Regency Romance like many out there (there are also, of course, countless dreadful Regency Romances in print too!) However, like \"The Viscount Who Loved Me\", the second book in this series, Julia Quinn's characters have a lot more depth than you often see in modern books of this genre.Yes, we have the usual requirements - balls, gowns, the marriage mart and all the rest of it - but this series delves more closely into family dynamics and character growth. Daphne is the fourth child and the first girl of the Bridgerton family; her father died some time ago and her mother has brought up all eight children in a strong atmosphere of love. This was by no means usual at this time amongst the aristocracy - nannies and nursemaids often functioned more as parent figures than the actual parents - and it has enabled Julia Quinn to build a foundation of strong ties between brothers and sisters that she uses in the books.And this is the contrast between Daphne, the heroine, and Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings, the hero. His upbringing was completely different - his father rejected him, thinking he was stupid because he stammered, and Simon vowed to avoid marriage and children to get back at his father - the direct line of the Dukes of Hastings would die with Simon. But when he meets Daphne and they discover that a sham betrothal would be of benefit to both of them, their plans start going awry.What's so good about this book is the way in which the characters begin to understand each other. Daphne learns to stand on her own two feet away from her family - particularly her brothers - and Simon learns to deal with the dreadful legacy that his father has given him. This book often deals with strong emotions and I, for one, think Daphne's behaviour at one particular point is unforgiveable, but I suppose it's this warts-and-all portrayal of two people trying to come to terms with sharing their lives together that is so powerful about the story. A definite keeper. Made me laugh out loud. The characters' wit and personality shone. Wonderful. You must get it. This book is a tale of 2 people with an attraction towards each other. A girl who wants to get married and have a family, and an experienced male who very certainly does NOT want to get married. They kiss, get caught, and the man is faced with a choice between death via duel and marriage. And this man chooses death. The woman, of course, talks some sense into him and they get married. He beds her but refuses to orgasm in her, then he leaves her in his childhood home and travels abroad while she decides to return to her family in shame. I must mention, the first half of the book was wonderful with lots of amusing dialogue. It was just the second half of the book was not so good. Personally I didn't think that a forced marriage and a husband who refuses to orgasm within his wife to be all that romantic.This book was shockingly similar to Love Only Once by Johanna Lindsey, right down to the protective older brothers, tryst in a garden, abandonment, family shame, and unusual circumstances of pregnancy. Thus, I will give it a similarly poor review. If you like reluctant and bitter romances, then enjoy this book. If not, save your money. The Duke and I is Julia Quinn's best book to date! All of the humor and witty repartee that are Julia Quinn trademarks are present in the Duke and I. Not only are Simon and Daphne wonderfully drawn characters, but so is the supporting cast of the Bridgerton family and Lady Danbury who leave you smiling and laughing throughout the book! LOL! I was given this book by a friend, and found it delightful. The main character is spunky and fun, the writing is excellent, and the story is good. It did indeed make me read the whole series. This is the first book I have read by Quinn and I have enjoyed it immensely. It had been recommended by a friend and now it's my turn to do the recommending. Despite a few heavier scenes, I would call this a fairly lighthearted romance filled with fun and laughter. Don't get me wrong though. The heavier scenes kept the story from being too fluffy or shallow. In fact, I would say it rounded the whole thing off quite nicely. The Whistledown reporter was a delightful addition and I was left wondering who exactly she was. I look forward to the next Quinn book to see if we actually do find out her identity. I especially enjoyed the scenes where Simon joined the family for dinner and later an outing to Greenwich. Simon was a wonderful hero; strong, handsome, great sense of humor, and his one &quot;inadequacy&quot; was endearing, although HE might not think so. Daphne was a terrific heroine. Charming, witty, and if not wise in the world, wise in matters of the heart. But, for me, of course it was Hyacinth that stole the show. I don't know why, I do not keep Ms. Quinn's books, I love reading them and have read everyone she has written. &quot;The Duke and I,&quot; has humor, and it is a very easy read. This book has a little mystery and makes you think as you read. The characters are well developed as a matter of fact you can just about picture them as you read. Simon's speech problem was handled in a very realsitic way that made you feel sympathy and pride for how Simon accomplished this. I really like the inperfect characters. Daphne's ignorance added humor, which I liked and gave the story line a interesting twist. I know there will be sequels to this book, because the brothers were so well developed. I am very happy that Ms. Quinn writes so fast and we will not have to wait years to read the other books. it was an ok story, a little uunbelivable, but i would read more of julie quinns books, i did like bridgerton family Quinn's book is in a word - dull. The story line is not horrible, albeit somewhat trite. It was the characters, however, that got to me. They are in every sense two-dimensional, flat characters that prevent the book from becoming more than a dreamy, hastily thought out fantasy. There is no conflict of emotions whatsoever, and hence, no depth. And if the lack of originality and good plot weren't enough to put anyone to sleep, her diction fully drives the point home.I've read fanfiction by 13 year-olds much better in every way than this. What a wonderful young writer Julia Quinn is. The words are fresh and so enchanting. You believe the love and hardships both Simon and Daphne experience and you are there with them every step of the way.And I just adore the Bridgerton family. The most endearing family ever to grace the pages of any romance novel. I can't wait until Julia Quinn writes each and every one of their tales of love and mischief. And, pay close attention dear ladies, the Dashing Bridgerton brothers are especially inviting! It's so charming the way Ms. Quinn describes the love and protection the brothers give their young sister Daphne: always watching after her and making sure that no ill will comes her way (although occassionally they're a bit too overprotective, but it just makes one love and esteen them even more).And I loved Lady Whistledown and her hilarious gossip column.Ms. Quinn will now join my list of most treasured authors based on this book alone. Her eloquent writing is one of the best I've seen; I don't know if this will be the case in \"The Viscount Who Loved Me\" (the second installment of the Bridgerton family) or \"An Offer from a Gentleman\" (the third installment), or any other future readings of Julia Quinn, but I am most eager to find out!I definitely-and wholeheartedly-recommend this book to anyone in need of escape from the drudgery of life to a world filled with romance, comedy, and a whole lot of fun. Happy reading... While the book had the usual characters needed for a romance novel, the writer made them all very real and there were a few little twist. There is one segment that had me laughing out loud and I think that is hard to do in written form. I expect to read more from this author. Reading The Duke and I got me started reading all of the other Julia Quinn books. They are all as great as her newest title. I loved all of them. Julia is an extremely funny writer who is a joy to read. Her characters are bright, funny, articulate and a lot of fun to follow.All of the characters in The Duke and I are a lot of fun. We have the usual rakes just waiting to be reformed and properly married off. We also have the society maiden, sparkling and full of fun, but not quite ready to be drawn into the expectation of society. The character which comes as a bit of a surprise is the main heroine's mama, Violet. Her family and friends see her as nothing more than fluff. Her children adore her, but avoid her. What they are missing is that she leads her family just the way she wants them to be led without anybody being the wiser. The hero is also a bit of a surprise with a disability which has not been covered very often (or as effectively) in the romance world.Read The Duke and I. It's a lot of fun. Then check out Ms. Quinn's other books. If you like Jude Deveraux, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Amanda Quick, you will like Julia Quinn. I promise. This title was a first for me by this author, but it won't be the last. It was sensual without being too steamy. I loved Daphne and her boisterous family, but especially Simon. I think you will too. This was a great beginning to the series! I am obsessed with this series and to start off with this book was GREAT. The characters are so much fun to get to know, and the love story keeps you hanging on. Great book! :) I loved it! Will be getting more by this author for sure!! :) I want the next one in the series for sure. I really enjoyed this book. I purchased the book on Saturday and finished it on Sunday. Chores were ignored as I read on and on. I have a love / hate relationship with books like this, I love the book but hate that it is over within a matter of days. Looking forward to her next book!",

         "Little Women",
         "The heartwarming story Little Women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters growing up in New England in the 1800's during the Civil War. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel. Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas and dreams of painting in Paris. Alcott portrays the characters that make them come to life as you read and the thrill you have that lures you into reading more and more. This book leads you to realize what family love is. I so love the adventures of these four sisters and laughed and cried almond with them! I may read it again! This is a really good book. It can get kind of slow at times and it's very long but definitely a good read. Its a good history, easy to read and enjoying each page.Good for the Autor and for Amazon that make possible read it. I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five. While I still love the covers for the penguin classics series and I enjoyed \"Little Women\" as a story, after having read \"Tess of the Durbervilles\" and enjoying the incredible footnoting, I was a little disappointed with the footnotes for \"Little Women.\" This was always one of my favorite stories. I'm very glad that I now have it in a more portable fashion. Little Women is a cherished book of the ages. I loved it when I was young... and I still love it as an adult. An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a diaryof their lives, until three of them get married and have babiesof their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:) I usually only read Action/Adventure, so when my friend request that I read this book I just stared at her with a blank expression.I started reading and I could not get through the sentences fast enough. I laughed and I cried.This truly is a great read! Please make it shorter and not to have so many confusing plots in it. But it was still a little bit good. Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens. I'm so glad I bought it anyway. I found the characters so endearing and the story so full of emotion that this became one of my favorite books. I'm not sure many guys I know would care for it, but I can't imagine a female of any age not loving it. A must for the young reader! Any girl who has a sister will absolutely love reading this classic book. I loved it and my granddaughters love it. Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \"boy next door.\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up. I love classic books and they are free and easy to download. I love having them immediately at my fingertips with just the touch of a button. I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days. This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women. I finally read Little Women when I wa 23. When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \"cool\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant. This is one of my favorite books at all times. I laughed, sobbed, and smiled along with all the March girls. It was such a sweet and innocent novel and helped me understand the passage of time. This book just makes me smile! Perfect for light reading. You won' t regret getting this cute book. Read it, you' 'll love it. Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \"Little Women\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \"Little Women\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \"poor little rich boy\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \"Little Women.\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \"scribbling\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \"Little Women\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \"heartwarming\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \"perfect little homemaker\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\"Little Women\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement. This timeless story of four young sisters growing up in Civil War-era New England is the sort you can re-read over and over, picking up new details every time...Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March may face serious troubles, such as poverty and concern over their father, off fighting in the war; but no matter what, their unique personalities still result in endless daily squabbles and laughs...especially when their rich but shy and isolated young neighbor Laurie gets involved.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \"Little Men\" and \"Jo's Boys,\" which continue the sisters' stories as they mature and begin their own families. I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.The movie, however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good. Somehow I'd never read this book before-only seen the movie-but it's truly an excellent book, well written,many life lessons still applicable today. Great read for boys/men and girls/women. read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have. I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street. My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \"Vanity Fair,\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \"heaven,\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \"potboilers\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \"boy\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\" I have just re-read \"Little Women\" and found it even more intriguing then the first time I read it as a preteen. As I enter my 40s, I am thoroughly enjoying reading the books that kept me enthralled endless nights. I hope that the person who left the bad review does not give up on the \"classics\", and that they will find one that sticks with them forever. There really are some that follow a more predictable path and have that happy ending s/he is looking for. I plan on introducing this edition to my soon to be eight year old as she explores the new world of reading. I've always owned a copy of Little Women ever since I first read it at aged 9 (which means I've gone through numerous copies over the past decades!) This particular edition is sturdy, attractive and exactly what I needed to replace my last falling-apart copy. Since I read this book every year, I expect this copy will see me through at least another few decades! i wold not buy this book if i were you.(dont buy this book) This book took me awhile to read and some parts I didnt quite understand. But it is one of my favorites. I love all the characters, espcially Joe. I love the time it's in and the story its self. All I have to say is WOW! An American classic. What's not to like? This is a tale of love, life, childhood... it is easy to see why this is a classic. The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \"contemporary\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true. This book was a bland romance book.I am twelve year old boy so dont get be wrong that i read love books.Theonly reason i had to read this book was because my mom made me read it for homeschooling.I would no recomend this book for boys.Girls may be wild about this book but i think the book was crappy.But i gave little men a very good read.You can read it if you type in little men.Go to second page and its the first book on the top.Please read it. It was a book about four young ladies. I would read it if you liked somewhat sad books and somewhat romantic. The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women. I first heard about this book while watching an episode of Friends. The minute I started reading it, I fell completely in love with the characters. It was a very heart-warming story that I would definitely read again. I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N; discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (\"Aunt March Settles the Question\"). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \"home copy\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect! Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again This is one of the greatest works of American fiction ever written. It touches my heart in a different way each time I read it, and I have read it several times-every Christmas since I was 12. I've been looking to replace my worn, cheap, but dearly loved copy with something with a classic cover to mirror the classic literature its binding holds. This \"Deluxe Edition\" is a disgusting display of...I don't know what. The cover has nothing to do with the story. Cartoon scribbles of girls with pimples? Not only is this unappealing, it also implies that what lies on the inside is inconsequential dribble which it most certainly is not.Buy this book, just not this edition. I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to. I am a sixteen year old girl and have just finished reading &#34;Little Women&#34; for the upteenth time. Let me say, once again I loved it!! Every girl should read it and have a copy in her library......A must read!! As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there. The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story. Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \"Home Sweet Home\". This is a classic we wanted our grand daughter to read. The illustrations are professional and wonderful THIS STORY BROUGHT BACK FOND MEMORIES OF SITTING NEXT TO MY GRANDMOTHER WHILE SHE READ THIS BOOK TO ME AS A LITTLE GIRL. I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it. I bought a Kindle because it's easier to read, and when I discovered I could get it free on Kindle, hey, it was a no-brainer. I'm trying to build up a library on my Kindle of the classics I never had time to read in high school or before, although this was not one of them. Haven't read the free Kindle version yet but I will. Am thoroughly familiar with the story and looking forward to reading it again. Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read.In this novel about faith and courage, four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, fight through the hardships and beauty of life.While their father is off to war, the sisters give up their daily bread to keep their courage alive. The words are so crowded. So I won't suggest this one. This book is one of the best books I've read. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone even if you love to read or if you don't. Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy. Thanks for the fast delivery and the great quality. I would do business again and would recommend friends or anyone for that matter to do business with you. Have read Little Women many times in my life...it is my &#34;go to&#34; book on my Kindle when I want something familiar, something that I find comfort in as I read the familiar tale with the characters I have come to know and love. This has been my favorite book since I was 10 and it still is 30 years later! I was so giddy they had it on Kindle and it was the correct version! I read it every single year in November and my copy that I have had this whole time shows the wear and tear so that pretty much says I believe you will fall in love with each character and laugh and cry with them and, at least for myself, want to be Jo. It's a classic! How can you not fall in love with the characters every time you read it! Jo is my favorite! I read this every winter. It's my favorite book ever. Her sentences are breathtaking and every character is charming. I feel like I've learned something at the end of the book. I found this book very &#34;comfortable&#34;. I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book. I read Little Women when I was a young girl, and now I am a grandma, but I must say, this wonderful book for young girls is a must read. Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!... I found Little Women okay, but a bit boring at times. There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying) This book is timeless- beautifully written, interesting, and with themes that transcend generations. I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers). i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on. I can't wait to see the Movie I hear it is great hands down this is the best book!!!!!!!.....:) I had read this book several times growing up and loved it. Thought I would give it a try again now that I'm older and I still love it!! This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites! This book ought to be read by students in countries where they are not asked to read this. It's sad,funny and a wonderful story Where did you get this edition of Little women? It was filled with grammatical errors. Reading your book really was a bizarre experience. Have one of you editors read this edition. How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting. I bought this book as a gift to impress the receiver. To my shock, the receiver told me the book was very nice indeed but it contained only the first half of the book. I did not see anywhere where we are told about this being only half of the book unless you include the Library Journal description. i loved this book soooooo much. i read it 5 times. it still never gets old. i first read it when i was 7. now im 12. istill recomend it to everyone who asks me for a book idea. i give it 5 stars",

         "Reading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them (P.S.)",
         "This book seems to be aimed primarily at creative writers but it will give prolonged satisfaction and pleasure to all lovers of literature as the many excerpts are the strength of the book, and they are chosen from an appealingly wide range, including authors presented in translation. The effect is either to introduce you to exciting authors that you do not know or to have your already good opinion confirmed in interesting ways. None of us has time to read everything and this is an excellent way of planning your future reading, as well as learning about writing technique. However, I do find the writer's tone occasionally a little too enthusiastic! Since Ms. Prose is a teacher of writing, and this book purports to be a tool to improve others' writing, it's inexcusable for it to contain errors in punctuation, usage and translation; in addition, some of her examples of to-be-emulated writing are overly subjective and overly long. I noted 92 outright errors and questionable examples and might have found more if I hadn't got so bored that I skipped 20+ pages.As a memoir, this book is reasonably enjoyable. It's not an informative writing guide. One of the functions of a critic is to slow us down.Readers flipping the pages of a Derek Armstrong orTK Kenyon novel may be propelled by the plot to readquickly: chew it all up and swallow and move on.The aptly named Francine Prose invites us to take a breath.By focusing our attention on some wonderfully wrought writing,she encourages us to see how that stuff is built, to go behindthe curtain and watch the wiz at work.Some of the examples that she explores may seem odd toone reader or another, but I found her discussion of onepassage that I didn't admire to be as stimulating asthe rest.Reading Like a Writer was recommended to me by MartinDonoff of Fairleigh Dickenson's MFA program in writing.It's used as a text in that program.For the writer, this is a reminder that the best writersread and that what they read is the best writers. Thisbook is an inspiring tour that will lead the reader toa higher level of pleasure and the writer to a new levelof the craft. Read this in small doses and let it staywith you.(Incidentally, the author photo is pretty hot too.)--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe novel bang BANG. ISBN 9781601640005 I enjoyed reading Harold Bloom's 'How to Read and Why', and Nabokov's 'Lectures on Literature', finding them to be interesting and useful, and so looked forward to Francine Prose offering fresh insights on reading and writing.On my first reading the most important insight for me was her emphasis on subtext which - although a familiar term - never really became assimilated into my reading, or writing for that matter. As an habitually fast reader I would have been implicitly aware of much of the subtext as part of my enjoyment of a book, but probably retained little that was explicit and easy to recall.Reading 'Reading Like a Writer' for the first time has encouraged me to become more aware of subtext, not only in reading, but also in my day to day conversations: Practicing awareness of subtext - mentally making it explicit in what I say, and in what the other person says - hoping that, as in all of our endeavors, 'what we practice is what we become'.And so,I look forward to further readings of 'Reading Like a Writer'. I am sure I will find other useful insights with further rereading. This is no ordinary book. When I first tried to read it, I found it slow and dry. It was part textbook and part anthology of excerpts. Some time later, I started again, took my time and let myself savor each example, each point. I got swept up the author's love of books - her appreciation of the craft of writing and the her wonder at the infinitely varied and beautiful results.In short, this is a mind-expanding tour of literature. It gave me a much deeper appreciation for both reading and writing than I'd ever had before. Starting with word choice and then moving to sentences, paragraphs, dialogue. I couldn't wait to read more - and to try my hand at writing.This book inspired me to explore works from authors I hadn't known - like Heinrich von Kleist and Paul Bowles - as well as lesser known works from authors I'd read before such as Virginia Woolf's \"On Being Ill.\" I was even inspired to read again the works of Hemingway and Philip Roth that I thought I knew well but, this time, I would read with different sensibilities.If you love books - whether or not you wish to write - you will love this delicious literary buffet. It will change how you read and forever enhance the experience. I both read and write for both fun and profit. This slowly-read (the author says to, and she's so very right!) is well-written about good writing and equally as enlightening, good reading.And how about a writer named Prose writing on writing! Kismet!Enjoyable and accessible for every literate person.Wannabe's too. I recommend it for any reader or writer.(Now I'm going back to check out her book BLUE ANGELat, where else? Amazon, of course.) In addition to having been a librarian for more than three decades, I also have been a freelance, self-employed developmental editor and copyeditor for nearly as long. I've earned a useful supplemental income reading manuscripts, both fiction and nonfiction, and making well-considered suggestions not about plot and character development -- that's the job of the author's agent and the publisher -- but about word choice, sentence structure, and chapter organization. (\"`Anybody' jars the flow here; try `anyone', which has one less syllable. And make this a one-sentence paragraph to emphasize your point.\") Of course, I've also been a heavy reader all my life, since even before I started school. After I began reading like an editor, though, I found myself unconsciously thinking about the words the author had chosen in whatever narrative I was currently engaged in. Francine Prose (what a felicitous name for an author!) is an advocate, practically an apostle, of the practice of \"close reading.\" Modern critics tend to concentrate on an author's biography, political beliefs, and other not very relevant matters rather than examining the beauty (or not) of the writing itself, the language the author determines to use. Prose developed her approach to this by teaching literature and writing classes -- something a great many published writers do, between the appearance of their first couple of novels (by which they establish their credibility) and reaching the exalted heights of multiple best-seller-dom (if they ever do).She begins at the atomic level, with words, which are to writing what notes are to music. Using examples as dissimilar as Flannery O'Connor and Herman Melville, she works her way step by step through a piece of prose, showing how careful word choice can promote a paragraph from good to perfect. Writing is the product of thousands of these small decisions. Then she considers the sentence in the same fashion, and then the paragraph. In the matter of narration, the author argues that who is telling the story is less important than who is hearing it, and under what circumstances. It may be easier to tell a tale to a secret listener, even if that person never appears in the story. Some famous novels (those by Dostoevsky come to mind) feature characters who explicitly reel off their whole life stories to strangers, though modern readers would find this incredible in real life. The chapter on character is a bit weak compared to what came before, with Prose giving lengthy examples from Austen, Eliot, Flaubert, and Heinrich von Kleist (whom I confess I've never read), but never really getting into the theory behind character development. Then she goes on to the problem of dialogue, which young writers are told ought not to resemble conversation in real life, with all its hesitations and stammers, nor should it be made to substitute for exposition. Still, she points out, if one eavesdrops in a coffee shop, one finds that most conversation serves multiple social and psychological purposes, and a fictional narrative can certainly make good use of such multitasking. And what isn't said can be as important as what is. But well-handled dialogue can also be one of the most effective ways of taking the reader inside the head of the characters, delineating their purposes and motives, and advancing the plot generally. The principal examples she gives in this chapter are from the works of Henry Green, a genuine master of revealing dialogue. Then comes a chapter on what Prose calls the \"details.\" Is God really in them? Properly sketched and plausible details in a story are what convince the reader that the narrator is telling the truth. (Police investigators understand this, too.) But what does one do about the plethora of detail with which Kafka describes Gregor Samsa? And sometimes the detail is what you most remember about a story, like the slice of watermelon or the bloody potato in Chekhov. Again, it may be an effect of my editorial activities, but I always notice the \"telling details\" in a story. Prose's final section deals with gesture -- which I would not have identified as one of the major considerations in writing a novel, at the same level as character and dialogue. In fact, I would expect gesture to be more important in film than on the printed page. She makes a good argument for avoiding what she calls \"generic\" gestures, with interesting examples from Kafka, Joyce, and Henry James, though I think I would have included all this in the chapter on detail. Finally, there are two chapters of more general authorial observation and advice in which Prose insists that budding young writers read the stories of Chekhov, and then sums up the reasons why you can't be a writer without being a reader. It's an interesting volume, and certainly well worth reading, though it has the feel of a series of separate lectures or conversations simply brought together between two covers. I majored in English and had my fill of reading from the great masters followed by some lecturing, which is what this book is. Yet I love to read and want to be a writer. So this book should be for me. Right?Sort of. There are lots and lots of excerpts. While some of the discussion was helpful, I ended up skimming most of the book and looking for Prose's main points. I did find quite a few tips that I'm going to keep in mind in my own writing, especially those on gesture and dialogue, and I am going to check out a few short stories and books that Prose mentions that sound intriguing.I checked this one out at the library and I recommend you do the same. Francine Prose, in \"Reading Like a Writer,\" argues that creative writing cannot be taught in a classroom. A workshop may provide valuable encouragement and support for a fledgling writer, and a good instructor may show a novice how to edit his work more effectively. However, a writer learns his craft by reading and rereading the books, novels, plays, and short stories of great writers, and he improves his skills through practice. Prose recommends studying \"meter with Ovid, plot construction with Homer, comedy with Aristophanes.\" She backs up her thesis by giving a host of examples from writers she admires, such as Austen, Hemingway, Joyce, Chekhov, and others who are a bit more obscure.Prose discusses the basics, including the use of the exact word, sentence building, paragraphing, point of view, character, and dialogue. Close reading, she asserts, enables us to understand not only what the writer is stating, but also what he is implying. The subtext is often as important, if not more important, than the text itself. Throughout \"Reading Like a Writer\" are excerpts, some brief, some lengthy, from a variety of sources, followed by Prose's witty, insightful, and informative commentary. Why does the writer choose one particular word or phrase rather than another? How do the seemingly minor details and gestures in a scene sometimes convey more information than the characters' statements?\"Reading Like a Writer\" is not a handbook or a manual. It is a love letter to the mysterious alchemy, the magic that occurs when a reader encounters a book, poem, or story that not only entertains him, but also moves and transforms him. Francine Prose's favorite writers may not be our favorites, but all readers who love literature will appreciate her enthusiasm and respect for the written word. Her suggestions about how to read more effectively are useful not just for budding writers but for anyone who would like to come away from a book with a deeper appreciation of the author's craft. As Prose says, \"Reading this way requires a certain amount of stamina, concentration, and patience.\"\" The reward for all of this effort lies in \"the excitement of approaching, as nearly as you can hope to come, the hand and mind of the artist.\" I was drawn to purchase this book by a review in the New York Times. This review was very convincing. I am a writing instructor working with non-writers who need to be able to write, whether willingly or not. I thought I might be able to use this book in class or at least mine it for ideas. While this work would be a good model for anyone writing papers for graduate school literature courses, I don't think it lives up to the promise in the title. I did not get a clear sense of her audience either. I felt talked down to, and I'm just a teacher [itallics on that] of writers. The main assumption of the book is that for you to be a \"better\" reader or writer, you really have to read word by word whatever the author wrote; something akin to tasting wine or improving your taste buds with a different kind of sushi. From word by word, the author goes to sentence to sentence; and then (obviously) to paragraphs. Though I am an avid reader and was familiar with some of the texts/writers the author mentions in this book, I have never in my life read any text for pleasure like this (word by word?). Grading papers, yes; but not reading for pleasure, I insist. Probably this is a good book on what the final book should look like, and not on the writing processes that go through the writer's mind while doing his job, and certainly not what goes through the reader's mind either (if not interested in writing a classical book).Still, the texts/paragraphs the author works on are interesting by themselves, and made me interested in getting to read some of them. I go back to this book frequently for not just information, but inspiration. The first chapters are particularly useful for anyone who writes. The work pulls you back to the basic idea of the words. Sure, we all agonize over POV, but Prose lets you see that what truly makes a difference are the words.Another good feature is the book list at the end. I carry it with me when I go to used book stores and the library. When I'm tired of the new stuff, these classics Prose uses as examples inspire me. This book sounded like a natural fit for me... Reading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them by Francine Prose. I read prolifically, I write... Perfect, right? Nope. Guess I'll never be a writer based on this book...Contents: Close Reading; Words; Sentences; Paragraphs; Narration; Character; Dialogue; Details; Gesture; Learning from Chekhov; Reading for Courage; Books to Be Read Immediately; AcknowledgementsI had to think a bit to figure out why this book didn't do much for me. Prose talks about how slow reading and deconstructing of the masters can lead one to become a better writer. By noting what works and what doesn't in terms of words, sentences, dialog and such, you can tap into the collected wisdom of the ages when it comes to putting words to paper. That's all true, and I know that I *do* read much too fast to savor the way the construction of a story occurs. Where I lost it however, was with the lofty ramblings about how one word was used instead of another, how a particular sentence said far more than the words contained, and how the mind of the writer was dissected along with each word. I'm sure the greats probably did agonize over each page and paragraph. But if I read a book in her style, I'd spend hours getting through each chapter, and the joy of reading would disappear entirely.I think the other part of my disconnect was that my writing tends to be nonfiction. Nearly all her examples deal with fiction and stories, and I know that's a completely different beast when it comes to writing. I've often said that if I wrote a novel, it'd end up being about 50 pages long as I don't do color well. As stories are all about color (stated or implied), I don't relate to her commentary when it comes to my own work. Yes, I *do* need to spend more time thinking about how writers construct their words. I just can't fathom doing it at the level she presents.If you're seriously into writing fiction and have a more introspective nature than I do, you will probably get a whole lot more value from the time you spend with Prose. I guess for me, I'll just have to stick to my doomed efforts to communicate with a reader... I strongly recommend this book.As a writer of creative fiction who dreams of being published, a familiar knot formed in my stomach when I read the opening sentence of Francine Prose's Reading Like a Writer. \"CAN CREATIVE WRITING BE TAUGHT?\" Just like that, in all caps, this question which opens the book will surely taunt the angst of aspiring authors and leave them, like me, holding their breath, waiting for the answer.Whether you are one of those who love books or one who wants to write the books that become beloved, I strongly recommend this book. Although I am not going to reveal Ms. Prose's answer (only because I think you should read the book yourself!), I will say that this book rejuvenated my excitement for reading and was further inspiration for my writing.In this book, it is as if Francine Prose is your own personal literature professor, standing at the front of the classroom of your mind and giving you permission, encouraging you even, to immerse yourself in the pleasure of books. For this reader, such \"permission\" was a breathe of fresh air (you mean reading is supposed to be enjoyed?) and the guidance Francine Prose offers rubs away detritus accumulated from college lit courses that were conducted more in the spirit of an anatomy lab and reading groups/mainstream media that peddle the notion (which many of us buy) that she who reads the most, the fastest, earns the Superior IQ medal of honor. By the time I finished the book, I was nearly salivating at the thought of alternately devouring and savoring the books Ms. Prose recommends at the end...just - for - the - fun - of - it!As for the book being helpful for writers, I can only speak for myself and am somewhat reticent because, as the saying goes, \"the proof is in the pudding.\" That being said, Ms. Prose does a superb job of navigating the area between prescribing formulaic dogma for creative writing (of course that's an oxymoron, but that doesn't stop many others from teaching it anyway!) and revealing such delicious insights into the art and practice of writing that I have most of the book dog-eared and underlined, awaiting my return. And I will, again and again. This New York Times best-seller came well-recommended by a friend who teaches (and has published) teen fiction-writing in a local University.The author's breadth of knowledge of novel writing and her ability to grasp and portray elements that model great authorship makes this a must-read. Also an excellent aid to intelligent readership. Felicitously named, Francine Prose has written the book nobody else dared to--a work for writers analyzing in precise terms what the great ones do with words. There's no theory here, no post-this or neo-Marxist that, just a delicious savoring of the goods from many canonical writers (Flaubert, Austen, Stendahl) and just as many contemporary novelists I'd never heard of until I picked up Prose. As a college English instructor, I've assigned stories by Truman Capote which I have my classes read almost literally word-for-word, analyzing how the least choice of noun, verb or adjective enhances our understanding of the characters and their motivation. Seeing Prose do the same with dozens of brilliant works, I'm heartened that the gourmand approach to literary criticism is far from dead, and that long after the trendiest -isms have been laid to rest, every child has at least been accounted for, and the quantitative, time-management model of reading has scorched its last cylinder, people will still be poring over great writing, marveling at the exquisite choices plucked by the masters over many others. This much-needed book will improve your writing and enrich your life. I really enjoyed Reading Like A Writer and since my son enjoys learning tips from authors, I gave this book to him after reading it.A great gift item for those who want to, or think they would like to, write a book! I'm sorry, but this book is incredibly dry. I can't seem to finish it no matter how hard I try. Don't buy it if you have short attention span. I'm only 60 pages into the paperback version, which I just bought a few days ago....and I can't wait to finish it, just so I can go re-read all the classics that I feared, like Moby Dick. Ironically I recently got half way through Moby Dick, and stopped out of boredom, and was just tired of reading the meandering plot. Upon completing Prose's book, I will return to Moby Dick, or perhaps start it all over again.It's like Francine Prose just showed me the \"DaVinci Code\" for books! I always wanted to read all of Charles Dickens's books, but kept putting it off, and think I've only read one my whole life, and I'm 56 years old.Books are very important to me, and Francine's book just gave me a new lease on life! If you have been exposed to Literary Criticism or Creative Writing, you probably dash for the bar or the loo when a practitioner comes within range. Here, though, is one you can stick around for. Perversely for her type, Ms. Prose loves literature--yes, really loves it. Also, as Barbara Tuchman might say, her writing lacks the modern virtue of incomprehensibility.Her method fits into no discernable school, structure, dialetic, or theory. Instead, she selects a hundred or so excerpts from her forty or fifty favorite authors (an unremarkable list; you will know almost all of them), and follows each excerpt with a lucid discourse on why it is great. This is teaching by example, suffusion by osmosis, and she is a master of the technique.Among her heresies: clarity is a high virtue; writing is very hard work; craft counts more than class or ethnicity; within reason, conventions of grammar and style matter (Strunk and White's \"Elements of Style\" as a fiction writer's resource? Is she kidding? No.) Above all, great writers slave over EVERY word, so we should read accordingly, that is, SLOWLY. Heresy again.Ms. Prose has a lot in common with William Zinsser, author of \"Writing to Learn\" and \"On Writing Well\". On the nonfiction side, James B. Stewart's \"Follow the Story\" belongs in their company. I hope they all know each other. They sparkle in an otherwise dismal field. You really have to think about what the author is saying and how she is looking at the pieces she uses for illustration, but it is very interesting and thought provoking to consider that writers do make choices that communicate a subtext and a depth to their composition. I'm enjoying the learning process.",

         "Ms. Ephron's voice stands out as one of the clearest, wisest, and funniest in the world of personal essay. This insightful (does she ever write anything that's NOT insightful?) collection of essays entertains while poking fun and chipping away at the process of growing older in a youth oriented world. Read this and weep, and laugh, and weep, and laugh. Go NORA. I admire Ephron but could not help wondering, in the few minutes it took to read, why this was published as a book when it seemed more a witty article. Women over sixty are already clued in to her insights,i hope. Its appallingly short. I loved this book. I'm 44 and feel the years creeping up at an alarming rate. This book helped me realize that the years ARE creeping up and I'm not alone. This book showed me the humor and inevitable nature of aging and yet reminds us to seize the moment. That is something you can never be reminded of too many times. I cannot believe this book was published. The author comes off as a shallow idiot who actually expects readers to enjoy/sympathize with/relate to her writing about her vapid life. She has nothing new to say and doesn't say anything well. She whines about getting old. She's also cushioned against many of the problems of the elderly due to her wealth. Since this book was a complete waste of my time, the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it's short. After reading this book I knew I had found a kindred spirit. Great timely observations and good for a LOL experience. This book will resonate with any woman over 40. It contains truths both amusing and painful that are so familiar. Nora Ephron finds the words to intimately describe the mystery of the pocketbook, the vaguries of coloring your hair and the deep sadness of losing a friend. This and \"A Year of Magical Thinking\" by Joan Didion are two books I don't want to ever be without. Oh my God .. every woman - no matter the age - should read this book. I wish I had read it in my 20's or 30's and am afraid too much damage by 60! Gave it to both my 30 something daughters and told them to pay attention. I wasn't thrilled that the author read it - a bit too deadpan but soon realized that no one else could have done it justice. I loved it! Nora Ephron's Book is both hysterically funny and full of everyday wisdom about the aging process from the perspective of a woman. As a man I personally admire all women since they constantly do their very best to look the very best while being able to perform all the day-`to-day duties at home or at work, and complaining a lot less than we men do. I bought this book as gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it. The author's reflections on the little and big things a modern woman faces to keep looking at her best are simply put funny and true. The stand-up comedy language and the format of the book, which is divided in short stories or essays makes this book really entertaining.I am usually surrounded by graceful women, ....hey, of course I am talking about my wife and her two lovely sisters (really I get along very well with both). I guess that as any other woman in this planet they are always worrying about their age and since they approached the forties all the three begun subtracting years from their age every birthday so I believe they all will be younger than they daughters in a few years (at least according to their accounts). That being said all the three absolutely enjoyed the book, so much that I am planning to buy an extra copy for my mother in law. This is the perfect gift for a \"woman of a certain age\"... I got it for my older sister's birthday but read it myself before sending it. I'm buying many more turtlenecks these days. I love Nora Ephron. While I am in my 40s, I am keenly aware of the aging process, and it was refreshing to get a chuckle out of the subject. Nora writes from the heart, with wit and wisdom. She captures the concerns of many of us gals and makes you feel like you're not alone with your thoughts. A worthwhile read. I love this book, she had me in tears I was laughing so hard. How sad Nora Ephron has passed she was a witty and joyful author and will be missed! Quick and easy read. Entertaining and insightful of how we feel but haven't put our thoughts into book form. Nora did for us. I'm a big fan of Nora Ephron's films, but haven't read any of her books until now. I wasn't surprised that I found her style so engaging. She is a master of writing simply yet with incredible depth at the same time. Perhaps I've been trained by her films to want a lot of witty lines, zingers so to speak, and was a bit disappointed that my mind sometimes wandered when reading. This definitely wasn't a page-turner, but I found her honesty and insights delightful. I'll probably pick this back up again in ten years when my neck really starts sagging! I have given this book as a gift more than once and it has had every woman laughing out loud and fuming at the accuracies. Nora Ephron has that knack of hitting the jugular with her verbal scalpel, leaving only attractive scars. Laughter lines are the only visible damage, this is a book worth swallowing your ego and pomposity to get through. Don't read it on a train or bus, other women will start examining your crow's feet and doubt your sanity when they see the title. It is a perfect gift for either a great friend or, better still, a great enemy; they'll never know which way to take it. Sisterhood in camouflage ! ! I ordered this book, advertised as NEW, and, unfortunately, did not open or check it until yesterday. There are two spots on opening pages and in the upper right hand corner is printed, in pencil, Jane J. There is also faint spotting on the last two pages. I need to give this book as a gift tomorrow and I am greatly disturbed at my findings. It was a serendipitous happening that this request for report arrived when it did. Too bad I didn't check the book upon receipt. Now I have to decide whether to give a damaged gift on time, or wait for a replacemment and be late with my gift.I am unhappy about this.Diana Parham I can't remember the last time I laughed so much while reading a book. She teaches us not to take ourselves and life so seriously. I love the way she thinks! She's oriented me to a new way of looking at everyday mondane activities in our lives. There's so much humor and laughter in what we do! Add Nora Ephron to our list of turtleneck icons - Katherine Hepburn and Diane Keaton. Katherine knew what she was doing. Rarely did we catch a glimpse of her neck. And Diane made us all proud in \"Something's Gotta Give\", looking fabulous in all her mock turtles - even when she told Jack to \"cut it off\". Nora has hit the nail on the head with this one - from our feelings about purses (and I'm not sure the manufacturers aren't somewhat to blame for our hatred of them - I often picture purse designers howling with glee as they mis-locate inner pockets or leave them out entirely - or put in so many that we walk around the house looking for items to fill them up) to hairstyle frustrations (what does one do with smooth, silky hair that overnight becomes stiff and bristley or starts to grow in the most unlikely places?). I felt I was reading my own journal most of the time. She lost me when she delved into the agony and ecstacy of New York apartment ownership and rent controls - but, what the heck, it's good for us ruralites to hear about the the trials of city living. I loved this book - it's short and a quick read - and the perfect aging girlfriend gift. Okay, Nora - now, please write another \"When Hally Met Sally\", \"Sleepless in Seattle\" or \"You've Got Mail\". Meg Ryan is starting to wear turtlenecks, so time's a'wastin'! Wow, could I ever identify with much of what Ephron wrote in this book. Her essays on aging were so on-target...I kept thinking \"I could have said this\". But the thing is, I could not say it in such wry, lively, entertaining prose. Ephron excels at this kind of writing, poking fun at herself and at the world in which she lives. She shows us that a bit of humor and learning from our past goes a long way toward making life easier and fuller.I loved what she had to say about maintenance, her purse, and losing friends. I only wish the book had been longer...more essays. maybe there will be a sequel?!?!So much of this rang true that I went out and bought several copies for friends. It is the perfect gift! This book was whiny and condescending - I stll don't know if she's still married or not because she only talks about herself and her silly cooking problems (get a life!). She can't blow dry her own hair? How absurd is that? Alright already with New York - we get it - you love it. The last chapter of this book depressed me so much - I just turned 60 and it made me feel like there's no reason to go on. I wonder why the mood of the book changed so much in that last chapter. The book was all fluff and no meaningful in the least. it's hard to feel sorry for someone who can pay $10,000 for an apartment if she wanted to. I felt like she was trying to sound like someone out of the bohemian '60's, naming specialty stores around her and dropping names of people constantly. I wish I could get my money back. I didn't even like her silly movies. And what does \"don't marry anyone you wouldn't want to be divorced from\" mean anyway? Ephron has some good and funny stuff in there, but I felt like I was always waiting for the climax. It's a collection of stories about her life (which are supposed to ultimately show her thoughts on getting older), but there's no cohesion amongst them and I finished most of the stories thinking \"Um, okay, that was random... Why do I care?\" She never seemed to take the stories as far as she should have. They could have been really great, hilarious anecdotes, but because of the way they were told, I was left less than amused. I usually like Nora Ephron's work and this was up to her standards in terms of high quality of writing but I guess I am either not quite old enough (and I am 52) or I am aging differently because I found little to identifiy with in the essays. I read them, and felt I should enjoy them, but her world seemed far removed -too cosmopolitan perhaps(read New York)--for me to find gems of truth for myself. On the other hand, my sister says she has real issues with her neck and would I please send her the book right away! Oh, I enjoyed this book. I had to find a quiet corner to read this book because I kept giggling and smiling to myself. When I found myself laughing out loud at the candid humour of the lines, I knew I had to hide somewhere where no one could see me laughing to myself. Ah, it's so true - how we ladies would slog in front of the mirror sometimes just to feel confident stepping out of the house. I would recommend this book to my friends who are fifty and above. Not what I expected after hearing her interview on the tube. Could only relate to a few of her stories and found the others quite shallow. I found this quick read a winner!! Lots of belly laughs and subleties as well.........quite witty and certainly 'hit home' with women of all persuasions! It is now being passed around my circle of female friends and by the time it 'comes back', I'll be ready for another go with it! As we say in Instant Messaging, LOL~!! What I loved most about this book is how I envisioned the \"events' in my mind; the scenarios I would create to soften...no, negate the adverse effects of the blow. In each instance, I imagined I was with friends whom I had grown old(er) with, not the young hard-body that I'd deluded myself into believing could relate to my inner-struggle and tumult.I had the pleasure recently of allowing a great pitch (based on a book by Kenneth Bucchi) to slip through my fingers as I pondered far too long its implications on society -- something I would not have done ten years ago, mind you. That careful deliberation, however, was the impetus for my asking, \"So, what else ya got?\" What landed in my e-mail box five minutes later (yesterday, in fact) was a treatment dealing with this book's very subject matter...albeit an empowering, high-concept, wish-fulfillment version. It literally had me laughing out loud at those ten (audible throat clearing) years younger who would scoff at such a pitch. Thank you, Protocol Entertainment for the treatment and Nora Ephron for this book! Maybe it's just me, but I expected so much more from this book. I thought it would be wittier, more original, and use humor to inspire middle aged women like me. Instead I found it to be a negative read and it just brought me down. Sorry, no recommendation from me on this one. Fun to read, my friend told me about this book & she was right. Buy it & you will find out. Bought this for a short business trip. It is somewhat amusing and I identified with most of it. Especially, the purses and moisturizers. My purse barely passes the security inspection, so that part was very funny to me. Being a professional, I have to carry a laptop with my files and my 'handbag' for an overnight.Most of the book is dedicated to growing older gracefully. Nothing too earthshattering. Just an amusing little book to wile away a flight to Atlanta. I have enjoyed most of her movies which made me smile a little. No little task in my profession of abuse evaluation. Sometimes, you need to focus on the silly things in life to get a balance. This helped to a degree. This has to be the funniest book that I have read. The reality is so true. I just wish the book was longer in length. I am passing this on to my sisters. This book kept me smiling from start to finish.I had not even realized the extent of things women all do in common when it comes to aging. I loved it. Some very funny moments. Sometimes hard to identify with author although I, too, feel bad about my neck. I guess not the type of book I need to read now. I think it is a satire on the vanities of women's world. If you think you are a woman who is getting old, read this book. You will laugh and you will certainly identify with the author's observations and statements. I did not expect this book to be what it is. I bought it because Nora Ephron had authored it. You can finish it in one sitting of maximum two hours. You will not learn anything new. I gave it five stars because of the way Ephron has treated the subject matter. You will laugh reading about the mustache, Jolen bleach, threading, and the truthful necks. The last sections of the book reminded me of \"integrity versus despair\" of Erikson's final stage in psychosocial development. Ephron asserts that when in mid sixties, there is gloom all around-friends dying , friends battling with illness ; you are forced to conclude, no matter how successful your life was, it has been full of disappointments and mistakes. I am not sure if each one of us would have this conclusion. There is no doubt that you will be conducting a review of your life but what would you exactly conclude? I think it is going to vary from woman to woman. I think Nora Ephron could write about the telephone book and make it entertaining (one brief section in this book about parenting proves the point). Here's an example. Most writers don't want to think about aging. If they do, they want to prescribe \"solutions.\" Nora Ephron has a different idea: Simply describe aging as something we foolishly try to stave off (pretty unsuccessfully) by sharing her own experiences.That concept is best captured by her essay \"On Maintenance\" that describes in detail the time, money, and effort she puts into trying to look as good as she can. I'm reminded of a conversation I had with my cousin (who in her more naive days was a beauty queen) who always looks terrific. When I complimented my cousin on her appearance once, she replied, \"You have no idea how much more effort it takes every year.\" Now, I do!The essay \"I Feel Bad About My Neck\" is very funny. I don't think I ever look at women's necks . . . but now I know that some women do. Apparently it's all downhill after 43. The essay ends with the irony that Ms. Ephron cannot do anything about her neck without a facelift, and she's not a good candidate for a facelift.I also liked her essays about how we fall in love with concepts, places, and people . . . for no particularly good reason. But that temporary embrace is soon replaced by another one that will probably be even more satisfying. Although not described that way, you get a sense that she views her prior two marriages much in the same way. This concept is beautifully explored in \"Serial Monogamy: A Memoir\" (about her affection for various cookbook authors), \"Moving On\" (about her 10 year delight in a large apartment in New York), \"The Lost Strudel\" (her desire to recreate happy experiences through food that's no longer easy to find), and \"Me and Bill: The End of Love\" (about her feelings about Bill Clinton as a leader).Some of her essays border on being rants. I found those the least appealing. These include \"I Hate My Purse\" and \"Blind as a Bat.\"Vignettes are powerfully shared. I loved her humorous take on probably being the only White House intern JFK didn't make a pass at and her expert explanation about why typing was irrelevant as an intern in the JFK White House in \"Me and JFK: Now It Can Be Told.\" She also does vignettes brilliantly in \"The Story of My Life in 3,500 Words or Less.\"She ends with thoughts about dying, and humor fails her. But \"Considering the Alternative\" is the section where you see the real woman most clearly.Writers will love her mother's advice: \"Everything is copy.\" The older I get, the more I realize that's true.Those who like to fall asleep with a smile will find it makes sense to read one essay a night before turning off the light. Sorry - I only read this book because I had nothing better to do. Nora seems to me to be a spoiled, precious New Yorker whose wit is whiny. Can't compare to real humorists like the late, great Erma Bombeck. This book is wonderful! I'm in my early twenties and this book had me laughing, crying and everything in between! I loved it so much I bought it for my mom and my mother-in-law! It is wonderful for women of all ages! This book started out very funny and then crashed. I finished reading it because it was the selection for my book club. After having the misfortune of watching her execrable cinematic retake on \"Bewitched\" last year, I thought Nora Ephron was moving toward a lost cause when it came to writing comedy of any relevance to me. Fortunately, at the age of 65, she has decided to try some honest introspection and has come up with an alternately hilarious and poignant collection of essays about aging not so gracefully. Even though her target audience appears to be women of her generation, I found myself surprisingly enthralled by her piercing wit and emotional candor about growing old.It's a shrewdly observant book in which she begins by talking about how aging becomes most pronounced in the neck. Ephron goes on to discuss all the medications and sundry items that have become part of the mandatory inventory in a woman's purse. With each subsequent essay, the book delves deeper into a stream of consciousness about the obsession over looking young from hair coloring to botox and even a lengthy and sadly unrequited love affair she has had with her rent-control apartment. Who wouldn't be similarly besotted in the financial maelstrom that is Manhattan? Ephron can even laugh at her years of psychoanalysis, which she has concluded after so many dollars expended, has been a waste. It's not all about the humor, however, as the author takes a hard look at her own mortality through the endless line of deaths among her family and friends.At the same time, there is also a feeling of hope and a touch of whimsy in her late-blooming romance and eventual marriage to writer Nicholas Pileggi. Anyone who has read Ephron's roman-a-clef, \"Heartburn\" (or seen the subsequent 1986 movie version with Meryl Streep) knows how deserving Ephron is of this level of domestic fulfillment. Even though her cynicism can get a bit overbearing, the book is ultimately a revealing look at a sharp woman intent on opening a Pandora's Box about the horrors, both perceived and real, about closing in on death. This is an excellent book. Reading this book let's you laugh at your own age and it's ups and downs. Nora Ephron has the ability to make you realize your not alone in this world as a woman. Love it and highly recommend this book. This book was so precious, I gave it as gifts to two other friends. I also expect to use it in a journal writing workshop. Ms. Ephron is such a delightful person and an amazing writer so plan on not putting this book down before you finish it. Even then you beg for more.If you've ever lived in Manhattan or ever want to, this is the book to read about how exciting life can be in the city. Ms. Ephron puts you right inside her apartment with her remarkable descriptions of the rooms, hallways, courtyard and of course the corner green grocer. You feel like you are a neighbor listening in on others' conversations. You're looking through the peep hole along with Ms. Ephron watching the bicycle get moved.Any woman over 40 will delight in reading about all the things we focus on that are indicental to who we truly are - a beautiful species.You'll want to give this book away to all your female friends and share in the laughter and wisdom that comes from reading it.By time you finish the book, you will have fallen in love with yourself all over again.I want more of Ms. Ephron's books to read. Trying to finish this book was painful. I did not find it funny or delightful and any of the other terms used to sell this book. I received it as a Christmas gift and felt it was my duty to read it. Usually I will read anything; however, I have drawn the line at a book written by an author who does nothing but stroke her own ego and try to convince her aging self that she is/was someone the rest of us want to be. Don't waste your money buying at the full price. I'm sure there will be plenty in your choice of paperback or hardback at the used bookstores/yard sales soon. Mine will be one of them. I don't feel about my neck. It is of no consequence to me yet. But everything else Nora talked about in the book, I can truly relate to. Especially the purse. I am trying to find more and more ways not to have to carry a purse and when I do I carry a backpack type purse. Even that drives me crazy.It was a great book and I would recommend it to any woman. I also read several passages to my husband, who could also relate because of me. Fortuna mailed me a check for the 53 cents postage due-- a pleasant surprise! They are a business with integrity. Hilarious book that every woman over 45 should read or give to friend, sister, mother, etc. I loved it. Very short, easy reading but sooooo funny. Reading this book is like a slumber party with all your best girlfriends. Pass the chocolate chip cookies and enjoy some girl time! Nora Ephron's latest book is a must read for women over fifty. It makes us laugh at ourselves, and even cry a little, at what us boomers have in common. The end result is a wonderful feeling that we are OK as we are, and we're all in the same boat. At least we have necks to feel bad about !! I loved, loved, loved this! My book has been read several times not just for the uplifting stories, hilarious anecdotes and stories but also because I have cooked from some of the recipes. This is a book which makes you a wiser, happier person but also a better cook. A life-enhancing book from a brilliant and very funny woman. A great read and present for all those you love! I was disappointed. First couple of pages okay then I just didn't think it was that witty. Was expecting more. Some of it was boring. Expected more. Light and forgetable. Nora Ephron is used to making the best out of a bad situation, most notably in her book \"Crazy Salad,\" where she skewered her ex-husband and had a best-seller to boot. But no amount of wit and intelligence can overcome the facts of aging, disease and death that we all have to face as we grow older.Ephron writes slight, humorous essays here about her aging body, the curse of designer handbags and parenthood along with some autobiographical reminiscences. She makes interesting observations about how hair dye has transformed the lives of older women. The end of the book falls a little flat, when she writes about her mother's death and the death of a close friend. Her writing needed to shift gears and get more serious. What's left when her humor fails her? We need to see more of Ephron's non-funny emotional self.Ephron knows that she writes from a position of privilege--she's affluent, happily married and not marginalized professionally the way so many women are in their middle age. Personally, if I had a house in the Hamptons and an East Side co-op, I could easily live with a saggy neck and a messy handbag. I hope Ephron uses her wealth and celebrity to help women whose lives are less fortunate than hers. Nora hasn't written that much for the page since Hollywood whisked her away. And that's sad, because she is a warm, winning essayist with her own unique voice. Her tone with is us is friendly and intimate -- she's sharing it all with us, sisters. Everything from facial hair to men to motherhood to money. Sometiems she wants us to empathize with her, sometimes she wants us to learn from her experiences. It's all very funny. I was only sorry it's such a slender volume. Okay, I know this is chic lit, which generally is just a lot of fun but not a lot of substance, but even so I was dissapointed. Where was the fun? Most of the little diddies in this book were rehash that just weren't that good to begin with. Trite is the best word I can come up with to describe it. Chic lit does not have to be bad, there is some very feel good entertaining reading for women that is better, like 'Enchanted' by Nancy Madore, 'This is not Chick Lit' by Elizabeth Merrick, and The Guy I'm Not Dating by Trish Perry. After reading some of the \"critical\" reviews, I feel compelled to add my own review. First of all, I absolutely loved this book. I have recommended it to many friends, and I usually describe it as \"chick humor\". While, yes, I am young (just 40!), I feel I can read this book again in 5-10 years and get something totally different from it! I think this book is fun, and yes, lightweight. I DON'T feel this book was intended as a guide or, as one reviewer put it, a list of complaints about aging. Observations is what I'd call it!So, if you are a woman looking for a light, fun (and funny!)book, you should consider picking this one up! Oh (pause) My (longer pause) Goodness (sigh). Nora Ephron is a wonderful writer who should never be permitted to read aloud, let alone be recorded doing so. She has horrible reading voice - it's very dull which, I am guessing, is why she chooses to Over Emphasize Every Single Word In The Book as though each word was followed by and exclamation mark! My usual enjoyment of her writing forced me to listen to this through chapter three and then I just found myself teetering between wanting to fall asleep or simply scream at her Exclamation! Point! Style! Of! Reading! That accompanied by her dull, yes Du u uu uu ull!!!! tone made this audio book impossible to finish. Sorry Nora, next time you make an audio book, ask Meg Ryan to record it for you. These are Nora's amusing observations about daily life, recollections, and reflections. It was perfect as an AUDIOBOOK to listen to as I cooked, cleaned, and drove. She talks about things women do to maintain their bodies. She talks about living in New York, favorite foods, her love of reading, some thoughts on JFK and Bill Clinton, and more. Several times I burst into a laugh. She's smart and witty. It is rare that a writer gets me to laugh out loud. For that she gets 5 stars.The only negative was that Nora Ephron narrated her own book. She paused a lot in her speech. For example: I went (pause) to the store (pause) to buy milk. The content was so good that I was willing to look past the speaking style. Someone must have mentioned this because when she narrated the sequel she didn't pause as much - which was good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 3 hrs and 53 mins. Narrator: Nora Ephron. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Setting: current day and earlier mostly New York City, NY. Copyright: 2006. Genre: amusing personal essays. I liked this book from start to finish. It is a fairly quick read but filled with an unusual tongue-in-cheek style of wit and humour. After all, we cannot change the aging process, so why not come to terms and make the best of it. I, too, am approaching that big 60 year and as I was reading this book, kept saying to myself, \"Yep, that's me!\" The book will win the hearts of female readers, especially those who are going through or already beyond the menopausal years. You are bound to find a part of yourself in here somewhere. Growing older may bring a few wrinkles and a lot of things that once worked now leak, creak and squeak, but life is only what you make it. The author has a way of making you feel that growing old is not all that bad after all. You can't recapture youth, but you can get more than a few laughs from this book - go for it!",

         "My grown daughter bought this for me as a Christmas present. I think she took a moment to care about what was really a present to me! I love books!The hardcover design is extraordinary. I'd seriously like to applaud the person that designed that! So subtle. So evocative of the story.One of my best presents ever! An extraordinary cover design in hardcover with a silken bookmark which helps with the awesome footnotes! I'm such an English Major geek!Of course I read the book first nearly 40 yrs ago. And have re-read it many times since.Guess it is an acquired taste. ;) Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel. Pleasantly of course. This cautionary tale of sensuality, excess, vanity, and self-love is slow-going for today's readers, used to a brisker pace of writing. The story is wonderful but could have been told in far fewer words; however, word count excess wasn't important in the era in which Wilde wrote and lived his own unique brand of literature, art, and life.Wonderful witty, sarcastic and caustic writing of course, all being Wilde's trademarks. Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. great book hard to read because print was so small I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a true classic. Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them. The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills. However, towards the middle of the book, the plots descends into a lengthy tiring description of artifacts (musical instruments, stones and jewelry, portraits and so on) that really break the rhythm of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was quite fed up with this inventory of objects. The book ends with a moral, which I found to be quite void and meaningless, as I did not accept the book's premise - That all sins and corruption will manifest in one's physical image. This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \"lavishly illustrated\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \"annotations\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \"reader's\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources. I heartily recommend this edition for readers seeking a scholarly edition for research purposes. I frankly cannot see how it can be superseded.\"A very generous endorsement, but for those who are seeking a scholarly edition, you will only find it in the original hardback. Hell can be fun! A book choc-full of bon mots and little phrases to use in everyday life. Wilde was genius personified. Carry this with you always. Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \"youth\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking. This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better. All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\" \"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces. Book is in great condition and received it quickly. The only CON is the book was really small. If the description said it was a gift book size, then it is my fault for missing it in the description. I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' The story of Dorian Gray is one that everyone knows, yet knowing what the premise, and most likely how the story ends doesn't detract from this amazing read. This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\", or \"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like. This is a book that should be in class rooms more often. A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot. Makes you think a bit about life, but was entertaining, and a neat mystery. Read great on my iPhone Kindle app and on my Kindle 4. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The picture of Dorian Gray may have been shocking for its taboo innuendoes when it was first published late in the 19th century, but to a modern reader, almost seeking out an element of that shameful pleasure a well written novel of vanity and desire might evoke, such a thrill-seeker will be a bit disappointed here. That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. I READ IT IN HIGHSCHOOL AND JUST REREAD IT AND NOW THAT SOMEONE DID NOT MAKE ME READ IT I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH MORE loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Will someone please tell me why this \"uplifting classics\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \"cover\"? I find that rather offensive... The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again. Dorian Gray deserved to die a lonely, bitter man. What fascinates me about his story is the way in which he was hammered on by Lord Henry and yet found no room for the good influence of others. Fascinating tale. Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion. The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. It was a gift for my daughter. She was very pleased with the item and would recommend ordering from here again. Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. I would imagine that there is not a very large chance you would findthis book in the waiting room of any plastic surgeon's office. Anexample of a story that suggests be careful of what you wish for. Ayoung man makes a deal to keep himself young and youthful looking.Unfortunately there is a secret associated with this that is hard tohide. The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as. The characters found in the book, from Dorian to the unimportant drug dealers in the alley - they just make you engage in the plot of the story.everyone should read this book - it's a gem. I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a book that truly makes you think about the possibilities of reality. Along with the supernatural qualities, the novel dives into the realm of society and hints to us that we should really think about who we surround ourselves with. It's difficult to know the purpose of this edition of Wilde's novella. I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling. Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. This is an APOLOGIA (I suppose) to Oscar Wilde on behalf of all those who rated his wonderful book lowly. It just so happens to be my favorate book, and I looked so see if there was anyone who didn't like it. Quite horrified, and rather losing my faith in Humanity (or HUMANITAD) I thought: I must write an essay myself!To be honest, I am sure that dear old Oscar would not have been terribly upset some people didn't like his book, for his works are, let's be honest, only truly understood by those who share something of his divine temprement (like me!).Let me now say why I like it.I first read the picture when I was at school (vague memories of having written a review for this book before, have I?) - and, quite honestly, it is the most beautiful and cleverset thing in the world (bookwise).Heaens above, if you can't enjoy a book that is so obviously about pleasure (in a very Epicurean, spiritual way, ye moral detractors, mark you!), what are you doing engaging in the Epicurean pleasure of reading at all? Give up! You do not have a soul to be corrupted! This book will keep you reading until you reach the end. I also makes you think about how the things that you do May impact on others and on your oneself. The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \"dandy\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can. This is one of the best books I have ever read. The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read. Oscar Wilde truly had a way with words. The flow of the book is like poetry. Whilst some may claim the characters lack depth I would argue that one doesn't read a book like this for the depth of characters or plot; It's more about feelings, descriptions and passions. The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow. Provides a gruesome tale of vanity and egoism, a great choice for a book report. Although the entire book is solid, the dialog in the first chapter should be required reading. Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross. Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate. I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.The Picture of Dorian Gray I did not enjoy this story. I really really wanted to. I tried very hard but in the end I was just plain bored. When I realized I was wasting my time I moved on. The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself. I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent! Oscar Wilde makes for an enjoyable read with his incessant and undeniable penchant for dry and cutting wit. He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde. As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls. With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too! Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading. Dorian Gray is not a kid book by any stretch of the imagination. No swordfights, no prince and princess, no happy ending. Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera. Save Dorian Gray for later. A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable.",

         "Julia Thomas finds her life spinning out of control after the death of her husband, Richard. Julia turns to her minister for comfort when she finds herself falling for him with a passion that is forbidden by the church. Heath Sparks is a man of God who is busy taking care of his quadriplegic wife who was seriously injured in a sever car accident. In an innocent effort to reach out to a lonely member of his church, Heath finds himself as the man and not the minister as Heath and Julia surrender their bodies to each other and face the wrath of God. Julia finds herself in over her head as she faces a deadly disease, the loss of her home and whispers about her wicked affair. Julia leaves the states offering her body as a living sacrifice in hopes of finding a cure while her heart remains thousands of miles away hoping to one day reunite with the man who holds it hostage.Whispers of the Wicked Saints is a once in a lifetime romance that is breath taking, defying all the rules of romance and bending the laws of love. Veronica Haddon Fiction",
         "Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week. I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !! This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable. I read the review directly under mine and I have to say I laughed. How can someone write a honest review on a book they read only three pages of? That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it.",

         "Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is \"Interesting!\" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty. It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne This is the way to get a handle on the incredibly complex yet useful theory of Dramatica and its program. At one time I almost went crazy trying to figure out how to use it with my writing and finally gave up, until I found this book. Armando is a genius.",

         "This collection brings together a distinguished group of researchers to examine the power relations which are played out in university law schools as a result of the different pressures exerted upon them by a range of different 'stakeholders'. From students to governments, from lawyers to universities, a host of institutions and actors believe that law schools should take account of a vast number of (often conflicting) considerations when teaching their students, designing curricula, carrying out research and so on. How do law schools deal with these pressures? What should their response be to the 'stakeholders' who urge them to follow agendas emanating from outside the law school itself? To what extent should some of these agendas play a greater role in the thinking of law schools? Fiona Cownie Law",

         "\"Beginner's Yoruba\" is now available with two accompanying audio CDs. It provides an introduction to the Yoruba language, which is spoken by over 30 million people in south-western Nigeria, parts of the Benin Republic, and Togo, as well as in the diaspora populations of Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti. The 15 lessons are designed for both classroom use and self-study. Practice dialogues, combined with grammatical explanations, aid the student in understanding the basics of the language. Each lesson also contains a vocabulary section that highlights the important aspects of its featured topic. The audio CDs, which complement the lessons, help the student easily master the language's unique tones and vowel sounds, often considered the most difficult aspect of the language to learn. Quizzes and practice exercises are integrated into the lessons to help reinforce the material. The book also includes information on various aspects of Yoruba culture, including religion, songs, and folklore. Kayode J. Fakinlede Foreign Language Study",
         "This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.",

         "I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a \"good day\". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the \"I know\" , \"Nice try\" and \"I love you too much to argue\". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!! Jim Fay is the master of removing parents (as the reason) for bad decisions that kids make. He makes the process of parenting simple and effective. The sooner you start this approach with your children, the more you'll love being a parent.

Mature. Joann Sfar Comics & Graphic Novels",
         "I passed over The Rabbi's Cat repeatedly in the graphic novel section of my bookstore... the cover was a bit of a turn-off and the size is a bit cumbersome. I finally flipped through it at my library and checked it out. I'm beating myself up now for not reading this sooner! What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics. This was a book club selection and, at first, I thought it was simply a comic book. Wrong. This is a charming, thought provoking little book that can be read at many different levels. No wonder my rabbi was the one who suggested that we read this. If you understand the basics of Judiasm, you'll get more out of this book. But even if you are not, you will be charmed by this fanciful tale. Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels. I found it interesting but still prefer when reading a novel to have my own ideas of the people and surroundings. Guess that why after reading a novel I am not impressed with going to a movie with hollywood interruptations. The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.",

         "Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.

But this year the battle went wrong as Darak's brother became possessed by the spirit of the Holly. To free him, Darak must undertake a quest to restore the very balance of nature. Barbara Campbell Fiction",
         "The tribe of the Oak has suffered tremendous losses due to plague but they still intend to observe the midwinter ritual where the Oak-Lord and the Holly-lord battle. Oak defeats Holly so that spring will arrive. Darak the hunter is not looking forward to this ritual because his beloved brother Tinnean will become Tree-Brother, apprenticed to the Tree father and will owe his allegiance to his master instead of his family.When it is time to travel to the dimension where the First Forrest lives, Darak refuses to join them and witness the loss of the brother who will be part of yet separate from the tribe. Something goes wrong at the ritual and the Oak and Tinnean disappear. Tinnean's body is inhabited by the Holly-Lord while the Oak and Darak's brother are in the land of Chaos, put there by the spirit of Morgoth, the evil Tree-Father, who held the position before Strauth killed him. Darak and his allies prepare to do battle to bring Tinnean back into his body and finish the rite so spring will return.Think Jean Auel and Judith Tarr and readers will have some idea what HEARTWOOD is all about. The setting feels prehistoric with magic an everyday occurrence. Darak is a strong stubborn man who loves deeply and wants to keep those he cares about close to him safe; when his brother is in danger he is willing sacrifices himself to free his sibling from the enemy. Barbara Campbell creates characters readers will care about and produces a storyline that grabs reader interest.Harriet Klausner After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read. The best fantasy writers not only invite us to explore the magical, but guide us along the way with credible, world-building skills and sympathetic, recognizable characters that engage our imagination, but never tax our belief. Such is the case with Barbara Campbell's HEARTWOOD.I read this book over the course of a weekend in spring but for all I knew, I was not sitting in my backyard with the drone of cars and leaf-blowers and other modern \"conveniences\" competing for my attention. Instead, I was transported to the land of the Oak-Lord and the Holly-Lord where a Midwinter battle determined the advent of spring or the curse of a world locked in the frozen grip of winter.And it is \"heart\" that is the key word in this novel. While the fantastic descriptions will delight and frighten, the characters, from the troubled hero, Darak, to the wise, but aging Tree-Father,Struath, to the sadistic villain Morgath --all-- are \"known\" to us on some level. And that, in my opinion, is this author's greatest gift. Even the god Trickster, cunning, conceited and unpredictable as he is, reminds us of the times we wonder if our Maker doesn't have an unusual sense of humor.If you want to experience a seemingly lost world where the changing seasons are greeted with hope, awe and wonder versus large appliance sales, read HEARTWOOD. I can't wait for Ms. Campbell's next book.",

         "8.0",
         "Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries. Thomas Paine History",
         "This is an excellent collection of the evident, palpable reasons for self-rule, written for the common folk of the time in an inspiring style. Now more than ever we need to revisit the foundations of self-rule and individual rights. Freedom is not easy; it is hard. Freedom is not safe; it is dangerous. RS It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country. This is virtually the ultimate collection on Thomas Paine, the daring revoloutionary in his own right. I have been familar with his writings particularly 'Common Sense' and the 'Rights of Man' and various pamphlets but I had not read his controversial, for the time, \"The Age of Reason'. I had a rebirth in my interest in Paine when listening to Clay Jenkinson discuss Paine during the \"The Thomas Jefferson Hour\". Jenkinson described Paine as a great patriot with his enlightening arguments in 'Common Sense' while 'The Age of Reason' was described as very daring, costing him many of his supporters, for questioning religion. In reason, Paine speakes as deist, believing in a supreme being yet a being that does not intervene in human life or alter the laws of nature. It's an intellectual argument that raises fascinating questions, particularly for the time although Deism had a relatively significant following in parts of the western world. This is a great respource on the writings of Paine, a great book to pull off the shelf and read a particular article. Thus, this compilation provides you pretty much the complete writings of Thomas Paine, certianly the essential Thomas Paine, in a handsome single volume. Thomas Paine was one of our founding fathers, was a \"true child of the Enlightenment\" and believed in the primacy of reason. Through his writings, especially \"Common Sense,\" and \"The American Crisis\" (\"these are the times that try men's souls,\") he became the \"voice\" of the American Revolution.He was a brilliant writer who appealed to a mass audience and was far ahead of his time. Carl Sagan tells us that he \"courageously opposed monarchy, aristocracy, racism, slavery, superstition and sexism when all of these constituted the conventional wisdom.\"In \"The Rights of Man\" he defended the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution against the conservative Edmund Burke.He turned his attention to religion in the \"Age of Reason\" and it remains his most controversial work. While he does briefly discuss Islam (which he calls the \"Turkish\" church), the book is mainly a long polemic against Judeo-Christianity and, especially, a critique of the \"holy\" books of those religions viz. The Old Testament, The New Testament and the Epistles of St. Paul. It is a tour de force and deserves an honored place in the library of those who believe that all the religions of man are human inventions, all are part of human evolution, and none of them have any supernatural content whatsoever.It is better to read Paine in his own words so here, for your edification, are a few \"Gems from the Age of Reason.\" Unfortunately it is only possible to scratch the surface in this short review.Old Testament - \"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more half the bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God.\"Books of Moses -\"The five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are spurious and Moses is not the author of them. Still further, they were not written in the time of Moses, not till several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived; and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of Moses; as men now write histories that heppened, or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago.\"New Testament - \"The presumption is that the books called the evangelists and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and that they are impositions. The disordered state of the history of these four books, the silence of one book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the productions of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called the apostles are supposed to have done.\"Jesus Christ - \"Had it been the object or intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his lifetime. But there is no publication extant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New Testament were written after his death. . . . These books do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes about him. It appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it is only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering questions. . . .From this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years. Where he lived or how he employed himself during this period,is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not apear that he had any school education, and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor.\"St. Paul - \"The character of the person called St Paul, according to the accounts given of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism. He had persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards. The stroke he had received, had changed his thinking wihout altering his constitution; and, either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot. Such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach. They are always in extremes, as well of action as of belief.\"Invented religions - \"All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish appear to me to be no other than human inventions set up to enslave and terrify mankind and monopolize power and profit. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\"Dark Ages - \"Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the Age of Ignorance commenced with the Christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterward.\"Morality - \"As to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered in the old and new testaments they make no part of this pretended thing, revealed religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience and bonds by which society it held together, and without which it cannot exist, and are nearly the same in all religions and all societies. In revealed religion morality is banished to make room for an imaginary thing called faith.\"Mystery - \"the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is the fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion.\"To Thine Own Self Be True - \"I do not condemn those who believe in established religions. They have the right to their beliefs. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.\" When I started reading Common Sense I had a hard time because the text was so dense, but when I decided to read it aloud, the text came to life--it was like discovering Shakespeare. Actually, the second set of texts is a collection of about ten essays called \"The American Crisis\" (numbered 1-10), and I thought these were even better. In them Paine tries to convince the American public that Great Britain doesn't have a chance against the 13 Colonies. Sort of like the Iraqi Information Minister telling his people that the Iraqi's will \"roast the American soldier's stomaches in hell\", while American shells explode in the background, shaking the building he's speaking from. The oratory of other greats such as Jim Carvill and Muhammad Ali came to mind, too, but the text is so well written, as to approach Shakespeare.\"These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\"It's almost comical, in retrospect, because he address a few essays directly to the British General in charge, Sir William Howe. To the most powerful general in the world he says, \"England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of a cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier, and by the sample we have taken prisoners we begin to give the preference to ourselves.\"He does make good points, but the abuse, both exaggerated and level-headed, just goes on and on. It was truly a pleasure to read. And even though the pages turned slowly, it just felt good to savor his words.The book is about 800+ pages, so reading the whole collection like a novel is just too much work for most. The varied texts (about 35 in total) are arranged chronollgically, which is nice. Besides Paine's major works, Common Sense, The Crisis, the Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, there is also a nice smattering of smaller essays.Additionally, there are very helpful footnotes in the back of the collection, but there are no numbers within the text; the notes are listed by page and line number.The essays were written about very topical subjects, so it is most helpful to have done a fair amount of general reading before attempting to tackle Paine so you know what he is talking about, though the notes do help. There is also a very nice chronolgy of Paine's life in the back, as well.It was an absolute pleasure reading these primary source texts. I understand now why Common Sense sold 120,000 copies within months of being published and what an essential role Thomas Paine played in keeping up the spirits of the colonists during the very discouraging early years of the War of Independence.A previous reviewer commented on how the high-quality, super-thin pages made the text small, light-weight, and easy to read.

         "1.0",
         "Raising an extremely bright child - quick, curious, sensitive, and introspective - is a daunting challenge. Parents need insight into their own motivations (as well as those of their children), and the courage and ability to make tough decisions about their child's development. \"Raising Gifted Kids\" will help parents understand and cope with the obstacles they face in raising a gifted child, and help them make the best choices for their son's or daughter's growth and happiness. Barbara Schave Klein Family & Relationships",
         "\"Raising Gifted Kids\" was the first book I read that described gifted children, and it did have some interesting insights that got my mind thinking, but I find that overall, I finished the book feeling full of anxiety about what to do with my child. Subsequent books I have read, have given me a fuller picture of the issue and have shed light on the shortcomings of this book. I have a hard time recommending it.This book is filled with anecdotes about gifted children. The stories more or less fall into two patterns. In the \"warning\" stories the pattern is \"Child A was gifted. His parents pushed him too hard. He became a perfectionist, and killed himself as a teenager.\" Or \"Child A was gifted. His parents never challenged him enough. He became frustrated with the difficulties of higher education, so wound up becoming an elementary school teacher (as if that meant his life was a failure)\".The \"success\" stories are generally along the lines of \"Child 'A' was gifted. Her parents hired a psychological advisor, so that they knew the right thing to do. The child became a doctor, and they all lived happily ever after.\" Since the author is one of these psychologist experts, the general emphasis on finding professional help comes across as very self serving. The author's subtle, though persistent implications that some career paths are not worthy of \"gifted\" children comes across as elitist and narrow minded.I have since read a few other gifted children books, and I have learned that there are more or less two camps when it comes to gifted children. There are some who believe that giftedness is an indication that a child has a genetic gift that \"should\" lead that child to grow into a super-achieving adult. This is the type of gifted child model this book talks about. The author puts a lot of emphasis on the idea that if your gifted child doesn't grow up to be an exceptional world changing adult, that somehow the parents have not done a proper job raising the child.The second camp, and the one that the very helpful book \"Being Smart About Gifted Children\" covers well, is that it is often healthier for the child if parents and educators approach giftedness as a temporary state and spend time addressing any current difficulties that a child's giftedness might bring about. For example, if a child is suddenly finding 2nd grade math to be boring, figure out how to make it exciting. To be avoided, though, is to burden a child with a label, just because they happen to be really good at math at a young age. Often it is the case that giftedness does NOT result in a super-achieving adult, and that is perfectly normal. This book is for anyone who has ever wondered if a child under their care might be gifted, and what to do about it. It's full of affective approaches to a wide range of puzzling, exhausting, and endearing behaviors, and important considerations for educational options. The author has a friendly writing style and is a great source of comfort, confirmation, and inspiration; I will be referring to this book often in the upcoming years. The author uses her expertise in the area of child devlopment and her vast experience working with gifted children and their families to present a reader friendly guide to parenting gifted children. This book is an excellent resource for parents, teachers, school psychologists and principals.",

         "Typography may be unique among arts in its historical ties to commerce. Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use.

         "6.0",
         "'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication. Ronald Hutton Body, Mind & Spirit",
         "Answer: What would you like it to be changed into?This is a sympathetic book towards neo-pagans. Ironically, because Hutton does not buy the party line of a pre-historic, nature religion whose tecahings have survived in an unbroken line through family clans, it's not popular with advocates of the matriarchal apostolic succession. In other words, pop Wicca 101 writers hate his guts.A Wicca, in case you haven't got a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary handy is a 'male witch' ( as contrasted with Wicce, a female )However if you've changed your name to Snowflake, Blackjack-for-my-Tribe, or some other Native American or Celtic ..., it's re-defined as someone who practises the 'Craft of the Wise', and to Hades with linguistic analysis. Who do these scholars think they are, anyway?Native American names are popular, since they had a splendid history of women's rights. Celtic ones are also cool, since the Druids were an all male priesthood who, like the Aztecs, practised human sacrifice , but c'mon, those redheaded Irish babes were hot!All Praise to Brigid!Wiccans or Witches are NOT--as they never tire of pointing out to the public--Satanists.Which of course makes absolutely no difference to the majority of Jews, Christians or Muslims, let alone fundamentalist ones; but I imagine it must be a source of great relief to Satanists, who consider Wiccans fluffy, neo-pagans, with atrocious taste in poetry. Hate to to say it, but they've got a point.\"The Charge of the Goddess\", for example, is a watered down ... of Crowley's Egyptian hymn to Nuit. Hutton suggests Wiccans would be better of with the lunar poetry of Shelley, Keats, Graves and other romantics.I hope I'm not making it sound like Hutton is ridiculing anyone;s religion. He's not. He's an old school Brit and goes out of his way to be cordial. It's just that the man IS a historian, so faced with some of the more bizarre claims of 'Traditional Wiccans' his polite response may sound to some hard core believers as if he's punching out the Tooth Fairy in front of a kindergarten class.For example, take the question of how a pagan polytheistic religion, whether invented or re-discovered in England by the likes of Gardner, Sanders, Dion Fortune and company--who were politically somehere to the monarchical right of Attila The Hun, cross over to the USA and become an evangelical, feminist, ecolological and de facto monotheistic (THE Goddess )religion?It's a fascinating historical tour de force by Hutton, a mystery story that weaves the threads of archeology from Sir Arthur Evans in Crete to Mariaja Gimbutas in Anatolia; combining the longings of 19th century Romantic writers--Charlotte Bronte included--to the celebration of Yule and other worldwide nature rites, to the \"Burning Times\"--a wildly revitionist view of the witch trials in medeival Europe--courtesy of Gardner, to the ancient worship of goddesses from Egpypt to Europe who were far more likely to be associated with motherhood, or war, than with rollicking about in the forest, invoking the moon.Perhaps the best defense for a belief in a worlwide Lady and Lord of the Woods pre-historical religion ( where did I put my VHS of 'The Wicker Man'?) comes from the craving of the soul. In a short story by Lovecraft, whose name I can't remember, a man brings an ancient vase to an archeologist who informs him that it's a fraud---no more than a hundred years old. The man counters by telling him that it's even more recent--he painted it himself last night, but the image came to him in a dream, and dreams are older than mankind. Hutton borders on the same point.As Robert Graves observed, though nominally The West is Christian, in actuality, most of us live as if we were ruled by what he called the 'unholy trimverate' of Pluto, god of wealth, Apollo, god of science and Mercury, god of thieves.May The Goddess protect you from having to sell used cars for a living. . . This is a veyr detailed and informative history. However the paperback edition has miniscule print on low grade paper, so much so that it is hard to read for a long period of time. I would reccomend getting the hardback. The work itself is great and it's worth paying the extra to be able to read it without needing aspirin on standby. Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job! This book has made me rethink everything I have ever taken as &quot;fact&quot; regarding to Witchcraft. Published in 1999 by the Oxford University Press, this work is clearly held to very high academic standards. The book is divided into two sections, Macrocosm and Microcosm, with subdivisions including &quot;Finding a Goddess&quot;, &quot;Finding a Folklore,&quot; &quot;God (and Goddess) Parents,&quot; &quot;Gerald Gardner,&quot; &quot;Old Craft, New Craft,&quot; &quot;Uncle Sam and the Goddess,&quot; and &quot;Grandchildren of the Shadows.&quot;I mention the above to illustrate the wide context in which this book operates. It not only is interested in historical research devoted to what today's witches term &quot;the burning times,&quot; but also to the development of the modern witchcraft movement begun by Gardner. The manner in which Mr. Hutton presents the material is both academic and yet is readable-- he clearly states when his opinions are just that-- undocumented assumptions based on reason, versus that of proven ideas, thesis, etc. The earlier chapters are a little difficult to &quot;wade through&quot; at times, but the book is more reader friendly with each chapter.The reason Triumph of the Moon is so unique is because it provides facts little known to the general public that refute earlier research on the Witch Trials of the past as well as claims that the Wicca of today is a direct descendant of ancient pagan lineage.Although Mr. Hutton does not align himself with Wicca, Paginsim, or Witchcraft, he has been allowed to study, interview, and even circle with over 21 covens in England.This book is a must read for every Pagan, Wiccan, Witch or anyone interested in history. This is what history books should be printing",

         null,
         "This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation. John E. Hesselgreaves Science",

         "The Gifted Adult: A Revolutionary Guide for Liberating Everyday Genius(tm)",
         "1.0",
         "Are you relentlessly curious and creative, always willing to rock the boat in order to get things done . . . extremely energetic and focused, yet constantly switching gears . . . intensely sensitive, able to intuit subtly charged situations and decipher others' feeling? If these traits sound familiar, then you may be an Everyday Genius--an ordinary person of unusual vision who breaks the mold and isn't afraid to push progress forward. . . . As thought-provoking as Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, psychologist Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's Gifted Adults draws on a wide range of groundbreaking research and her own clinical experience to show America's twenty million gifted adults how to identify and free their extraordinary potential. Gifted Adults presents the first practical tool for rating your Evolutionary Intelligence Quotient through an in-depth personality-type profile. Demystifying what it means to be a gifted adult, this book offers practical guidance for eliminating self-sabotage and underachievement, helping Everyday Geniuses and those who know, love, and work with them to understand and support the exceptional gifts inherent in these unique personality traits. Mary-Elaine Jacobsen Psychology",
         "I agree with the other reviews in that this book is an eye opener if you are not already aware of the 'new' research into giftedness. I would like to make two comments though.First, as one reviewer puts it, the book is lavish on the description of the gifted' characteristics and the difficulties that they encounter in their lives, but is lacking in now-what-do-I do. This is not exactly true. There are many pieces of advice that the author gives on how you can manage those traits that make it so difficult to fit in. However, it takes time for what you've read to sink in. For example, suppose that your social life has not been that great lately and you start feeling depressed. Looking back in time at similar situations, you'd probably decide that you need to make more friends or even find a partner. However, that may not really be the case. It could be that, as the author has so written, you have not been entertaining that necessity of the gifted to have a continual indulging in some kind of interest or passion. As the author puts it, the gifted have `multiple interests' and must always be involved in some kind of pursuit or another. Whenever you feel the blues, turn to the book, look hard and you'd probably find what you're looking for. Most likely, the advice contained in the book can be condensed to fit on just one page; but every single advice is priceless if you take a pause and give it the consideration and time of thought that it needs in order to be effective and long-lasting. The problem is that the book can never substitute for therapy and trying to use it as a manual or workbook is just extremely hard work as is the case with any book anyway. You'd have to be a professional yourself.My second comment is that I find interesting analogies between the Lion sign of western astrology, the Dragon sign of Chinese astrology and the gifted' description. I'd say that these characteristics have been observed throughout the ages and there's nothing really new under the sun except that these traits are now being studied using the 'modern' tools of human psychology.Last, I'd like to say that since it feels very awkward to call yourself gifted, how about `smd' , sensitivity more developed, since the term `hsp' has already been coined. I'd say that the gifted are most different from others in their sensitivity. Like the French say, these people have `une sensibilit&eacute; &agrave; fleur de peau'. To be a `smd' is a way of life and, alas, a constant struggle. As a gifted adult myself, this book has helped me understand many aspects of the process of becoming a conscious gifted adult. I've ordered this book for the second time, to share it with a close friend of mine. Instead of being study literature (like 'How the gifted brain learns', which, for other purposes, is another excellent read - mostly if you are teaching or coaching gifted people), the book is mostly full of 'aha-moments' and reads quite easily. I discovered a kind of trajectory in the book, where I naturally found my 'spot'; so there's three 'parts' regarding past, now and future hidden in the book.The first part is mostly recognizing and reframing the past. It describes cases, including the auther herself at some point, about the process from being full of perceptions about yourself (all the typical elements of gifted people are translated into negative views, mostly how non-gifted people perceive the gifted) until realizing how these elements many of us got to dislike or hate in their lives can be qualities.The second part, including the Evolutionary Intelligence model, contains some tools to get more insight into your personal development needs. This felt for me as the 'now'.Also, the author describes how she got to do work that connects directly to her soul calling, or life mission, or personal passion as you will. A life-changing insight for me, which I found also in other books, is that with the current world-wide crisis it is no wonder that more gifted and talented people are being born. Finding our way, creating coaching and therapy for gifted people (and recognizing all the misdiagnosis going on, because of ADHD and other mental disorders in DSM-IV but no good, 'official' literature on giftedness and its effects) but also transforming our educational systems and training human resource departments at big companies, is essential to help the planet in her process. For me this is the future, I don't feel I have the role that connects exactly to this, but the call is getting stronger. So, since they say 'patience is a virtue', I train myself in taking my time. Not everything has to be finished yesterday? Aha! ;-) In an article in Advanced Development journal, Mary-Elaine Jacobsen noted the typical stereotypes of gifted people include the \"temperamental artist, or the pathetic isolate whose brainy abilities are lost in foolishness, alcoholism or chronic depression,\" and the glittering superstar in the arts or sciences with talents elevating them [more or less effortlessly] to \"an unreachable pedestal of human achievement.\"One of the great values of her book is in showing how more ordinary people with exceptional abilities and sensitivities face challenges in, first of all, recognizing themselves, then realizing their multiple talents.All too often, gifted adults [and children] get labeled as being problematical or pathological. Her book helps to better understand a range of gifted personality traits that can be embraced and used for living a more authentic and fulfilling life. This is a review of the book \"Liberating Everday Genius\" by Jacobsen; I'm not sure if this book is the same under another name or if this new book offers more than the older version previously published.I read this book in hopes that it would actually teach me how to liberate my creativity and intelligence. Unfortunately, most of what it offers is mere information and theory regarding what \"everyday genius\" is and how to tell if you are one using a rather generic \"test.\" It then goes on to dispel myths and stereotypes that most \"geniuses\" seem to experience. I know that I found a lot of myself in this book although I'm not sure I'd call myself a genius. Perhaps I overestimate what the term really means, thus fitting in to the descriptions she gives of how society pushes down anyone who thinks differently than the majority. Sadly, none of my big questions were answered such as, \"how do I overcome this programming?\" I am just as confused and feel just as alone as I did prior to reading the book, so I can't say it has been any help to me except to point out that maybe there are others out there like me. What's the point if I still feel too lost to find them and to express my \"true\" self? Much of the material is repetitive in that she presents the same ideas and concepts over and over again. I assume she's trying to drill it into the head of the reader, but perhaps it's just book filler. I think she could have compacted the material into a book half the original size, thus lowering the price in the process. If you buy it, expect to be reading a Tony Robbins type self-esteem booster...do not expect to find real answers. This is definitely best of (not many) books for gifted adults (of books not focused only on gifted children). Absolutely informative, describing everything from stories to theory and personality traits behind giftedness. There is no other book at the same level of information and help for gifted adults. I agree with other reviews - if you expect this book will give you ultimate answers and ready-made solutions to adapt to your life, you will be disappointed. It is better to expect this book to be interesting inquiry into the soul of gifted people, with several ideas what to do and what to change in your lifestyle, however you will stay alone with final decisions and this book can be inspiration for creating more ideas for changing your lifestyle. Chapters of practical help (managing gifted adult life) are not the strongest point of the book. Generally they advise you - do not be either too extreme, or too inhibited in showing up your traits. Learn to balance your self- expression. No more ideas... However you (as probably gifted adult) do not expect one book with all solutions to your life, do you? This book is definitely a must for everybody who is lost, is trying to orient, or trying to get more information about giftedness in adult people. Week points - 1) It is sometimes too repetitive and wordy, 2) Concepts like \"Evolutionary Intelligence\" or \"Everyday genius\" are useless, confusing and presented probably with understandable intention of the author to suggest new theory, however these concepts are not elaborated well and sound too \"new age\". Up-to-date psychological terminology would be sufficient. Still, five stars are absolutely fair for this book.",

As stated by Derrida, &quot;every drawing of 'the blind' is a drawing 'of' the blind.&quot; More than just an example of applied deconstruction, Derrida's reading of these drawings questions the very foudnation of western ideologies of 'looking' and 'seeing' taken for granted as self-evident by artists for centuries. By the end, one wonders who is the author, the artist, the curator?, as Derrida does more with these drawings 'for drawing' than they ever did for drawing themselves.

         "This is an excellent brief work on Prof. Jay's system. Although the book is comparatively short, at least 50 and probably more like 100 techniques are shown. Techniques are divided between throws, wrist locks, elbow locks, leglocks, and finger locks. Vulnerable areas of the body and how to attack them are shown also.Another nice feature is Prof. Jay discusses his overall theory of jujitsu and mechanical and martial principles involved, of which there are 10, which he goes into in some detail. Some of these will not be new to any experienced martial artist, such as the importance of balance, but others, such as his push-pull method of doing holds and locks, may be new.Of course one can't learn a martial art from a book, but if you have some previous knowledge, this book is an excellent introduction and/or review of many of the techniques in Prof. Jay's system. The system I practice has enough overlap so that I found this book a great way to reference and learn somemore about it. I've also had the opportunity to attend two of Prof. Jay's seminars over the years, and would like to say they were great as I expected, and it was a honor to finally meet and get to learn from such a great teacher. And he has put a lot of that knowledge into this book. Wally Jay is an original, as well as a Hall of Fame martial arts instructor. This book must be one of the 5 or 10 best martial arts books available. It includes 11 wrist locks, 7 finger locks, 10 arm locks, 5 leg locks, 17 throws, 11 chokes, and 45 self defense moves against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs, and arm bars. The step by step explanations are clear, and the large photos are helpful. All you need is a willing partner and you are well on your way to learning Wally Jay's awesome fighting system based on a simple twist of the wrist. This book is great! It shows several techniques using Wally Jay's Small-Circle theory that work effectively and can be learned quickly. This book is great for people who have experience in the fighting arts or for people who don't. The techniques are clearly described with easy-to-follow, step-by-step illustrations. I highly recommend this book, one of the best martial arts books I've read!! I Like this book. I think that is great for introduction to Jujitsu as well as a supplementing reference to jujitsu for one who is already practicing the martial art. The techniques covered in the book do work for appropriate situations. While no martial art is so complete as to deal with every conflict situation in which one may find oneself, Small Circle Jujitsu offers a good range of techniques to deal with many common assault scenarios. Small Circle Jujitsu Offers the defender the potential advantage of achieving control over an attacker with minimum effort and an option of not causing injury to attacker once he has been subdued. Karate, Kung Fu, and Boxing do not have these optional advantages.All the technigues are labled, described and explained in english as opposed to many other books which label techniques in Japanese. I think that this serves well the beginning student of Jujitsu who may know nothing of Japanese language or culture; but may still want to learn an efficient means of self defense. I suspect that the use of Japanese terminology in an English culture might even intimidate many prospective Jujitsu students from ever taking up the martial art simply because they cannot even pronounce the words.The book itself is divided into 5 chapters. Beginning students should pay attention to the rules of safety included towards the front of the book. This is because some of the techniques can cause serious injury.Topics covered in the book include falls, exercises, resuscitation, weak points of the body, wrist locks, finger locks, arm bars, arm locks, leg locks, throwing techniques, chokes, as well as defenses against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs.The explanations and pictures of techniques are easy to follow and understand.I think one of the things that make this book such a good value is because the reader also has the option of buying a series of videos and DVD's by the same title and author which show the student the motion and application of smooth, continous transition of techniques which cannot be captured by still pictures and explanatory text. The DVD's can be played back in slow motion which is a learning advantage in any sport. The VHS videos and DVD's can be bought from Amazon.com or direct from Black Belt Magazine at WWW.Blackbeltmag.com.Videos and DVD's can be bought separately or as a complete set. Black Belt Magazine sometimes offers the whole set of 5 VHS tapes or DVD's at the price of 4 tapes or DVD's. Look for the offer if interested.I give this book and the videos 5 each stars because it is evident that Professor Wally Jay really invested much time and effort into making sure that students will be able to understand and make use of the contents of the book and videos of Small Circle Jujitsu as a means of an efficient and effective means of self defence.Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 1 - FoundationsSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 3 - Grappling TechniquesSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and ArmlocksNihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 1Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 2Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 5Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-DefenseChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12",

Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think. This was a very impressive tale covering three generations of women of different classes in the history of El Salvador. Even if you have never been to that country nor know a lot of the history the story is gripping. The relations between the various women are beautifully drawn and are good and interesting enough to overcome the sometimes tedious effort to tell the history of the country. The book contains many jewels of small and simple things people do for and with each other. The letter of Caecilia at the end of the book is an example of absolute literary beauty and I will not forget that scene for a long time.In the best traditions of Isabel Allende and G.G.Marquez.

         "\"A set of ancient inscriptions on marble found forty years ago in southern Italy, recording details so bewildering that scholars have kept silent about them ... Sensational new information about a group of ancient philosophers who were so intensely practical that, two and a half thousand years ago, they shaped our existence and the world we live in ... These are just two ingredients of this extraordinary book, which uncovers an astonishing reality right at the origins of the Western world. Written by one of the most highly-acclaimed contemporary historians and experts in the field, it provides dramatic new evidence about the most important of ancient philosophers, Parmenides—and revolutionizes our understanding of the history of religion, of the origins of philosophy, and of Western culture as a whole.\"-- Peter Kingsley Body, Mind & Spirit",
         "This book reads like a mystery story, or rather a story aboutmystery. It is based on solid academic scholarship, but is by no meanswritten in an academic style. Rather, it is a highly personal account of the author's discoveries about a famous Greek philosopher, Parmenides, and the philosopher's surprising secret. A philosopher whom thousands of years of academic scholarship and philosophy regarded as a dry logician, turns out to be the representative of an authentic Mediterranean tradition of mystical practice. Kingsley's writing takes on an almost religious intensity in places; he writes like a man with a vision, trying to awaken those who have suppressed or forgotten their own spiritual connections. DARK PLACES OF WISDOM is something that can transcend the seminars and the classrooms, reaching out to spiritual searchers who are sick of the banalities of our society and are questing for a more direct experience of the divine. According to Kingsley, this is how that quest, and that experience, was done back in the Sicilian colonies of ancient Greece, 2500 years ago. And that tradition that Kingsley discovers, has been hidden in the depths of our Western culture and consciousness ever since. If you want an adventure which is both intellectual AND mystical, try this book. END Like other reviewers, I found Kingsley's style irritating and almost condescending, as though he were an explorer of great experience and wisdom trying to convey something of the sense of wonder to people who are not very capable of understanding specifics. However, he did hit upon one thing that is VERY important -- but I see no sign that he himself understood what it meant.Kingsley talks about the iatromantis guiding people lying in dark caves - and seems to think it has something to do with them preparing themselves for their eventual death. But I don't think it was that at all. When I read that I thought, \"these people are doing what we did at the Monroe Institute - depriving the senses of input to make it easier to concentrate on inner images so that they could learn to experience and use unusual mental states at will.\" I expect they went through specific exercises in those dark spaces, probably accompanied with some rhythmic background sound, as shamanism uses.Kingsley is perhaps too enmeshed in the academic mindset to realize that these people were having a real experience that we today can share. Of course my guess may be wrong, but it is part of the value of Kingsley's book that it gives rise to just such speculations.I give it a one for style and a 5 for content, so the result is a three. After so many positive reviews I was excited to get and read this book. I have to say I'm disappointed. Firstly, it feels like the tone and approach Kingsley uses is geared towards children or teenagers; it's strange. Frankly, I don't like his use of the English language, I find it stilted. I kept thinking--get to the point, man.He's trying to do a couple of things at once, so far as I could see: create a kind of suspense story with the discovery of some statues with inscriptions on it and also to lay out what Parmenides was &lt;really> saying. I wasn't interested in the first aim--and I could barely follow his \"conclusions.\" As far as the second, well... it doesn't sound all that different than what one can glean from the Upanishads or the Tao Te Ching or Chuang Tzu. But Kingsley posits it as the \"missing key\" in a sense.It is missing a glossary; and with a totally jumbled up \"references\" section it's very hard to know where he got his information. I appreciate his effort but I think he took himself a little too seriously.",

         null,
         "THE DHARMA BUMS appeared just one year after the author's explosive ON THE ROAD had put the Beat Generation on the literary map and Kerouac on the best-seller list. The same expansiveness, humour and contagious zest for life that sparked the earlier novels sparks this one too, but through a more cohesive story. The books follow two young men engaged in a passionate search for dharma or truth. Their major adventure is the pursuit of the Zen way, which takes them climbing into the high sierras to seek the lesson of solitude. With an Introduction by Kerouac expert, Ann Douglas. Jack Kerouac Fiction",
         "Needed this for a college class and money was tight and not having to pay the bookstore price really helped. Thank you. Better than `On The Road' (not putting it down). This is a truly amazing book. If you are hesitating about buying it, I assure you it will be money very well spent. You can't help but love this guy; he possesses the most beautifully innocent, intelligent, honest mind. Pack your bag and head for the hills. Read all of his books. 'The Dharma Bums' is a tale of social dropouts in California who search for Buddhist enlightenment and truth (dharma) amid wine, sex, hitchhiking and mountain scenery. It's a good introduction to Kerouac - shorter, lighter and more accessible than On the Road, which is a more epic but also has some monotonous bits.If religious certainties turn you off, you might tire of dharma-bum narrator Ray's Buddhist slogans and the dogmatic Zen views of Japhy, Ray's buddy. But though Kerouac portrays Buddhism as liberating, he also laughs a lot at kooky piety. At some points - like Ray's 'banana sermon' - religion becomes either profound or hilarious, or both.Ray tries to reach nirvana by convincing himself the world's an illusion, which makes it ironic that the best bits in this novel are poetic descriptions of mountains and travel. The final lonely mountain-top vigil - based on Kerouac's experience as a fire lookout, described in Lonesome Traveller - is a tour de force. Kerouac's prose flair allows him to string 10 adjectives in front of a noun, a heinous crime in modern writing fashion, and get away with it.Kerouac balances Ray and Japhy's Buddhist belief that the world is illusory against the earthbound views of world-weary poet Alvah Goldbook, a thinly veiled Allen Ginsberg. Alvah's quest to soak up his surroundings rather than transcend them puts him closer to the philosophy of On the Road, in which the travelling bums reach a jubilant but sad-hearted state of raw appreciation of their phsyical world.Through the Ray-Japhy-Alvah triangle and all the minor characters, 'The Dharma Bums' gives various answers to Kerouac's big question in this and other books: how to lead a free existence in a conformist careerist consumerist society. Fifty years later, the question's got more vital. Youthful rebellion and boheme are just marketing motifs for soft drinks, CDs and snowboards now, but Kerouac shows you it's possible to be authentically free - if you have the guts. Following the success of \"On the Road\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \"The Subterraneans\" and \"Tristessa.\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \"On the Road.\" Kerouac responded with \"The Dharma Bums\" which was published late in 1958. \"The Dharma Bums\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole. The book was critiqued by Allen Ginsberg and others close to Kerouac as a \"travelogue\" and as over-sentimentalized. But with the exception of \"On the Road\", \"The Dharma Bums\" remains Kerouac's most widely read work. I had the opportunity to reread \"The Dharma Bums\" and came away from the book deeply moved.As are all of Kerouac's novels, \"The Dharma Bums\" is autobiographical. It is based upon Kerouac's life between 1956--1957 -- before \"On the Road\" appeared and made Kerouac famous. The book focuses upon the relationship between Kerouac, who in the book is called Ray Smith and his friend, the poet Gary Snyder, called Japhy Ryder, ten years Kerouac's junior. Kerouac died in 1969, while Snyder is still alive and a highly regarded poet. Allen Ginsberg (Alvah Goldbrook) and Neal Cassady (Cody Pomeray), among others, also are characters in the book. Most of the book is set in San Francisco and its environs, but there are scenes of Kerouac's restless and extensive travelling by hitchiking, walking, jumping freight trains, and taking buses, as he visits Mexico, and his mother's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the course of the book.The strenght of \"The Dharma Bums\" lies in its scenes of spiritual seriousness and meditation. During the period described in the book, Kerouac had become greatly interested in Buddhism. He describes himself as a \"bhikku\" -- a Buddhist monk -- and had been celibate for a year when the book begins. I have been studying Buddhism myself for many years, and it is easy to underestimate Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism. As with many authors, he was wiser in his writing that he was in his life. There is a sense of the sadness and changeable character of existence and of the value of compassion for all beings that comes through eloquently in \"The Dharma Bums.\" Smith and Ryder have many discussions about Buddhism -- at various levels of seriousness -- during the course of the novel. Ryder tends to use Buddhism to be critical of and alienated from American society and its excessive materialism and devotion to frivolity such as television. Smith has the broader vision and sees compassion and understanding as a necessary part of the lives of everyone. Smith tends to be more meditative and quiet in his Buddhist practice -- he spends a great deal of time in the book sitting and \"doing nothing\" while Ryder is generally active and on the go, hiking, chopping wood, studying, or womanizing. At the end of the book, he leaves for an extended trip to Japan. (He and Kerouac would never see each other again.)\"The Dharma Bums\" offers a picture of a portion of American Buddhism during the 1950s. It also offers a portrayal of what has been called the \"rucksack revolution\" as Smith and Ryder take to the outdoors, and, in a lengthy and famous section of the book, climb the \"Matterhorn\" in California's Sierra Mountains. In the final chapters of the book, Kerouac spends eight isolated weeks on Desolation Peak in the Cascades as a fire watchman. He comes back yearning for human company.Sexuality plays an important role in the book, against the backdrop of what is described as the repressed 1950's, as young girls are drawn to Ryder and he willingly shares them with an initially reluctant Smith. The book includes scenes of wild parties tinged, for Smith, with sadness, in which people of both sexes dance naked, get physically involved, and drink heavily. Near the end of the book, Ryder offers Smith a prophetic warning the alcoholism which would shortly thereafter ruin Kerouac's life.\"The Dharma Bums\" is a fundamentally American book and it is full of love for the places of America, for the opportunity it offers for spiritual exploration, and for its people. Kerouac's compassion was hard earned. In his introduction to a later book, \"The Lonesome Traveller\" heaptly described his books as involving the \"preachment of universal kindness, which hysterial critics have failed to notice beneath frenetic activity of my true-story novels about the 'beat' generation. -- Am actually not 'beat' but strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic.\" I found a feeling of spirituality, of love of life in the face of vicissitudes, and of America in \"The Dharma Bums.\" The work was indeed a popularization. But Kerouac's vision may ultimately have been broad.Robin Friedman Man, I don't know where to start. \"The Dharma Bums\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \"Wail\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \"Howl\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic.While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \"The Dharma Bums\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again. Dealing with Amazon was so easy, this was my first time buying from this site and it was so easy,quick and was delivered very fast. Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing. Yes, &quot;On The Road&quot; gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; soars as high as &quot;Big Sur&quot; dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors. Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer. It made me want to live my life without shackles, free like Kerouac's character Japhy (Gary Snyder), climbing mountains and writing poetry. It captures the Boho 50's era like no other, especially in the Bay Area. Finally, it inspired me to learn more about Buddhism and eventually spend a year in a Buddhist monastery. I've never met someone who has read The Dharma Bums and hasn't loved it. It's one of the best books of the 20th century.By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac. Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer.

I've never met someone who has read The Dharma Bums and hasn't loved it. It's one of the best books of the 20th century.By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha Having heard me praise this book countless times, my wife finally read it for herself. Her response? \"You know, I was expecting some stereotype of `cool' Beatniks, trying to be so hip and detached. But that's just some popular media image. The people in this book are exuberant, thoughtful, even spiritual!\" That sums it up as well as anything. Forget the glib idea of alterna-cultural one-upmanship that passes for a Beat attitude these days - \"The Dharma Bums\" is about nave exuberance, anything-but-ironic soul-searching, an eager exploration of life's sorrows and joys, and the sheer, exhilarating, wondrous zest of being alive and aware in an endlessly fresh world. If reading this clear mountain stream of a book doesn't make you want to change your life and your way of looking at life, then you're just hopelessly blind to something precious! Life is so much more than the neatly packaged, pre-imagined commercial that society would love to sell you, and \"The Dharma Bums\" will gladly show you one possible way of finding your true path. Length:: 4:02 Mins I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands. I have just finished this book and really enjoyed the written word. It has a free flowing style which is mesmerising and relaxing to read. I am old enough to remember the times it was written in and they were very optomistic and free.However I was reading the book in 2012 and times have changed. The materalistic world has engulfed us and freedom and free thinking seem to be things of the past. The drug culture is now feared and grave consequences of participation in it are promoted.Perhaps sadly all I can say is that the bubble has burst.",

         "2.0",
         "This book is a simple, easy-to-read guide to debunking health scares and scams before you get hurt. Steven J. Milloy Reference",
         "Hardly a day can pass without hearing about some new threat to our health from something in our food or in the air that we breathe. In his lively style, Steven J. Milloy has written a &quot;self-defense guide&quot; to help the average consumer know when to be alarmed or when to proceed with life as usual.Junk Science Judo is filled with examples of questionable conclusions drawn from data from a wide variety of sources. Milloy relates how zealous lawyers can draw false or misleading inferences from scientific data in order to extract large rewards from lawsuits against defendants with deep pockets, often with collaboration from those in the &quot;scientific&quot; community who stand to profit from their &quot;research&quot; (what better way to justify large government grants to continue research into some promising area?). Most telling are the cases of the lawsuits involving breast implants and Agent Orange, where a total absence of evidence was ignored by courts and juries eager to punish unpopular defendants and to reward those who were definitely disadvantaged (but probably not as a result of either the implants or Agent Orange).Despite a generally good job of writing a primer on how not to be taken in by faulty conclusions or misleading inferences of cause and effect, Chapter 11 of this book contains one significantly dubious conclusion of the author himself. In a discussion of the statistical technique of meta-analysis (a technique where the results of numerous small studies are combined to simulate one large study), Milloy repeatedly takes stabs at this respected technique. His criticisms appear to be based mainly on questions raised in an editorial in a medical journal where the editor cited poor data quality and publication bias (i.e., only research studies showing significant results tend to get published) as reasons for questioning conclusions from meta-analysis. Although the editor is correct, it does not follow that all meta-analysis is therefore useless. Given enough well-executed studies without bias in the findings, meta-analysis can be a very useful and enlightening tool.I highly recommend that all consumers of information either purchase this book or at least borrow it from someone, and read it thoroughly. I suspect that you will never again be able to read uncritically any account of some purported new crisis brought on by zealous lawyers, journalists or politicians. When some &quot;scientific&quot; conclusion appears to be counterintuitive, it is most likely incorrect. Subsequent research may, in fact, show that the conclusions were incorrect, but (since this is not exciting) the correction is likely not to be brought to the public's attention. Since it is impossible to prove a negative, the burden of proof should be on the scientific community to exercise caution in releasing insignificant findings to the press. Junk science may sell newspapers or gain an audience for the evening news, but it is devastating when it causes major disruptions in the lives of people who either aren't given the whole picture or who can't interpret the information when it is presented.The best defense against junk science is an informed public. Read this book and you will definitely become better informed! Steven Milloy is the self proclaimed \"director\" of The Advancement for Sound Science Coalition also known as TASSC. This coalition is a think tank for corporate interests. The objective of the TASSC is to debunk modern scientific research that concludes corporate pollution has serious consequences on he environment.So Steven's objective is to discredit any scientific findings that come to the conclusion that corporate America's pollution has now and will continue to have global effects on the environment. So he criticizes the results of real scientists that are doing objective research and labels them as radical liberals. He calls their science \"junk science\" .The only slip in reasoning here is that the scientists that conclude big business pollution is destructive to the environment and our health weren't paid by billion dollar Industries to come to these conclusions.Steven Milloy and TASSC are funded gratuitously by corporate America to debunk global warming and any other scientific findings that run counter to corporate America's interests.Originally TASSC was funded by Philip Morris with the goal of debunking the scientific conlusion that second hand smoke is hazardous to your health. Would you believe that? If I was paid a million dollars by Phillip Morris to say second hand smoke is not dangerous to your health would you believe me? I really hope not. But that is just what Steven Milloy does. He gets paid enormously by corporate America to say that environmental scientists (who weren't paid off to come to specific conclusions) are the one's producing the junk science. His original funding came from Phillip Morris but TASSC is funded by the following corporations: 3M, Amoco, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Motors, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lorillard Tobacco, Louisiana Chemical Association, National Pest Control Association, Occidental Petroleum, Philip Morris Companies, Procter & Gamble, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and W.R. Grace, the asbestos and pesticide manufacturers.If you think I'm making this all up do a Google search on \"Steven J. Milloy Spin doctoring\" or \"Steven J. Milloy Phillip Morris\" and see all of the legitimate resources that expose his true ulterior motives. That is, if you actually do care about the truth more than you care about not being labeled as a liberal radical.The name calling is how these billion dollar corporations enforce compliance by labeling dissenters as deviants. If you care about the environment you are a bleeding heart liberal, if you don't support the United States occupation and Halliburton's profiteering in Iraq you are unpatriotic and sometimes even considered a terrorist. These God and Jesus spewing billionaires define right and wrong and what is moral according to their own interests. They will pay pseudo scientists like Steven J. Milloy enormous sums of money to make it appear that there is scientific evidence to support their agenda.",

         "The story of the woman taken in adultery features a dramatic confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees over whether the adulteress should be stoned as the law commands. In response, Jesus famously states, “Let him who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” To Cast the First Stone traces the history of this provocative story from its first appearance to its enduring presence today. Likely added to the Gospel of John in the third century, the passage is often held up by modern critics as an example of textual corruption by early Christian scribes and editors, yet a judgment of corruption obscures the warm embrace the story actually received. Jennifer Knust and Tommy Wasserman trace the story’s incorporation into Gospel books, liturgical practices, storytelling, and art, overturning the mistaken perception that it was either peripheral or suppressed, even in the Greek East. The authors also explore the story’s many different meanings. Taken as an illustration of the expansiveness of Christ’s mercy, the purported superiority of Christians over Jews, the necessity of penance, and more, this vivid episode has invited any number of creative receptions. This history reveals as much about the changing priorities of audiences, scribes, editors, and scholars as it does about an “original” text of John. To Cast the First Stone calls attention to significant shifts in Christian book cultures and the enduring impact of oral tradition on the preservation—and destabilization—of scripture.

James Lam Business & Economics",
         "A well-written guide to enterprise risk management from somebody who knows it first hand. The book covers all of the relevant topics within ERM: concepts and processes, governance, risk transfer, analytics, risk types, and applications to the business (lessons learned, case studies, etc.).The book is tilted towards banking and energy and could use an update on how ERM has become vogue among corporations in almost every other sector. It could also include more information on operational risk and Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, as well as more recent info on the topic from leading risk organizations and projects (COSO and others). It is not a one stop shop on the subject - hence just four stars.If you have a chance to work with risk managers and/or risk consultants, see the latest dashboard tools, or sit in on risk assessment and ranking exercises, I believe you'll get much more from the book. There is a lot of \"dot-connecting\" that needs to go on with ERM.And a special endorsement...I once received a very attractive offer from a leading Fortune 500 company for an enterprise risk manager position. I had just a little experience with ERM, but I used material from this book to get me through six probing interviews. Very few books can help a candidate quite the way this one helped me. This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author&iexcl;s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management. If you are a budding Risk Manager/ Officer or are considering a career move towards Risk Management, this book is a good high-level illustration of what the major sleeves of Risk Management has to offer.For the experienced risk professional, this is a bit too fundamental.",

She agrees hoping her efforts and that of others will stop the Nazi evil, but she also hides what she does from her loved ones including Curt.With the war over, though reluctant, Bette marries Curt as she believes in keeping her promise.

I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However, like most books on this topic, it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop, working in a shed, basement, attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop, but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective. I just had the final electrical installed in my shop so my shop was just about done when I found this book. Parts of this book that pointed out where I did things correctly, parts of the book point out where I should go from here.I've found that there was some good information here, but I think the best information comes from looking at the pictures of other people's shops. How do they arrange their workbenches in relation to their tool boxes, how do they store their clamps, how do they store their wood, etc.Overall, I think Taunton Press's &quot;The Workshop Book&quot; is a better resource for these kinds of ideas. This book is nice, but The Workshop Book goes into much more detail. Recieved in Good Condition. Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well.",

In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

         "Many Latin teachers are recognizing the benefits of approaching Latin as a means of communication in the classroom, thus tapping into students' natural language learning faculties, making the learning process more enjoyable and productive. Many Latin teachers are also frustrated with the lack of resources by means of which they could provide their students with vocabulary for expressing themselves.I and other teachers have spent much time compiling such vocabularies from diverse and/or obscure sources. This text, however, provides most of that informaiton in a fun, accessible, and affordable text. The book is organized into 25 short chapters, each addressing. everyday situations, from meals, to the home, to telling time. Also, the latin is decent. Any teacher who already uses latin communicatively will inevitably want to make a few changes, but this is more a matter of preference than accuracy.This is not a substitute for a high-school or college Latin textbook. It should be used as a companion or supplement. Whether one's goal is teaching Latin for communication or for reading (or some combination of the two), there is no doubt that students will \"buy in\" more if they possess the tools to express themselves and their world in the language.

         "Falling in love in spite of their warring tribes, hunter Dom and farmer Va flee from a terrible battle and journey across a stark landscape while exploring their personal views on peace and creativity. By the author of the Tripods trilogy. Simultaneous and eBook. John Christopher Juvenile Fiction",
         "First, i come to this book as an extended directed self study on the issues involved in the Creation-Evolution-Design debate. This book i rate as one of the 5 most significant books for a conservative reformed Christian who wants to come to reasoned and faithful conclusions in the CED debate. It is conservative which i define to be conscious and considerate of the traditions of the past, to take them seriously, not simply accepting something because it is new. It is Biblical in the way the author is very careful to allow the Scripture's Words to speak for themselves, being very careful not to read into the words his own cherished beliefs, but to allow the Word to speak to him, authoritatively and reliably. To this end he is not infected by the liberal J-P-D documentary interpretation so often evident in exegesis or interpretation.Second, the book is significant on two levels, the first is the exegetical level, the principles of understanding that the author explores in the first few chapters. Second is the line by line study that forms the bulk of the book, roughly chpt 3 on.The structure of the book is that of Gen 1-3 but the way he writes is interesting and worth a moment of reflection here. The chapters are more like consistent essays than the usual exegesis bound to the text. He takes a major theme in the next section of Genesis then expands it to cover this issue through the past interpreters and links to other related Scripture. It roughly follows the systematic organization of reformed covenant theology.pg 26 has what i think is the best analysis of the human writers relationship to Scripture. &quot;That rule follows from the humanity of Holy Scripture. In the act of inspiration God did not turn his sookesmen into robots; his Word became their word, under their signature and their responsiblility. Thus we have no right to go over their heads in order to set forth a 'divine' meaning which they would never possilby have imagined-even if those men did not grasp the whole import of what they attested God in his condescension has limited himself to their instrumentality; our interpretation must conform to the corresponding discipline.&quot;If the church would hend this advice much of the CED debate would be solved, for we would cease to search Genesis for the equivalent of quarks, trying to query the first few chapters of the Bible and mine it for scientific truths. Rather we would, as this author does, submit to the authority of Scripture to speak to the way we do science, to the ideas that we bring to the universe as we question the master workmen's creation that we are a small part of.The book is literary framework in its approach to Gen1-3, M. Kline being the best example of this in the english speaking world. Anyone familiar with the CED issues would be advised to read the first 2 chapters of this book simply to see a careful analysis of exegesis and the result of allowing Scripture to speak for itself rather than being pushed out of shape by young earth creationists whom would interpret the 7 days too literally. Or by scientific reconcilationists would would try to find modern science confirmed in the light appearing before the sun(ie the big bang).The first principle he outlines carefully is to allow Scripture to speak to its first listeners, their culture, their history. His exegetical task doesn't end there but extends to teaching what these things mean to us in our place in space and time. But this application, this preaching follows critical-historical interpretation not prior to it as so many would desire.Thanks to the author for this excellent book and i hope to read more from his pen.",

         "Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge. A taut masterwork of World War II historical fiction by bestselling author James Clavell. James Clavell Fiction",
         "We should be really grateful for the strike that prevented Clavell to work as a screenplay writer and director for a few weeks in the early sixties and led them to write his first novel. In this edition there is a nice prologue by his daughter explaining what prompted him to write this book, and how quickly he wrote it. The novel is a fictionalized retelling of Clavell's experiences in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore.Clavell does an amazing job in describing the personalities of the different characters that take part in the story. The fact that the camp held American, English and Australian prisoners provided him with the opportunity to showcase his acute understanding of the different cultures. If you add on top of that the Japanese and the locals that were in charge of managing the camp, you will find a wealth of characters that make this a mesmerizing read. There are two characters though, that are at the center of this tale, and whose actions could serve as a study in sociology. One is an American, the King, who is a corporal that has the ability to facilitate commerce, which is prohibited by camp rules, and therefore makes a very nice living, especially when compared with everyone else. When the King meets Peter Marlowe, a British Lieutenant, the contrast of personalities and moral codes could not be clearer. Thus starts an unusual friendship that will test Marlowe's character and convictions, since he will have to decide between compromising his morals in return for better living conditions for him and his friends, and sticking to his guns and keep on living miserably.One thing that you can tell as soon as you start reading this novel, and that is confirmed later, is that Clavell is an excellent narrator and has a gift for describing characters and give them a soul. This helps understand how he can hold the reader's attention without it wavering in lengthy novels likeShogun. In this case, the parts that deal with the secret commerce help provide the story with variety, because they speed up the pace and change the tone. It is also interesting that this edition includes the passages related to the situation of those left behind, mainly wives and kids. These provide additional insights into the lives of the prisoners, helping us understand their motivations and behavior better.In summary, this can only be defined as an excellent read. Although it has some scenes that may be hard on some readers for their brutality, I believe that the great majority of people will love it. After reading Shogun I was hungry for anything written by Clavell and went on to read King Rat (which was also made into a movie that I found to be quite good). Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read. I highly recommend it and would have given it 4 1/2 stars if allowed. James Clavell's \"King Rat\" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a \"gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon\" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero? Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway? Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: \"Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting.\" Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned. It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes\" (of TV sitcom fame). Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has \"no stomach for war\" and comes close to saying \"I know nothing-Nothing!\" Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, \"I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book. I was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin. A very good read, this novel is more \"complex\" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it. I read all of the James Clavell novels recently and enjoyed them tremendously. I learned so much about the Oriental mind and culture. I started reading King Rat thinking it would be on the same vein. At first, I thought I would stop reading it because it was about a prisoner camp but I am so happy that I persisted through the end. James Clavell's novel is such a great study of the human mind and soul. I learned a great deal and thought the novel was very thought provoking. the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl Warning: this is a disturbing book. It is gripping and enthralling, but horrifying. It shows men being tested to the utmost, and the many bad qualities this brings out. But it also shows true friendship and cooperation against adversity.Clavell truly brings to life a POW camp of Englishmen and Americans (captives of the Japanese) and the horrors they were subject to. Men help each other survive, but also betray each other, and are jealous of each other's success. The King, an American soldier, is especially envied because he is extremely skilled at trading and making deals. He and the Englishman Peter Marlowe are the main characters, but there are also stories of other men and how they survive.The ending is perhaps the most frightening part of the whole book. The prisoners are freed at the end of WWII, and as they leave the camp, they must learn to be part of the world again, and not the world they created. I won't spoil anything more. For anyone who can handle its intensity, \"King Rat\" is an eye-opening read. If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House. The smallest of the Asia series focuses sharply into a POW camp in Singapore during WWII. Unlike the other installments of the series this is intensely intimate and the author does a great job expressing the feelings and agony of survival in the camp. With the constant specter of death in its many forms (tropical diseases, betrayal and starvation) hang over these men you can't help but get involved in there tale. Over the years I have reread this one several times and continue to be fastinated with this particular work. I, myself, feel this has gained \"classic\" status and eventhough I hate the term \"a must read,\" but certainly feel this book falls into that category. The work graphically shows just what people will do when faced with circumstances completely out of their control. Recommend this read for any serious student of literature, history, miliary or otherwise, or psychology as well as those simply looking for a very good read. First of all this is the first book I have read by James Clavell and I really enjoyed it. Some of my first thoughts were that the prison was not quite as horrible as I expected, but that is where Clavell did a good job allowing us to see the prison through the eyes of the prisoners. This was a really drmactic page turner for the specific reasons that there are so many levels of plot development and happenings.The two main characters are a British air officer named Marlowe and an American named the King. This book is of course about the psyche and human nature of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. When you read through the book you will think King is not so bad and doing what it takes to survive. By the end you will see the results of his behaviors, actions, and results. The last few pages are poetic and intense. I have read a lot of novels, and this one in my opinion is up there with the classics. Also King Rat could be read by people with all kinds of varying interests and enjoy it! In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart. Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve.... I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying \"The Brothers Karamazov\". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?",

My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows.

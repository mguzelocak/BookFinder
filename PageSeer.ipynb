It contains detailed maps of 27 auto tours \"away from the interstates\" in Iowa - into what I would call the \"real Iowa\" This book contains sites along each tour. And happiest of all for me -- the sections on Northeast Iowa -- the tree-laden hills, the valleys, the Mississippi River - are full of Accurate Information! Which I'm so happy to find after years of looking through books that misrepresent us of the Driftless corner of the state. Mike Whye did his homework. If you want to see the real Iowa take a look in this book for ideas. Particularly good if you are interested in natural beauty, outdoors recreation, and historical sites -- highlights the diverse enjoyments of Iowa."

It contains detailed maps of 27 auto tours \"away from the interstates\" in Iowa - into what I would call the \"real Iowa\" This book contains sites along each tour. And happiest of all for me -- the sections on Northeast Iowa -- the tree-laden hills, the valleys, the Mississippi River - are full of Accurate Information! Which I'm so happy to find after years of looking through books that misrepresent us of the Driftless corner of the state. Mike Whye did his homework. If you want to see the real Iowa take a look in this book for ideas. Particularly good if you are interested in natural beauty, outdoors recreation, and historical sites -- highlights the diverse enjoyments of Iowa. Wonderful information and accuracy",

         "Night And Day",
         "I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was thin, action almost nonexistent--not much to it. Definitely not your typical, entertaining Robert B. Parker book. Night and Day Let's face facts -- this is not a great book. The central mystery is pretty toothless, and there are a pair of subplots (one involving a principal and another the ever-lovin' Jenn) that don't have much bite either. Even the good guys are universally, sniggeringly sex-obsessed -- Jesse can't seem to have a conversation with Molly that doesn't include a reference to her one-night stand -- which makes their investigating sex crimes a bit disturbing. And Jesse does a thing or two in the line of police work that cannot be legal.On the other hand, Parker is suddenly gone. Which means that our times with Jesse, Suit, Molly and Sunny and Spike (who visit from one of Parker's other series) is now suddenly limited. So I found myself savoring the denizens of Paradise more than I would have under other circumstances.It's below average Parker, but below average Parker is better than no Parker at all. And that makes me sad. Easy to read, hard to review I like to read a Robert Parker novel whenever I want a book that is fast and simple to read. The characters are familiar, dialogue moves the action, and you can be distracted externally, and pick up where you leave off with ease. His books are ideal for travel: like snack food. The eighth police chief Jesse Stone novel, Night and Day, focuses on the theme of obsession. Readers know that Jesse remains obsessed with his ex-wife Jenn. After a peeping Tom in the town of Paradise increases his obsession and progresses to home invasion, molestation and then murder, Stone and his police team work to track him down. Along the lines of \"it takes one to know one,\" Stone examines the obsessive Night Hawk, as they call him, from the perspective of Stone's own obsession with Jenn. Sunny Randall and Spike make cameo appearances, as does Spenser's Susan Silverman. The pace of the novel is as quick as ever, and the dialogue is peppery. Before you know it, you'll have finished the book, the flight attendant will be announcing imminent landing, and you'll be somewhat satisfied that you didn't totally waste a boring flight doing nothing.Rating: Three-star (Recommended) Obsession LOVED IT!I love all the books in the Jesse Stone Series.This one is no exception.I just love Jesse ... Plain and Simple.I picture him as Tom Selleck while reading and I am gone.Can't wait for the new Jesse Stone movie on CBS Sunday March 1st. JESSE is BACK! Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job.. Robert Parker Night and Day Katherine Hilbery has everything - she is beautiful, well-born, intelligent, kind, reflective, sensitive, though not in a sentimental way, but... bored. She must find a purpose in life, other than being of a wealthy Chelsea family and the descendant of a famous poet, and she must choose between the weak-willed sophisticate William and the tempestuous Ralph. Though the love of the self-sacrificing suffragette Mary Datchet for Ralph and the upcoming law-clerk's failure to realise he is in thrall to Katherine provide a few twists and turns, such is in essence the plot of Night and Day.All would be well if this were the psychological drama it appears to be, set in an atmospheric turn-of-the-century London. But Virginia Woolf also pursues a political message: in this novel, women answer to male stereotypes and vice versa. The women are logical and career-minded, the men coy and romantic. This might be fine, and it makes for a few good scenes, except that it doesn't quite fit the characters. Mary's ill-starred fate seems gratuitous. Katherine's interest in mathematics is too obviously a code, never properly illustrated. And her falling in love with Ralph isn't credible - she is too good for him, and it is all too sudden. It seems Night and Day can't quite choose what it is supposed to be: psychological or social comedy. It lacks the simplicity of Woolf's first novel The Voyage Out, the wistfulness of Mrs Dalloway, or the experimental complexity of her later works. Woolf's flawed second novel I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone novels; not this one! It was the usual Jesse and his Ex talking in circles around a peccadillo: a peeping Tom! Even in Paradise, I am sure something more interesting could happen! I will wait for the paper back next time Parker comes out with a new one. This deserves less than one star! Sinking Stone A delightful edition of a masterpiece! Woolf was a profound writer and she stories are deep and complex. She wrote about the feelings that most of us have experienced at one time or another. This is why her work is considered by so many of her readers as something very special. Understood by women everywhere and a book that women should read at least once, its also a good book for men to read, to help understand women.To understand love, read Night and Day.Profound! You will want to read this Night and Day! Virginia Stephens Woolf (1882-1941) was born to Sir Leslie Stephens and his second wife. His first wife was one of William Makepeace Thackery's daughters. Woolf had brothers and a sister Vanessa. She was a shy, brilliant intellectual who committed suicide in 1941. She is the best known member of the Bloomsbury Group of authors/painters/poets and intellectuals who met at her home. Among this group are: Edward Morgan Forster; T.S. Eliot: Carrington; Lytton Strachey; Vanessa and Clive Bell; Duncan Grant and Virginia's husband Leonard Woolf.Virginia Woolf's first novel was \"The Voyage Out.\" She wrote diaries throughout her life as well as criticism. Woolf also spent time teaching literature to the poor. Virgnia was a liberal who had a lesbian relationship with Vita Sackville-West. She had no children.Night and Day was the second novel by young Virginia. It was published in 1919 after the author had spent several years writing it. Woolf had long periods of time when she grappled with mental health problems spending days in bed. She was carefully attended to by her husband Leonard.The Plot: The long novel deals with the love life of Katharine Hilbery and her friend Mary Datchet. The two women are very dissimilar. Katharine comes from a literary family much like the one in which Woolf grew up. Katharine is torn between love for Ralph Denham and William Rodney. Both men are attorneys. One of Katharine's relatives named Cassandra Otway also is in love with William Rodney leading to a messy triangle. Mary Datchett is attracted to Denham. She is a worker in the Women's suffrage cause in England. In the end all the love problems are resolved.The novel is rich in the use of bird imagery to describe the emotions felt by the characters. Night is symbolic of the dreamy world often inhabited by young Katharine and her Ralph Denham who holds an idealistic dream of love. Day refers to the everyday world of London life.Though the book has its boring parts it is, nevertheless, an Edwardian novel which shows the promise of a young writer who fulfilled her potential in such better books as \"Mrs Dalloway\"; \"The Waves\"; \"Orlando\" and \"To the Lighthouse.\" These later books make much more use of stream of consciousness and indirect communication among the characters.The book may be dull to many but Woolf's beautiful writing in which she describes London and the feelings of her leading characters makes this a novel of interest. A neglected gem by a great author! Night and Day is a little known but well written classic by Virginia Woolf Another entertaining book from the hand of Robert Parker. He just keeps doing it. Parker does it again ZERO STARS. Everyone has read the complaints about Parker's latest works - double spacing, large fonts, one third pages, etc. Until you try one his books on audio, you do not know how bad it has gotten. I bought this book on CD's for a recent trip. I know the books had gotten shorter but you can't hide that in audio - the unabridged edition is a total of 5 discs with a spacer taking up half the box to make the box look normal size for a novel.On top of that, if you eliminated the amateur technique, you would remove 40% more of the book. Almost every line ends with \"name said\" - as in \"What do you think?\", Jesse said. \"I don't know.\", Molly said. When reading the books, your eyes can easily skip over this. When listening to it on audio, there is no way to tune it out. After less than half a disc, I have had to stop. Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Parker - I own every book he has published - but this may be the last. ROBERT B. PARKER - make an effort or hang it up - this is embarrassing. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Juvenile technique shows in audio Robert Parker's final Jesse Stone novel reflects the authors declining health before his death. Parker seems to be going through the motions. The dialogue remains witty and snappy but there is not much else. It appears that Parker was rushing to complete this novel before his death. You can skim read this in an hour or two.The plot revolves around a peeping Tom who is stalking women in Paradise plus sending notes to Police Chief Jesse Stone, saying he is going to take his obsession to the next level. Parker fans will enjoy but also will be disappointed. Unfortunately, this is the final book in the series but not the greatest. Latest But Not Greatest I think I've probably read everything written by Robert B. Parker. I like his pacing, his characters, his dialogue and his plots. He creates worlds of black and white and periodically it satisfies me to inhabit these worlds. I love how the mysteries unfold themselves and his ability to embrace morality without seeming cheesey. Once again, this novel made me a very happy reader.The plot for this Jesse Stone novel is easily relatable. No big time crime lords here, the story centers on quiet desperation and crossing boundaries. As always, the reader gets to witness Jesse's struggle with alcohol and women but this time, he seems to be making progress on all fronts.Robert B. Parker is in my top 5 of favorite authors and I'm already looking forward to his next novel. Fingers crossed that Private Detective Sunny Randall will be the focus of his next published effort. Old Reliable Parker Does It Again How can anyone not enjoy Jesse, Suit & Molly - every book is a delight. Love Jesse's humor and outlook on life - drinker or not! Jesse Stone does it again! After the rather awfulStranger In Paradise (Jesse Stone)I was afraid the whole series was going to just fizzle.I was pleasantly surprised with \"Night and Day\". It is a return to higher standard of reading to which I had grown accustomed. The plot moves along nicely, the witty banter is plentiful. The case is distressing but not super-hero level.I will not go into all of the plot details. Those are outlined by others on the page. All in all, this is a pleasant and quick read. Everything I look for in a Parker novel - detecting, banter, psychobabble and a bit of romance (in a macho sort of way, of course). Jesse Stone returns to form Before I jump into my review of Robert B. Parker's newest \"Jesse Stone\" novel, Night and Day, allow me to first to give a big plug for the five TV movies based on the series that Tom Selleck has produced and starred in, the most recent being Thin Ice, which was aired by CBS on Sunday, March 1st. Selleck captures the role of Jesse Stone perfectly, and each movie is a slow burn, filled with excellence on every level. If you're a fan of the novels, then you owe it to yourself to see the TV movies. Except for Thin Ice, the other four (Stone Cold, Night Passage, Death in Paradise, and Sea Change) are out on DVD. Also, CBS tends to broadcast a \"Jesse Stone\" movie every so often, so keep an eye out.Now, on to Night and Day, which is the eighth novel in the \"Jesse Stone\" series. Like the seven previous books, the small-town chief of police has to deal with three cases simultaneously, which keeps the story line moving along at a brisk pace and the reader from being bored. I probably should mention that while Jesse's attempting to solve his three cases, he's also battling his obsession with his ex-wife, Jenn, and with alcoholism, both of which are tied closely together.This time around, Jesse has to deal with a rather unusual situation that involves a female high-school principal and a panty check of the young girls going to the school dance on one particular night. The principal claims that she was only doing it to make sure the girls intended to be good and not naughty by wearing thongs and other sexy lingerie underneath their skirts. The parents of the children, however, are outraged over the act and want Jesse to do something about it. He pretty much agrees with the parents and thinks that it's definitely an invasion of privacy, but it doesn't help matters that the principal just happens to be married to the head of Boston's top law firm. Along with that problem, Jesse has to deal with a voyeur who calls himself the Night Hawk and likes to look into the windows of women as they're undressing at night. His antics soon escalate into daytime breaking & entering, not to mention home invasion, and Jesse's worried that someone may eventually get hurt during the commission of the crime. Last, but not least, a young girl approaches Jesse to complain about her swinging parents and how it's hurting the family. Jesse doesn't have a problem with consenting adults swinging, if that's what they want to do, but when children are experiencing the negative side effects in this type of behavior, he feels the need to step in and do something about it before more emotional damage is caused.The story line and pacing of Night and Day are similar to the other books in the series, and the reader doesn't really encounter anything new here. The fun of the books, however, is in getting to visit with Jesse Stone for a few hours and to see how he's doing and to find out what's happening in Paradise, Massachusetts. The reader knows going into the story that Jesse will solve the crimes in one fashion or another, but it's Jesse himself that's the big attraction. He a good man, a tough man when necessary, but he still has problems like everybody else. As a reader and fan, I want to know how's he coping with his alcoholism and with the addiction to his ex-wife. Actually, I want to see him happy and at peace with himself, which leads to one very good thing about this particular novel--private investigator Sunny Randall is back (she and Jesse decide to give it another shot), plus her best friend, Spike, is opening a new restaurant in Paradise.As with most of Mr. Parker's books, Night and Day is well written with sharp, crisp dialogue that makes the reader want to try out some of the lines at work. And, like the TV movies, the novels basically follow the saga of Jesse Stone's life to see where he's at and how he's dealing with the day-to-day challenges. I think most readers can identify with the chief of police on many levels, be it problems with the person you love, or the need to drink in order to escape the stress of everyday life.Robert B. Parker's novels are always a delight to read and certainly entertaining in every sense of the word. Night and Day is no exception, and is a wonderful addition to an already marvelous series. I'll also add that older readers tend to enjoy Jesse Stone somewhat more than the younger ones, but Robert B. Parker does have a large fan base of all ages. Coming in May, the third novel in the \"Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch\" western series. Yeeeeehaaaa! Another winner in the \"Jesse Stone\" series!",

         "The Center of Everything : A Novel",
         "I am always looking for a good book to read, and I very rarely find one worth finishing. This book was quite the opposite; I wished it had gone on longer. It is a great book and I wish I heard about it more often, it deserves to be a best-seller. Excellent read This book was wonderful. I could feel the humid air and smell the lilacs with drops of water leftover, after a rainfall. I love the way Evelyn's thoughts are so black and white. It is or it isn't. I can't wait for another great story from Moriarty. You can smell the lilacs... Personally, I see little to compare between Laura Moriarty's The Center of Everything and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Both are fine books but Mockingbird centers on racism in the south years before the Civil Rights movement and this book is, in my opinion, a true coming of age novel.The protagonist, Evelyn Bucknow , was born out of wedlock to a mother who does her best for her daughter until depression overtakes her when she finds herself without a job and pregnant, but unmarried, a second time. Moriarty writes with such insight that you can't help but feel the child's pain, as well as the depths of the mother's despair. In fact, you can't help but feel FOR the mother even though her actions are responsible for their endless poverty. Because of an out-of-wedlock, teen pregnancy, the path was set--a path that young Evelyn has no choice but to live and survive.I hope I haven't led you to believe Evelyn's story is depressing because it isn't. Young Evelyn is smart! She is a thinker! I recommend the book to all ages but, especially to young readers, as it has a message that is straight and true: A single mistake can change your life, so use your head and learn from others. Outstanding! I liked the story and how the point of view of the narrator evolves as she grows and matures. The ending was a little drab, though. I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the characters futures. A good book but not too great of an ending I read this book in 2 days and loved every bit of it. It's definitely a must read!! I highly recommended this book to anyone. Awesome The book rec's was in good condition. Enjoyable....but I prefer non-fiction. Recommended to me by a friend. The Center of Everything Everyone is saying this has the distinct voice of To Kill a Mockingbird and it really is very similar. The story is not really like Mockingbird but the narrative perspective is told in the same way by Evelyn Bucknow. The book covers eight years of Evelyn's adolescence--from 10 years onto her graduation from high school. Her mother is constantly trying to make ends meet financially, and she loves Evelyn deeply. There is a great schism in the family because Tina, Evelyn's mother, had her out of wedlock. Tina's parents are extreme fundamentalists that will not let her forget her past. When Tina becomes pregnant again with a married man's baby, the problems start all over again, and Evelyn's grandmother, Eileen, is the only family that will talk to them.Evelyn's brother, Samuel, is born prematurely and it is soon obvious that he is mentally handicapped. Tina's role in the book changes to constant caretaker of Samuel, and Evelyn moves into her teenage years nearly alone. Her grandmother begins taking her to church, and Evelyn finds some answers there... yet she struggles with questions when one of her favorite teachers in school, Ms. Jenkins, becomes the target of a smear campaign by the fundamentalists for teaching evolution to the children. Evelyn's struggle to decide whether to side with her grandmother and the \"nice people at the church\" or her teacher shows exactly how Evelyn is certainly in the center of everything.The Center of Everything brings together many situations that Evelyn must confront--and she is a strong girl who has a very wise voice for someone so young. Evelyn as the center of everything... I wanted to love this book. I really did. It flows nicely and I connected with the characters. I found myself really caring about what happened to them, and I even teared up a time or two. The problem? NOTHING ever happened to them. I kept reading and reading, thinking something big was about to drop, and then it was just more-- nothing. There were a couple times in which it seemed like something might be about to happen, but nope. It's just a story about any old girl from nowhere, USA, who doesn't quite fit in and doesn't know quite who she is; most of us lived that, so why would we want to read it? Plus I HATED the ending. I get that the story will be continued in future books, but I'm not interested enough to spend the time and money to read any more. A Well-Written Story About Nothing I usually avoid books featuring child narrators like the plague, but when I recently picked up The Center of Everything, the writing was so winsome and Evelyn and her mother's precarious situation so compelling that I kept reading. And I'm so glad I did, because I got a lot more than I bargained for: The Center of Everything is a novel that I actively looked forward to returning to every night so I could see what the characters were up to, and toward the end I rationed out the pages so I could stay in Moriarty's Kerrville, Kansas a while longer. The character of Tina is a particular triumph; Moriarty gives her wit and warmth and shatters preconceptions about welfare mothers while remaining true to situation. Wise and compassionate and laugh-aloud funny, The Center of Everything is a book to be treasured and reread. Wonderful novel. sad not to be in Kerrville, Kansas anymore The Center of Everything is one of those rare coming of age novels full of emotional pathos and personal growth that somehow touches a deep nerve within, especially if you were about the same age in the Reagan era 80's as protagonist Evelyn Bucknow. It is a novel about a smart girl living in a small Kansas town with her overwhelmingly depressed, trampy \"welfare queen\" mother searching for a better path in life than the path her mother chose. Told from Evelyn's perspective between the ages of 10 through 18, the first half of the novel focuses on her increasingly strained relationship with her somewhat unattentive mother. When Evelyn reaches the breaking point with her mother and \"a black line\" is drawn between them, the novel then focuses on Evelyn's fractured friendships, painfully unrequited love and her desire to improve the quality of her life. Moriarty's prose is thoughtful and breezy with a touch of child-like innocence. The characters are achingly real keeping you riveted to the page not from suspense but from a desire to get to know them better. You'll find your emotions run high as you love/hate many of the characters, especially Evelyn's mother. Touching and poignant, sad but never sappy The Center of Everything is a believable account of a girl's search for herself and her place in the world. emotionally riveting This book ends with Evelyn standing on the porch with her special needs brother and a storm is approaching. What's that all about? Not worth the read...Very disappointed.. Ineresting Ending Everlyn Bucknow is a little girl with very little stability, but more than enough spunk to cope with her very roller coaster life. This book touched me very deeply. The terror of living so close to the edge of total poverty, that a mechanical problem with a car turns your entire world upside down. The unbelievable importance of caring and noticing teachers who can inspire a dream of a different way of life in a child. Send the kids to Grandmas for the weekend and lose yourself in this well written and inspiring book. Very Touching While interesting, the story was a bit predictable and I found it to be depressing at times. Would appeal to teens. Predictable It did keep my attention; However, very depressing and it just abruptly ended. I liked the main character, Evelyn. Would not have compared it to, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;. Depressing My two year old daughter accidentally bought this book and I think it is one of the best accident to happen as of late. Awesome Is there a sequel? The book was written well but at the end there was so much that was left hanging. The center of everything I very much enjoyed this book. It is a good indication of how someone that is born into poverty and faces many challenges is able to rise above it by the life choices she makes.I also had admiration for Tina, the mother. Her life choices were not good, but, she possessed a fierce love for her children.I especially admired the work she put in with her handicapped son.I would have given it five stars, but, the ending left me wanting more. Hopefully, a sequel will be written. The Center of Everything So, if you like your books to leave you depressed, this is a great one for you. The story follows Evelyn, the daughter of an unwed mother, from fourth grade until it stops without any apparent reason just prior to her graduation from high school. The ending makes no sense - it literally just stops without warning.The author has a good grasp on writing, which is why I have given her two stars instead of the one star the book probably deserved. The author dwells only on the negative and doesn't give us any glimpse of a good thing that might have happened to Evelyn during the eight years. Death, autism, teenage pregnancy, adultery, blah, blah, blah. Evelyn rises above it but without giving us any idea how she does so.Along the journey, the author snipes at conservative politics, Reagan, Oliver North, Christianity, and any other sort of morality. Hysterically, the author dwells on Iran Contra as if it consumed thought for eight years when reality is that it was a blip on the political scene that lasted only a short time. Strange and rather boring to read about in 2011. The only interesting thing I noted from this was that while the author was trying to beat Christianity to pieces, the only truly nice people in Evelyn's life, the ones that gave without expectation of any return, were the Christians.Apart from the author's political agenda and liberal ideology slapping you across the head over and over again, the abrupt ending is a horrible disservice to a reader who waded through the morass of it all, only to be stopped without satisfaction. Because of the ending, I cannot recommend the book. Unrelentingly Depressing I am so glad I finally read this book. I've had it laying around for the past couple years and never gave it much thought, but it turned out to be an excellent read.This is the story of Evelyn Bucknow. She lives in Kerrville, Kansas with her young mother and no father. We meet her at age 11 and follow her to her last year in high school. In that time she experiences her first love, and first heartache...the feeling of being an outsider, and the betrayal of her one true friend. She learns that young people do not in fact live forever, and she slowly realizes what she wants out of life, and how to acheive it.I highly recommend this book. Evelyn has such a voice for being so young, and her struggles through adolescence are at times both heartbreaking and joyous. I would really love to see a sequal to this book, to learn how Evelyn, her mother, her mentally retarded brother Samuel, and her beloved grandmother Eileen turn out. This was a great book, and I absolutely look forward to reading her future novels. Great Coming of Age Story... A good book for teenagers if they can see that one's actions determine one's consequences and that this isn't just another story. Evelyn's mother has made poor choices all her life, but even in her poor choices, she's found good. One good was Evelyn, the other was her handicapped child Samuel, the result of another poor choice. But Samuel may also be what saves the mother and leads her to begin to make good choices. Evelyn's grandfather made a very poor choice when he chose to label his daughter (Evelyn's mother) with harsh words, to be a poor father, and in essence turn his back on his child. His choice led Evelyn's mother to make the choices she made. One wonders what choices someone before him made which led to the choices he made. (He was not only an awful father, but an awful husband.) \"What happened to Eileen's mouth?\" Evelyn asked her mother. \"She married my father,\" her mother answers. I loved it when Evelyn's teacher planted that seed in Evelyn's head about choices. When the book ends we know, even though it's not stated and the book just sort of ends, that Evelyn will live her life better that her mother and the difference will be in her awareness of the consequences, both for good and for bad, in making choices. The Consequence of Choice I'd love to have a cup of coffee with the author, and compare notes on mothers. This book really touched me, and it's rare to find a book that can make me laugh as hard as it makes me cry. She has a wicked, clever style of narrative that kept me hooked the entire time. I'd love to have coffee with Laura M. I enjoyed getting to know these characters. Evelyn was a complex character with many of the same feelings and questions of most teenage girls. I loved being inside her thoughts and emotions then getting to understand her reasoning and thought process. I was disappointed that the book came to an end. I wish there was a sequel so I would know how they ended up. It was a little too abrupt of an ending. I also enjoyed going back to the 80's and reliving some of my teenage years. Uniquely written novel I enjoyed this book a great deal, although others I loaned it to, found it a tad depressing. It is during the same period of time I grew up, the 80's, but in a small rural town. It is a story of a flower growing out of weeds, a young girl growing up with a single mom whom makes bad choices but is still likable and kind. Very nice touching book. 80's Reagon Era Childhood Book I enjoyed this book, especially since I got it at such a bargain price. The character of Evelyn is very real, very familiar to anyone who was ever a teenage girl. I held back on the fifth star because of my confusion about her mother (is she crazy, is just selfish?) but the mother evolves as well, just as life does. The situations involving young love and broken hearts resonated as very true. I will read another book by this author for sure! I must comment that I love a marked down price in order to get familiar with an author! I think it is a marketing tool that is a win win! Satisfying read - most of the time This is a coming of age story about Evelyn, a young girl with a single mother. They live in Kansas and Evelyn is a lonely and bored young girl. The character development was interesting but the plot was not. I found it slow and very drawn out. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to finish and at the end it was a disapointment. Coming of age story that falls flat I bought this book because it looked fun and it was free. It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it. I don't even know why I finished this book... I thoroughly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud at times. Being a mother of girls and also a daughter myself, I could relate to both Evelyn and her mother. As the reader I found myself rooting for Evelyn and her mother..each likeable characters in their own way. The book covers the mother/daughter relationship from Eveyln as a preadolescent who adores her mom through the alienation and breaking away of the teenage years to a time just before Evelyn leaves for college and has gainedc respect and appreciation for her mother. I especially enjoyed the fact that this book held my interest without violence, excessive profanity or dark and depressing themes. A Fun Read Loved this snapshot of growing up in the 80's. The characters are all either judging or being judged as they deal with the consequences of their actions. Some scenarios are hilarious when viewed from Evelyn's perspective. Even better on the second read. Captivating I loved the writer's style, and thought she captured the personality of the main character and the thoughts, feelings, and nuances of her life at each age throughout the story.Religion was a strong thread throughout and while I would have been okay with that as an underlying issue, it was a bit too strong of a secondary storyline for my tastes. I found myself wanting to skim through some of those parts to get back to the \"good stuff.\"Overall, enjoyed the book. Great \"voice,\" a little too much religion for my taste",

         "After getting through the first 50 pages of the book it is very apparent that nobody proof-read this book before sending it to the presses. There are typos throughout the book. Run on sentences that were also a cause of confusion. Then to really put the nail in the coffin, there are missing steps in many of the excerises leaving the reader guessing how something was done. Horrible book ! Don't waste your money or your time on this one. Typos, Missing Steps and bad writing plague this title",

         "The Description & Setting volume for the Write Great Fiction series might not be the last word on these subjects, or the one book that has it all, but it provides a good overview and plenty of material for further reflection. Well worth the purchase price. WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE Like the other \"Write Great Fiction\" books, this one focuses on the elements listed on the title, description and setting. While the criticisms some others have had are sound, this is by no means a terrible book, and certainly it is not as awful as some would make it out to be. As for the criticism that there is \"nothing new\" in the book, that's easy. The author makes the assumption (as he should, seeing as how every other good author who has ever written a non-fiction work on any given subject would do the same) that the reader knows nothing, or little about how to write descriptive passages but wants to know more, so having \"no new information\" is an empty criticism. He isn't writing his book for people who already know the concepts, he is writing for those who don't know but want to learn them. The \"nothing is new\" criticism is like a math teacher being critical towards a new math book that comes out since it offers \"nothing new.\" Obviously the math teacher already knows the concepts that are covered in the math book.But I have spent more than enough time on that. This book will teach you how to describe aspects the reader can see, hear, feel, touch and smell, thus bringing them into the story. It will teach you how little description is too little, and how much is too much. It will teach you how to get the reader to paint a mental picture of the world you create in your story. It will teach you how to apply the other aspects of writing fiction, such as plot, dialogue and character development and how they relate to description. It will teach you how to create a single sentence that is chock full of information that the reader needs to know to understand the context of your story. That is what the author intended, that is what he does, and that is why this book is worth the money. Good book This is a practical and useful reference. Using examples from excellent writers, providing good tips for new approaches, it also gives exercises to develop techniques that make for better writing, authentic writing, more enjoyable writing. Handy for every writer's bookshelf I'm glad I bought this book. I definitely use it as a reference. I wish I'd bought it when I first started writing. Very good reference",

         "A Bride Most Begrudging",
         "I was not sure I would like this book, even after seeing the high reviews it received. I finally gave it a shot, and my only disappointment was that I waited so long to read it. I LOVED it, and finished the book in 3 days. I really liked the characters and various writing styles thoughout the book. It's a beautiful story and I hope it becomes a film one day soon! Loved this book Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature. Disappointing This was a pretty nice read. I really enjoyed the story line. If you are a romance enthusiast you will probably like this one. Pretty Good Read This is the first historical Christian romance I've ever read, and I absolutely loved it. Deeanne Gist is going to be a star, mark my words. Witty and charming, this is a story you won't forget. Lady Constance Morrow and Drew O'Connor are wonderful characters and before the book is over, you feel as if you've known them forever. Bravo, Deeanne, and thanks for a great read! Sparkling debut This book is awesome. I can't read it enough. The fact that they were forced to marry is just necessary for the story line, but the fact that they have some of the normal problems of a couple. Their reasons for these issues is that they won't communicate, & that they do it because they love each other. NEED TO READ MORE AGAIN & AGAIN I truely enjoyed this book. I found myself crying at times and laughing out loud at others. I really enjoyed the historic realness. This is not an easy book to put down and walk away from. Intreging, captivating, hard to put down. I do not like to read and I loved this book. Sometimes I had a hard time putting it down. It was clean, fun, and kept my interest. I am already on another book by that author. A Bride Most Begrudging I really enjoyed this book! Although it does carry a religious message, (probably because of the nature of this time period), I think it portrayed the struggles of the new American colonists very well. I liked way the romance fits in historically. I especially liked Constance as a character. I found the ending very abrupt. Awesome historical romance novel I picked this up, not knowing it was a Christian historical romance, but was not sure I'd enjoy it after reading some of the reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised, even though I knew how it would end well before the end.Constance is brought to Virginia after being kidnapped on the docks, and is sold to Drew, a planter who has lost his true love and wants nothing to do with the fiery Constance. When they are married to protect the morals of the area, it's in name only and Drew promises to help her get back to England, if her story checks out. As the book progresses, the couple has to figure out if their initial dislike can turn to attraction and maybe love.My biggest issue with this is that it's a story that's been done before. There aren't any twists to the story, nothing radical, it's just a pleasant reading experience. There isn't any sex; some of the prior reviews mention how much they lust after each other, and I kept waiting to see how \"scandalous\" the relationship would get, and there was barely any mention of them making love. But I just read \"50 Shades of Grey\" and maybe I'm sexed out, because I didn't mind the lack of racy dialogue in this book.It would be nice if the author would consider going back to revisit the characters in a future book. Josh, Drew's brother, was an interesting character, worthy of his own storyline, and their sisters, Nellie and Sally, would make for fun reads. Otherwise, this is a nice book to read to pass the time. Pleasant if predictable I didn't understand all of the rave reviews of this book. I found it to be very boring in places and drawn out. I understand that the author was trying to do all possible to make this book true to the time period she was writing about, however, much of the time the dialogue between the characters was hard to read..I didn't understand the reviews either that some were saying there was a lot of lust and offensive things in this book. There was nothing out of place in my opinion.I didn't hate this book, but I didn't overly enjoy it either. I would have quit reading it half way through if I didn't have to always finish what I start. If I would have just got this from the library, I would have deff quit reading it in the middle. Won't Read This One Again A very engaging story . . . I was most surprised due to the fact that this was not my favorite type/catagory of book but I was not able to put it down. Gist is an outstanding author who has created a real page turner. She does not drag it out but tugs at your heart til you find your eyes flying over the pages to see what happens next! I absolutely loved the personalities and the way she leads you through their own personal spiritual struggles and victories.... this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!! It will touch your heart and you won't be able to put it down!!!!!! I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end. A Christy winner? Really?????? American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century. America the soon-to-be Taken from her home in England against her will, Lady Constance Morrow is shipped to America, where she is to be sold to a Virginia colony farmer as a 'tobacco bride'. The daughter of an Earl, Constance is appalled by her humiliating circumstances. By an odd twist of fate, she ends up becoming the wife of Drew O'Conner, who had never intended to marry at all.Her position as a colony farmer's wife is very different from the life Constance had previously led. To Drew's increasing frustration, she has no skill with cooking and cleaning, and would rather solve mathematical equations than work. Tempers flare between both parties as they adjust to their new lifestyles. Nevertheless, though she began as a bride most begrudging, both Drew and Constance find their marriage of convenience turning into something more than either expected... She started as a bride 'most begrudging'... Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love. Superficial christian message. I will not be reading anymore of her books. I agree with another reviewer this is soft \"christian porn\". TMI I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I was waiting for this terrible \"lust\" to start...I didn't get it. First of all, they were married, and secondly they were married!! I don't think there is anything wrong with a man and woman being attracted to one another, especially if they are married!I never even figured out what these ladies were talking about, all I saw was an attraction, and not lust. Someone said that the characters just lusted after one another, and that there was no love...I think that the author showed the love grow...just like any marriage that starts off like theirs did, you will never have instant love, love is something that takes time. Physical attraction on the other hand can happen much sooner, which is what the author demonstrated.I really liked the book, it was easy to read. Someone else pointed out the historical inaccuracies, well that may be so, but I still enjoyed the book. I love the friction between the two main characters, it makes for an exciting and sometimes funny read! Good read! A true romance with out graphic sex! So cool. I thought it a wonderful story and fell in love with the characters! I liked the Christian over tones as well. I loved it and read it in two days. A lot cheesy at first..over all a great story!",

         "Manic Magee Diesel Hayes#8Manic Magee AKA: Jeffery Magee is a boy who lost his parents at age three years old. They died in a train crash. He ran away when he was only 7 years old. He went to live with his aunt and uncle but they always argued a lot. He wanted to live by himself but he was in the West End were the white kids were . All he wanted was to fit in with the black kids but he didn't have anyone to live with. So he made a new friend that provided a roof over his head.THE END Manic Magee Jerry Spinelli breaks down the stereotypes of what a \"traditional\" family should be in his novel Maniac Magee. Jeffrey Magee, (known as Maniac for some outlandish feats he performs) a strong-willed boy, uses his ingenuity to overcome adversity and find himself a home.Maniac is orphaned at three and moves in with his aunt and uncle who hate each other. Subsequently, they don't even talk to one another. After eight years of this non-existence, Maniac runs away from home. Maniac literally runs in search of a home. He becomes part of several families that he meets in the town of Two Mills. Suzanne Bunker says, \"We are not the Cleavers, we have single-families; step-families; adoptive and foster families; children raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles; gay and lesbian families; and individuals of all ages living together, unrelated biologically but still a family\" (116). The latter mirrors the situations in which Maniac finds himself. The first family with whom Maniac lives is the Beales. They are an African-American family living in the East End of Two Mills. They are a `traditional' family (mom, dad, big sister Amanda, little sister Hester and little brother Lester), and they welcome him into this family with open arms; his skin color is of no significance to the Beales. On his first night there, Maniac checks the front door of the house:number 728.Maniac has a home. He is part of a family. He loves the Beales and the East End and all the colors of the East End. \"He couldn't understand why they called themselves black ...he saw gingersnap and light fudge and dark fudge and acorn and butter rum and cinnamon and burnt orange. But they were never licorice which to him was real black\" (Spinelli 51). Unfortunately, because of his white skin, not everyone loves Maniac in the East End. Maniac feels that he has to leave his beloved Beales to protect them. He runs until he meets Grayson, a caretaker at the zoo. Grayson, an older man, takes Maniac in and gives him a home. As Suzanne Bunkers comments, this mirrors a grandparent raising the child (116). At Thanksgiving, Maniac prays, \"thank you for this warm house and our own little family\" (Spinelli 108). He goes outside and paints \"101\" on the front door, justifying their existence and their home. Sadly, Grayson dies, and once again Maniac is orphaned. Maniac runs again until he finds another family, the McNabs. This family, from the West End, consists of a drunken father and three neglected sons. Maniac feels that these children live like orphans. Maniac tries to instill right from wrong in the McNab children but wonders, \"how he could act as a father to these boys when he himself ached to be somebody's son?\" (155). This is not a good environment for Maniac. The McNabs are racist, and Maniac cannot live with them. He feels pride for the East End. He runs away from the McNabs to the zoo, until Amanda Beale comes to call him home. \"You are coming home...to sleep in your room...not here. This is not your home\"(183). Maniac is happy to go home. \"Children's literature is increasingly demonstrating that families cannot be so easily dichotomized as `traditional' or `non-traditional' and no one family is `normal', `typical', or representative of all families\" (Bunkers 128). Spinelli embraces these new types of families that mirror our culture in his novel and because of this, he is able to give a boy a home to call his own.Cited works: Spinelli,Jerry. Maniac Magee. Boston:Little, Brown and Company,1990. Bunkers, Suzanne. \"We Are Not The Cleavers\": Images of Non-traditional Families in Children's Literature\"The Lion and the Unicorn 16.1 (1992):115-133. Looking into non-traditional families This book is written by my favorite author - Jerry Spinelli. This book is so good that each time I read it, it gets more suspensful, fun, and there is more adventure each time. I would recommend this book to people who like suspense and action. If you like Harry Potter, you will love Maniac Magee. He's like Harry Potter, except he does it without magic. A magical book..... Since this book won the Newbery, I expected a good book. But it's mostly tells, not shows--a no-no for writers. The author tells just about everything. There aren't that many actual dialogue scenes between the characters. I didn't find this book interesting at all. Just because a book wins the Newbery doesn't mean it's going to be a winner. Surprisingly Uninteresting Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T. DarkBlade I wasn't such a &quot;Maniac&quot; Over this book Upon finishing Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli, I think I love it and dislike it all at the same time. Whenever I prepare to write a review on Amazon, I like to read as many previously written reviews as possible, just to gauge where everyone else stands with the novel. It seems as though the five star reviews loved this book because of the message and plot involved. Many of the one star reviewers, though, said the book was \"boring.\"Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing kids saying that \"I wouldn't have read this book if it weren't assigned in school.\" I dislike seeing kids being forced to read a certain book, because it may turn them off to further reading at a crucial age. Since this book has received the reputable Newbery Award some time ago, interest in it is higher than usual. However, as I said with Kira-Kira, PLEASE don't blindly assign children to read award winning books simply because they are on some list. Just because they have won these fantastic awards, doesn't mean they're for everybody.This book intends to tell the story of racial prejudice. Jerry Spinelli usually tackles some interesting issues in his stories, and Maniac Magee is no exception. The storyline itself is compelling and charming and some of the characters are very likeable, particularly Grayson, Amanda and her family. There were so many characters in this book though, that it was easy to get them mixed up.I know a few people who love the work of Jerry Spinelli and enthusiastically promote his work. As a result I decided to check out some of his novels. Spinelli writes in such a quirky way that one would find either off-putting or fantastic. I think I'm somewhere in between. While I love the fact that his novels are unique and unusual, I can see how children could find his writing difficult to read at times. He doesn't always flow smoothly and uses a very unusual style to describe something. He's not your typical author, that's for sure.This book is recommended for ages 8 through 12. Usually children like to read a book whose characters are older than they are. Spinelli's characters are usually rather young and would naturally attract a younger audience. However, the way that he writes may be too difficult for such a young audience. I was a bright kid, but honestly I think a lot of this novel would have gone over my head if I read it at age 8, simply because the reader has to read between the lines a great deal of the time with this book and my capabilities of doing that at age 8 were limited at best. If I know I would have struggled with it, I know there are other children out there who would do the same. This is not to say that ALL children would not understand this book, but there will be some. To Each Their Own Well, I am now a true fan of Spinelli's first I read Stargirl and now this wonderful tale. In a way he reminds me of John Steinbeck, both have this organic quality to their writing. You know these characters they are writing about aren't real, but at the same time you instantly feel like these are people you could look up from the page of your book and meet--the feel like people you already know. Which is amazing. Clearly Spinelli is in the right line of work.Maniac Magee has the same tall tale feel to it that Stargirl does. The world he plays in is a little bigger than hers, but both are loved and hated in very similar ways. He also refuses to see a persons faults and instead only focuses on their worth.Overall the book is sending a message about racisim, and how it really doesn't make sense, but there are other lessons througout the book. Which is really impressive because even for a book at this age level it isn't that long. Each chapter is only a few pages long which gives the reader the same feeling of running that Maniac Magee does throughout the entire book.No wonder school kids are always having to read this for some class or another. Its a book that tackles serious subjects but in a way that is not heavy handed and at times light hearted.Great great book!one last thought--ironic isn't it, how he is always running, like he's in a race and the book is about racisim? interesting play on words Spinelli does there. Very worthy of the Newberry I thought the book was boring. Maniac's parents died in a P and W trolley falling off a bridge because the driver was drunk.After Maniac heard the news,he stayed with his aunt and uncle.He ran away because his aunt and uncle annoyed him because they had seperate things and they never talk to each other.As he ran, he spoted the ball park.At the end,he realizes that life is not a game.This book made me think about running from problems. maniac magee I am using this book with my students. They seem to enjoy the book, and enjoy discussing Jeffery (Maniac). I feel that the characters are well developed which in turn brings out the problems with the two sides of the new town. We read a book dealing with prejudious and racism last year. Therefore, I felt using a book that was in the same vein, but taking a different tatic on the subject would also be good. I like a book that keeps the students interest. Also it makes it good for comprehension, and it will lead to some writing assignments as well. Maniac Magee Maniac Magee was an excellent book with a moral.Maniac's parents die from an accident, so Maniac is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Maniac decides to run away from the both of them, leaving Maniac homeless. In Maniac's city, all the black people were on the East Side and all the white people were on the West Side. Maniac goes and lives with new friend's that he meets, both on the East Side and on the West Side. No one is to onto the opposite \"Side\" unless that person works there. Blacks on one side, whites on the other. Maniac has many fantastic talents. He can run super, super fast, untie a know that measures over three blocks long when finally undone, and many others. The moral of this story is: don't judge people by their skin color.Maniac Magee is over all, a great book! I recommend this book to all ages! Maniac Magee is a Story With a Meaning This is what I thouthg of the book: it was so-so. This book was about a little boy who lst his parents when he was a little boy so when he found out he had to go live with his Aunt Dot and his Uncle Dan On is Aunt and Uncle did not get along because they had to do stuff seperley so Maniac ran away and lived with his friend and he made new friends.This book made me think of who it whould fill with out my mom and bad,and how it will fill if I had to live with Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan. So this is what i thouth of the book. Maniac Magee Although I've always been a fan of Jerry Spinelli's writing, this is definitely his best work. Warning: If you're looking for plot summary, read the standard amazon review, 'cause I don't want to repeat it.It's amazing how Spinelli has managed to take an issue as touchy as racial prejudice and managed to present it in a way that is not only understandable, but very realistic...Spinelli writes with a style that not only tells the story of a poor orphaned kid with famous - nay, legendary - abilities, but also provokes thought on many other issues, including racism, death, seperation, and many other scary but real issues in the lives of America's youth.I've read this book numerous times over the course of my life, and as I've gotten older (6 years or so have passed since I first read it), I still appreciate the message and story told by this book. Powerful...for people of many ages. My whole family (2 grown ups and a twelve year old) enjoyed this one. A really good story, one you don't want to put down. Best of all, it is infused with a message of tolerance that doesn't preach. Perfect for 5th and 6th graders. terrific book As a kid, this book drew me in quickly. It is fast paced and fun, and \"Maniac\" lives the life every little boy wishes he could. But to read the whole novel is not to want to stay young... Jeffrey learns about responsibility, and maturity, and how to love the unloveable. The book teaches us that home is a place of love and healing and growth, not a place where people look similar. I fell in love with this book in third grade, but it might be a bit more suitable for the 5th-7th grade level, or a fairly advanced reader of a younger age. A book for boys who want to be men Maniac Magee is a wonderful book. It was great, Once I started reading it I was hooked for the rest of the book. I liked how Maniac even though he was small he could do things that other bigger kids didn't. It gave a chance for the short people to be better than everybody else at something. It is about a boy orphand when he was only three years old. He is sent to live with his closest relatives. He can't stand them. His relatives argued a lot and stopped talking to each other. He Loves to run, he better at things than any other kid and he prooves it. It shows that even thought he is good at everything he has feelings too. I really liked it, I will tell everybody I know to read this book. It is intended for mainly teenagers. Maniac Magee From the Beales to Earl Grayson. This kid is a legend. Maniac in my point of view is he is a kind-hearted kid, who always takes your breath away. I wish the story never had to end. I also take Maniac as a diamond in the rough. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do. I gave this wonderful story a five star rating. Thank you for your time.- Secret Reader Praise for the legend 'Maniac Magee' I think the book Maniac Magee is a great book by Jerry Spinell. He really explained alot of things in detail. It is a very funny and exciting book! I really liked the wayManaic Magee wasn't scared of anyone and he could make friends with anyone. My favorite part was when Manaic hit the frog fling home run. I think that the way people were willing to help manaic out and be there for him shows the good side of our world. Amanda was a great charctor because she was helpful in everyway. I know that this book shows how people can help each other and how the blacks and whites can work together. I would recommend this book to any one that might have probles with different colored skin that can understand how to work there prprobles out. Or to just a young teen that is looking for a good book to read. I know I love this bookbecause I have read it more than once and I hope you will too. This book is great! The character in this story is Maniac Magee, but his name isn't really Maniac Magee. when he was born, he was known as Jeffrey Lionel Magee. His parnets died nad that's when his life changed and so did his name.the best known thing that Maniac or \"Jeffrey \" Magee is known for is for what he did for the kids from the east side and those from the west side. But there still a puzzeling question. Whyndid he help those kids and why was he near those areas. If you want to find out more go to your local libary and check it out. You'll never know what will surprise you. CRAZY MAN",

         "The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))",
         "It is very easy to see why this novel is a classic, i do not know about other people conclusions but for me it shows simply that our own mind is a very hard judge for us, humans; and that our natural behavior hardly ever gonna live up to our mind expectations. A Classic This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde. It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \"wanted\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could. God and the Devil The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! Great story with amazing insights. If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process. No movie can match the beauty of the original book Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt. Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book. You are supposed to hate most of the characters. Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards. This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant. Cheers Short and... well not sweet The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust. A story that is as relevant today as when it was written arrived in good shape; classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time. classic The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull. This book makes for a good read. :) Great condition Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain. relax Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\"The picture of Dorian Gray\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work. \"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter\"-Oscar Wilde This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \"successful\". With this Annotated and Uncensored Edition of Wilde's book, we have its history and definitive text. The Contents:General IntroductionTextual IntroductionTHE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYTextual NotesAppendix A: Accidental Changes Introduced into the Text by J. M. Stoddart or His AssociatesAppendix B: The 1891 Preface to THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAYNotes of Wilde EditionsFurther ReadingThe annotations are in-depth, fascinating and informative, reflecting the era in which the novel was spawned, aspects of Wilde's biography, &c.; Illustrations are plentiful and superb, with many in color, illustrations from the book, photographs of Oscar Wilde and his chums and lovers and enemies, various pictorial representations of the book's title character, and many of Aubrey Beardsley's irreverent illustration for SALOME.I enjoy the novel as a novel. It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition. Wonderful In Every Way I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner. A true classic with beautiful prose Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path. Reflecting On Morality Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read. Merits a second read... It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic. Book Before Movie loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth Brilliant! I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! WELL WORTH BUYING This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot.I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?\" he asked, looking at her across the table. \"A great many, I fear,\" she cried. \"Then commit them over again,\" he said gravely. \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\" Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.Punctuality is the thief of time.Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure.You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.Anybody can be good in the country.To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Oscar Wilde knew something about human nature. Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! Great Read I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Oscars wit runs Wilde This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. Beware The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing. A tale of corruption and a cynic man are the eesence of the story that has captivated generations. Read it. One of the best When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an `immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a `spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray. Masterpiece that was written ahead of its time It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \"expressing,\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \"let it all hang out.\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \"as easy and graceful as ever.\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \"the end of the century\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO- When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" The Picture of Dorian Grayby Oscar WildeOriginally Published in 1890.Grade: B+Roughly, this novel can be cataloged as a \"Transgressional Fiction.\" A main character, Dorian Gray, leads a hedonistic life, believing that a life serving senses and beauty is the most ideal way to lead one. The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that `Ugliness is the only reality.'\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that `All art is quite useless\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled `useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \"All art is quite useless,\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called `Aesthetic Movement,\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\"\"`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\"\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\"\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"To define is to limit.\"\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\"\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth. Sin and Art in our lives Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many. Better the First Time The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. Gothic Classic I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read. A cautionary tale I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Oscars wit runs Wilde Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side. Jekyll and Hyde (Mostly Hyde) Without the Potion This book is a classic for a reason, and this particular edition is excellent because there are notes and explanations as well as discussions of the trials of Wilde for indecency. I found it fascinating and thought-provoking. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially those interested in historical cultures. A classic look at the themes of vanity, influence and the corruption of the soul. One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in `The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age. A tale of pleasures without consequence The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \"preaches\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people. Review for Dorian Grey The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \"portrait\" in our minds as well. Suspenseful Page Turner But A Little Lengthy I knew the story and had seen the films but never read the book. Worth while read of a classic. Good Book I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \"off the rails\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book. Interesting Dorian Gray realizes in the winter of his life that he has been deceived by hedonistic philosophies of Lord Henry and thereafter he succumbs to the depravity of his lifestyle. The unadulterated pursuit of pleasure leaves every man desperately empty. Oh that Dorian would have sought the Lord Jesus who will remake a man despite his past. Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow. This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. Fantastic, haunting The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece. Good, Not Great Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. . A book everyone should read The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. Vanity This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \"curse\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time. Haunting tale told beautifully. The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" To Gain the Whole World, but Lose the Soul The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \"must-read.\" Timeless Quest for Youth and Beauty with a Twist this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words Great story, imformative notes Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short. An interesting read... The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. Simple Message, Great Story I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy The Picture of Dorian Gray My mother had recommended this book to me awhile ago, saying though she'd never read it, I'd probably like it. I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson The Picture of Dorian Gray I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \"Importance of Being Earnest.\" And his \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away! Wilde Nearly Redefines Literature There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading. A This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. The story of Every Person I had heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, I knew what it was about, but I never imagined it was going to be such a good book. At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \"revealing\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far. My own experience reading The Picture Of Dorian Gray I have read this book in my AP English class in high school and this is be far on my top 5 favorite books and an easy read. Classic What can you say? This book was as good when I read it this time as it was when I read it twenty years ago. Oscar has it going on with this one. Timeless classic The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. A philosophical inquest into deleterious effects of sinful and vulgar living One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing. A Classic This is a great classical novel. I enjoyed it very much and I am certainly looking forward to keep reading Wilde's works. Great novel Excellent book! A classic. I read this in high school and did not pay to close attention to the details and the wisdom surrounding this story, but now that I have lived a few more years it makes so much more sense.... great book This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\" A favorite Oscar Wilde never disappoints. His plays are amazing & so is his only novel, \"The picture of dorian gray\". This is one of my favorite classics novels. Wilde's vivid details captured my intrest from the very first page. The characters were well developed, the ending was great. Overall, this is a must read book! It has everything from suspense, romance, drama, to art. I would definitely have to read it again sometime. Maybe it'll be the first book I ever re-read. Beauty is only skin deep Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite. Oscar Wilde Was One Of The Best. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy! dorian gray is a 1700's soap opera :) Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. Picture of Dorian Gray I thought it was good, I don't know why people are saying it was boring. good Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think. Exquisite Literature I have read the book and realy enjoyed it. I also have the DVD of it. You realy must get both. Picture of Dorian Gray I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) Great, Great Read! As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one. Glad to have read this classic Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye! Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided. Platter of Amorality The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. Cavalier and irreverent statement on life and society, To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up. A timeless treasure This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out. Very Interesting Look into Human Nature While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \"phew\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic. A classic. Thought provoking for each of us. I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral! Excellent Book, boring book, genial book... Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book. Who wants to look young forever? Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. Boring How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! Awesome title Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \"tragic ending\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be. Wonderful As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic. Hello? The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities. The writing style was absolutely maddening!The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \"classic\")After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore. Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying. Bottom line: Boooooooooooooring! What a SNOOZE!!!!! First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Very Good Story but Deep Wow...I had been under the impression prior to reading the novel that this was one of the great works of Western Literature in the past 200 or so years...Never have I been so dissapointed. While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf... Greatly Overrated... Wilde gives us fabulous quotes and a delicious hedonistic storyline, with as always a sence of humor - pleasure to read. Flamboyant Wilde The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. Picture of Dorian Gray definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good interesting. One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing.

Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" Excellent read of classic literature.

I truly great read and a classic that has stood the test of time. Incredible book The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator. A fine example of Wildean Wit. Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading. Be careful what you wish for Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall. Good read I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' A Classic Story.... I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \"Penguin\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \"Pocket Book\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \"Japanese effect\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap. Pick this Kindle Edition, not the Free one I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read! One of my favorites I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read. A Thrilling Read Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through... Great book, ruined by copy cats! Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also. Dorian Gray: a Novel That Outlasts It's Age... This was a great book chalk full of meaning. I liked how Dorian had both good and bad influences about him, yet he succumbed to one and destroyed the other. God and the devil This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. Beware The novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life. Possibly not the easiest read, but... I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young. could this be love? This book is simply amazing. It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read. Great book This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book The Picture of Dorian Gray The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. An interesting story I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave. Disregard the rating. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. Glad to be finished writing a research paper about this book What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of `relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self The life of Mr. Gray loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth Brilliant! The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of those stories that your supposed to and not supposed to read at the same time. You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting. As pretty as a picture...and just as revealing. All the great reviews speak for themself! It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book! What can I say that hasn't already been said? This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate. delightful conjectures I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point. Love to read Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading. A bit of a high horse for Wilde. Wonderful book; vanity is a terrible thing. Read this book, the classics are worth reading especially when you don't have to. The picture of Dorian Gray The preface is missing which is a critical to the book! Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise! Where is the famous preface? Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended. Wilde's Only Novel is Delightful I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift. Another edition of the timeless book When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Nice book and really nothing more Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic Classic and amazing. I have read this about three times already and still enjoy every minute of it although the hints of homosexuality kind of through me off. Fantastic. This free classic version for my Kindle was very good! It's the first Oscar Wilde tale I have read and I found it to be reader-friendly, engrossing and surprising at the end. Picture of Dorian Gray Rich characters, nice flow and if you don't know anything about the story I think you'll be having a hard time putting this one down. I've heard the name of topic brought up enough in life to recognize the title but was blessed with no spoilers being laid out and I was surprised at how engrossed I was with this read. I usually am weary about picking up classics because i don't like to get lost in the language but Mr. Wilde is clear and concise in his descriptions and His characters were very personable and interesting.I say READ IT! READ IT NOW! What a Wilde book This was so intersting you do not want want to put down, very much a book you can get lost into Saw this as a movie years ago Beyond just the text, this edition gives a wonderful overview into the full cultural context of Oscar Wilde's original work, and all the influences that resulted in its changes. Fascinating and informative First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. Glad to be finished writing a research paper about this book The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. Simple Message, Great Story The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \"yearly re-read\" shelf for certain. Review of The Picture of Dorian Gray First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. Timeless classic? I hardly think so. Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. poisonous by beauty A book for all time. This is a piece we could all use to search the places in our souls that need careful review and study. Probably Oscar Wilde's greatest work that continues to live on. Timeless message Oscar Wilde's only novel is, in my opinion, his greatest work. While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be. A Victorian tale for our time The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. An interesting story \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \"musings\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read. My First Wilde What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned. An excellent story This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...) Dorian Gray The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail fortwo years. He left England and moved to France where he died at avery young age. What a loss? mind over matter I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought. Masterful It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT. The Picture of Dorian Gray The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel. Not really that good..... It is a tale of moral decadence and debauchery. Dorian seems consumed in his self portarit, his love for himself is so big that he cannot see beyond his image and when his true image dawns on him he dies. However i did not give him five stars because of the way the plot moves. It is a little bit slow and only at the end you feel it taking full force. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com a tale of moral decadence I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? Beauty is only skin deep In the course of his career Oscar Wilde, an Irish writer and poet known for his epigrams and more notably as one of the most popular playwrights in London in the late 1800's, wrote only one solitary novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \"beauty for beauty's sake\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy. The Picture of Dorian Gray: Oscar Wilde evaluation This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else. Intense and Dark (3 1/2 stars) While the plot and subplots take many twists and turns, they are easy to follow. The uncanny &#34;ability&#34; of the portrait is very intriguing. Watch the movie after reading the novel. Superb",

         "I found Process Mastering to be a very valuable resource. The book is well written and straight forward in describing how to develop a process master.In my field of information technology (IT), it is critical for progam designers to have a baseline of how a program presently works. This is best done by a representative team of end users. I have found process mastering the most economical and efficient way to get a document that describes the current system. By doing a process master the team becomes empowered to improve the present process without the IT people and to know what else they want or need IT to do for them. Additionally, the team becomes more effective in their participation in the joint application development (JAD) with the IT folks.The philosophy behind the approach is very empowering to employees since it is they, the people who do the work, who develop the process masters. I am also pleased with the emphasis that the book puts on understanding the needs of internal and external customers.Finally, I can recommend this book to anyone who has processes they want to improve and who sees the value of engaging the energy, thought and commitment of their employees to do it. This book, this process, is truly liberating even to the extent of giving meaning and value to previously mundane work. A Practical empowering way to document a process",

         "From Russia, With Love",
         "Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are certainly not the mixed bag that the films are, but some are certainly better than others. From Russia with Love is, along with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, among the best.From Russia with Love starts off on a different foot than most of the other Bond novels. Bond himself doesn't appear until part two, 95 pages into the story. Until then, the story centers on the deadly operatives of SMERSH, Soviet Russia's spy-killing organization. It's this first part that sets up the main plot of the story--a Russian scheme not only to assassinate James Bond, but to do so in a way that will scandalize the English public and shame the Secret Service. One of the more famous Bond girls, young Tatiana Romanova is suckered into posing as \"bait\" for Bond, and unbeknownst to her, both she and Bond are set up to die at the hands of Irish psychopath Red Grant.With those pieces in place, the plot proceeds methodically from point A to point B. Fleming was never a master plotter, but that's not the point. Having all the parts set up and ready for action generates enormous suspense--when, for instance, is the serial-killing Grant going to make his inevitable and violent appearance? Even for those who have seen the film version, there's plenty here to surprise and lots of white-knuckle thriller chases, fights, bombings, and near-misses.The book does have flaws. Bond is a bit too obtuse and more of a pawn than usual, and Tania is just a bit too wide-eyed and innocent, which I suppose is the point. But the book moves so briskly from the opening setup through the building suspense and action that one hardly has time to criticize the characters--the world is moving just as fast for them.From Russia with Love is one of Fleming's best not only because of his signature pace and action, but because, in this novel, he takes the time to develop menacing villains and show us, before Bond ever steps onstage, just how dangerous they are. The androgynous Rosa Klebb and giant, moon-crazed Red Grant are well-developed and certainly among the best of Bond villains.On a final note, upon reading this novel have Doctor No, the book's immediate sequel, on hand, because Fleming's ending is so abrupt and laden with ambiguity that you'll want to jump right into the next book. This is either a weakness or a strength. I'll go with strength.Highly recommended. One of the best Bond novels As I watched the last 007 movie I couldn't help but want more....quick read now I want more James Bond. Loved it! Fully one-half of the way through \"From Russia With Love\", by Ian Fleming, the reader awaits the first action scene - related to the main theme of the book, the nasty spy intrigues and assassinations of the Cold War. How \"007\" and Fleming got their images and reputations from this book is beyond me.Yes, during the first half of the book there is a brilliantly executed build-up, a plenitude (too much perhaps?) of minute detail (especially the faces of the characters), and promises or hints of something more (hopefully some action or intrigue) to come.The classic, 1950's-1960's settings in Moscow, London & Istanbul are fun to read. Since I visited each of those cities in the very early 1960's, I was amused and pleased at the accurate depictions.As Bond and the fem fatale Tanya depart Istanbul on the Orient Express, the pace picks up, thankfully. Actually for the first 80% of the story, the hero and main character is MI5's Istanbul officer Kerim, a Turk. Up to that point, Bond is a minor character, strangely nave, notably uncertain, and only an eager, bumbling follower.For the most part, except for many oft-repeated pet phrases, it's well-written, this story. Bond improved in the last 20% of the story, becoming somewhat the \"Bond, James Bond\" we know from all those movies. It is possible that the movies (which we have all seen at least 4 times) gave us a truly false picture of 007?All-in-all, Bond, as a cold war spy, disappoints through almost all of the story as a mistake-prone, super nave, very gullible and ineffective officer the realm. One must endure the book for the denouement scene on the train. The final few pages are almost laughable and quite unsatisfying.I give it a weak 3.00 on Amazon's scale, if only out of respect for Fleming's body of work and as a thank you for creating the character of James Bond. But make no mistake, \"From Russia with Love\" is wholly disappointing. James Bond Is a Nave, Gullible Boob This is the first Bond book that I have read, and I have to say that it wasn't a very good first impression.Bond spends the majority of the book. He is talked about, and he watches the action happen around him. Towards the end of the book he finally becomes somewhat active, however he misses every clue that he is given. WHen the bad guy finally makes an appearence - after sooo much was told about him at the start of the book, his entire history - he only spends a short amount of time in the action of the book. He reveals the entire plan to Bond, and then is of course killed by Bond. Not because Bond is super cool, but because Bond is super lucky.Of course the woman, the \"heroine\" spends the entire book either making love to Bond or sleeping, but I never expected anything more.Overall, I'm not sure what the appeal of Bond is, but maybe as a friend suggested, I picked the worst one out of the Bond books. I find nothing wrong with formulaic spy books, but this was bad. Readable Oh yes, those beautiful Russian girls and their decoders can really tie you into knots. Isn't that right Mr. James Bond? Get the Lecter and the girl, but at what price? From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight. A Veeerrrrryyy interesting ending Fleming does a great job introducing us to all of the characters in this novel. Like the movie this novel allows us to see Bond as a secret agent, not a superman saving the world. A must read for all Bond Movie fans. One of the best five Bond novels This is one of my favorite James Bond books. I read it as a child and I recently repurchased it for the Kindle to reread it. I still own all of the original paperback books but they are so fragile that I am afraid to read them as I fear they may come unbound.I liked this book a lot because of the detailed plot by SMERSH and their plans to entrap Bond and kill him. The assassin is a master killer with a devious and detailed plan to complete his mission. I won't ruin the story for you but you probably already know it from reading the book before or watching the movie.I think that Ian Fleming was at his best writing when he wrote this book. I feel that in his mind the Bond character was fully developed as well as the hated of the Russians for Bond who always seemed to be able to thwart their devious plans with his skills. This story is solid and well written with love, romance, murder, trickery and suspense in it. I truly enjoyed this story and it is one of my favorites. If you are a James Bond and Ian Fleming fan then this is a must read for you. Even the ending is dramatic! SMERSH has decided that Bond must be killed and British secret service embarrassed! From Russia, with Love has a great plot and is well written. Fleming has a great way of portraying his characters. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I read it twice.

         "Jane Eyre (New Windmill)",
         "Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \"fairy tale\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \"blindness\" in the novel. First, he is \"blind\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \"plain\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \"stuck in the mud\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic. Jane Eyre is a strong protagonist, but this book should be read later in life This was fun as a romance novel, without the really steamy parts! It is always interesting to read books that were written before electricity. Romance in the 1840's The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies. Love this book! This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics. Wonderful Book I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!! Loved it Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though. Jane&iexcl;s courage, self-respect and independent helps her towards to her life and overcome all the difficulties, finally obtain her life and her true love. hero in my heart I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down even for a second.I loved the writing style and the depth of the characters. Amazing I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \"mad wife in the attic\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \"hero\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \"Jane Eyre\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind Re-thinking Mr. Rochester Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\"Jane Eyre\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester. One of the Great Romances This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist. Beautifully Written This book surprised me not having pages long descriptions of nature and place, which I like. The story is exciting, eventful and sends a great message about love, respect and God. I really enjoyed it... also because it is written in beautiful old English. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. One of the best love stories horrible book specially bcuz the language was weird. i remcommend this book to old fashioned people. la la la la umm Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel. (...) Depth unimagined This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (\"manly\" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The \"I heard your voice in the wind\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century! Better than I expected Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!! The Greatest Romance Ever Written!!! it is true that many would consider the language in here outdated. I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts. Classic i had no problems with my order and it was delivered very quickly. thank you. i will be looking here first when i need to order books next semester fast delivery This was an adorable little book that was very affordable. I loved the look and antique feel. The book mark was also a nice touch. cute little book I read this book years ago and wanted to read it again. I couldn't remember much about the story. I really enjoyed it, even though some of the language of that time was hard to follow at times. Jane Eyre I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \"classic\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \"quick read\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there. Although I would consider Jane Eyre herself plain I definitely would not consider this novel that. Anything but a Plain 'Jane' Book This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \"Amphigorey,\" among others. There weren't so many as to be distracting; only enough to make you anticipate one as the story reached an important turning point. Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a bit of contemporary art with their classic lit. Brilliant illustrations Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read. I chose the book for a school project and was honestly not expecting to enjoy the read. I was pleasantly surprised to find a book that was relatable and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down. No well-read person should miss out on this classic. A Fabulous Novel Completely has no detectable flaws in my point of view. Totally seems like the writer is a great writer. :) Awesome book I had always wanted to read this after seeing the old movie from before I was born (I'm 59). It tells so much more of Jane Eyre's life a as a young girl. A Favorite It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years. Great book Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style. Jane Eyre This book misrepresents itself. We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \"Peek inside\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear. Choose a different version of this classic I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \"coincidences\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey. mixed feelings... Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature. A 19th century masterpiece Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book. My opinion on Pride and Prejudice Enjoyed this book so much. Very readable and engaging.It may have been written long ago, but is still enjoyable. A great read. I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud. How on earth can anyone find Jane Eyre boring?? I have always wanted to read the classics. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel. Classics Although this book's words are quite hard to understand, the plot of this story is amazing. I am only 13 years old but I enjoyed this book loads. I recommend it!!!!!!!!! Hard, but good I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . . hasn't held up well for me I absolutely loved this book. Jane's character is one that you just keep pulling for because you genuinely care what happens to her. She has a strong will and is the type of protagonist that I find inspiring. Although this is by no means a quick, light read I think that if you're a fan of the classics this is one that you need to add to your \"must read\" list. I look forward to rereading it!

Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \"Jane Eyre\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story. This is my favorite book. Exciting Gothic story The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque. What a piece of crap I've read it 4 times and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Always want to change what happens...and always imagine a healed Mr. Rochester. Review of Jane Eyre by Bronte Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \"Reader, I married him\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.' Greater than its reputation I'd been wanting to read Jane Eyre for quite some time. I even had a copy in my possession. The problem was that it was a boring edition. I couldn't get into it.All that changed when I saw this illustrated version on a shelf. The feel was amazing; the pages, the illustrations, the text-- everything came to life.I definitely recommend this edition to any Jane Eyre fans or those simply wishing for livelier way to enjoy this novel. I'm hoping she does more illustrated editions in the future. Dame Darcy brings this classic to life Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \"syrupy-ness\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while. this is what a romance should be... Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \"passionate\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \"coincidences\" which might have been classed as \"providence\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \"coincidences\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop. Love it, but the writing is a bit dull at times I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte. Lovedddddd it! I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, `Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes. A treasure This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over. I love this book! Definitely a keeper. Jane Eyre has been my favorite novel since I was 12 years old and every single time I read it again it just gets better and better. If you like reading good mysteries, biographies, and romance than Jane Eyre is your book. Charlotte Bronte spectacularly captures the emotions and feelings of the characters and creates a strong and independent lead.It's just wonderful, amazing, and the best book I've ever read.What are you doing reading this... you should have downloaded Jane Eyre and started reading it already. This Novel deserves 10 stars! I bought this book because I was interested in the author after being compared with her in my own writing. first person is not the way I write, but Charlotte Bronte did a great job and the book is a good read. Interested in this author. I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience! &quot;Poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;...and amazing I read this book as a teenager and enjoyed it. As an adult I love it.If you like historical romantic fiction you will enjoy Jane Eyre. I was captivated JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\" Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte This is a classic love story that you can't go wrong with. Classic! Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts. Jane Eyre: A Refreshing Love Story In many ways, `Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of `good' over `evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote `Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith An unconventional heroine Jane Eyre is a great classic novel. It was a pleasure to re-read it after many years.Would highly recommend. A great classic novel. 4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \"The Eyre Affair\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :) really 4.5 stars I did not realize the \"collector's library\" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read. Too small I have only seen the movie and I find much to my delight that th book far surpasses Hollywood's version. I can not believe that I never even considered taking the time. Now I intend to read as many of the classics as I can. After many years I finally read JANE EYRE Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius! STUNNING, MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful. A Rebel in Literature The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!! The freedom of finding true love I first read this in college, and didn't fully appreciate it at the time. But I have since read it several other times, and it has become a treasured favorite. Even better upon re-reading An old classic that I had largely forgotten. I enjoy the words that are no longer used and the chance with the kindle to look up definitions easily. Jane Eyre I read Wuthering Heights in high school and loved it, but never read any more of the Bronte sisters. Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \"busy\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!! I can't believe i waited so long I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story. Awesome Book I am 14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre). My favorite book! all the review's here say \"ooo u can't appreciate this as a teenager\". u know what??? i'm a YOUNG teen, and i can appreciate the romance in this story. the only thing is... idk it's heart wrenching in some parts but other parts its just... boring! i was forced to read this for a book report. whoever thinks we don't understand the romance then ur wrong because today's teenagers grow up quickly what w/ all the media and etc. we do understand. we might not take it as seriously but we do understand it. don't diss us and say this book is too difficult for us. my teacher would not have recommended this it us if she thought we were too ignorant to understand it. i'm thirteen This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too. A job well done My emotions were all of the place with this book. I consisted of well placed imagery and overall events. I believe I actually cried a few times, especially towards the end. I'm can truly and honestly say that I loved this book and I'm glad I had to read it for my AP English class. Unexpected Love Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book. Meaningless You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status. Do not miss out on this book... How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book. My favorite piece of literature This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre. true romance? I had to read this for English and its my new favorite high school book. I highly suggest it, mainly for girls. Love story Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \"Jane Eyre\" doesn't come close to \"Wuthering Heights,\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written. A Brit Lit classic &#34;I am a free person...&#34; I love this book. This had not been the first time I had read the book but definately different especially since it was the first time that I read it in digital format for the first time. Through this book I found out that I like the digital format; definitely not better than paper but nice on the train. Jane Eyre I bought this book to try to relate to old classic books but it was boring and I didn't even finish it. But that is just me and I don't like these types of books, but it was free, and you might like it, so it can't hurt. Eh brave jane, my favorite of the first person heroines. not a beauty - thank god, isnt that a relief! - but plain and puny and with an indomitable spirit. she chooses morality, in a line which i cant forget: \"and there i plant my foot.\" For rules are not made for when times are easy, or to be discarded when they are inconvenient, but are there as a lifesaver for when emotions and life are in disarray. read it over and over Great book, a real page turner. After reading many of Jane Austens novels I was told to try the Bronte sisters and it was definitely worth it!! Wow! This classic is witty and thought provoking. The plot is twisty enough to entertain the most experienced reader; you may guess the ending but not the path to it. Jane Eyre Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition, A timeless Classic in the English Canon Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \"Wuthereing Heights\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read. Woman of Great Importance first read Jane Eyre when I was fifteen. It was such a wonderful joy to my then teenage mind full of dreams of love one day.Rereading it every now and then it takes on new understanding each timeThe language would be difficult for teens today (no lol or texting talk!!) But I hope some will try-it is a very good storyAll in all I loved it all over again!! Romance revisited and absolutely enjoyable! This is my favorite love story ever and it's the third time I've read it. As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids. My favorite love story ever! I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story. great classic love story Got it to give as a valentines gift, but ended up keeping it! Very beautiful. Classic Jane Eyre When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again. Jane Eyre I loved Jayne Eyre as a young girl and read it many times but had not tried it as an adult. It turned out to be just as captivating for me now as it was then. One of the greatest classics Loved the insights in Charlotte's writing. It was such a pleasure to read and I was sad when I came to the end but not sad about the way it ended. Classic Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it. Review of Jane Eyre A true classic! Well worth the read. If you are tired of modern novels with too much sex and violence try reading the classics Jane Eyre is a great place to start. Jane Eyre - A great read Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties. Pride and Prejudice: A Classic Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults. Read it while you are young! This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre. Great Gothic Romance I love Barnes and Nobles Classics books. The quality of these books are very nice. I will continue to buy them. Love I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males. A Classic Gothic Novel Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like. Jane Eyre It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre I have been passionate about Jane Eyre for going on twenty years now. It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \"martyrdom\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever. One of the very best The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back. The book never came I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \"classics,\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name) The classic I'm always happy to read It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then. Jane Eyre For all you out there who aren't very big fans of classical literature, I assure you that this book will not disappoint. This is a beautiful love story that isn't too hard to understand as far as classic books go, and is well worth the effort. A guaranteed good read I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not. Timeless Tale I am 41 years old and have read this book four times, about once a decade. An absolute must read for anyone who loves serious reading, and sorry, Jane Austen, but Charlotte Bronte rocks the house in ways you never could! A Raging River i normally dont go for the books that take alot of thinking but this book is now one of my favorites. it is a perfect combination of romance and mystery. for sure a great read i highly recomend! woderful book Have wanted to read Jane Eyre for a long time. Have found the novel worth the time as well as in the populist and feminist perspectives. Jane Eyre timeliness Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99. Though this makes skipping back easy when your listening to it in the car, it might reek havoc on your MP3 player. The box is thin cardboard, and the CD's come in thin paper sleeves. Well performed reading of a Gothic classic If you haven't read it, you're in for a quiet explosion. Just think about when Bronte wrote this and wonder where...WHERE...in the world did this woman get all of her insight? I cannot recommend this enough. Every time I read this treasure, I learn more I have several copies of this novel & it's one of my favorites of all time. I will read & re-read always. One of my favorites! \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \"Gone with the Wind\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \"Wuthering Heights\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light* \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\" I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story! Jane Eyre Still on Top I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures... A wonderful surprise I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest. Great Classic I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly. A classic This is my all time favorite read!

The story has so many twists and turns and is so well told. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I read it on my phone and appreciate being able to read the Kindle version free. Wonderful Timeless Classic Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine. A Masterpiece that Transends Generations The novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is a timeless story of an orphaned girl. The story of Jane Eyre begins with a look into her unpleasant life while living with her cruel aunt and cousins. To escape her family, Jane escapes to a school in which she spends eight years. Upon leaving Lowood, Jane decides to better her life by becoming a governess. She takes this position at a place called Thornfield Hall where she teaches a young girl named Adele.This novel is well interpreted to show the struggles of an orphaned girl. It also demonstrates how much courage a woman can have in their life even though things may seem impossible.This book is likely to appeal to an older age group. The language is difficult to understand at times and younger people may have trouble staying interested just because the novel is extremely descriptive. An older age group would probably have enough patience to let the splendor of the story unfold. It's also a longer story of 456 pages in which really could have been written well in half the length. Jane Eyre Book Review Though there were a few minor changes in this version, it definitely does not alter the spirit of the great narrative, nor does it inhibit the reader's comprehension. Given the fact that it is a free edition, this is a fantastic vessel toward familiarity with a true classic. A Great Read This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane. Great book! This book is a great book for those that love stories about love, duty, and the Victorian era. I loved Jane Eyre's character because it was the typical heroine from this time in British History. She is dutiful and proper despite her low circumstances. I love Victorian novels because they always have a happy ending! Wonderful Romance I LOVE this edition! It has so many helpful explanations in the back - it's a fantastic work of a beautiful, beautiful book. I have several copies - this is my favorite - hands-down.My only criticism is the ribbon - it unravels too easily. Bind the end of it so it doesn't do that. PERFECTION!! If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school! Classic for Young Women and Christians So glad I re-read this classic. Reading it 40 years after the first time opened my eyes to aspects of history and the beauty of this classic that I didn't see the first time. Wonderful book I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book. Thios book has meaning suprizing twist and turn. It makes you feel sorry for Jane everything that happens to her. Charlotte wrote this book as if she were Jane. It simply amazing. It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!! This is a very ssuspensefull and emotionally enrapturing book. I suggest it to anyone looking to read a great book.God Bless ~Amy A very rich fulfilling story one of the best novels written. Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :) BRILLIANT!!",

         "Crossing: A Memoir",
         "This is the story of one Donald McCloskey, a biological male who went on to become a full transsexual. He is now a transsexual as well as a widely published economist. I learned a lot from this memoir about the life of a transsexual who started out as a married, heterosexual cross-dresser. He erotically cross-dressed before becoming a transsexual.I was hoping for a more theoretical framework. For example, there is NO mention of the major kinds of transsexuality. There is absolutely NO mention whatsoever of autogynephilia or of homosexual transsexuality for that matter. None. I also wondered about Deirdre's sexual life post-operatively, as I am sure other readers did.I liked the photographs of Don and Deirde both pre- and post-operatively.The narrative is a little hard to read because of all the bold face, mixed with regular face. I think this was meant to emphasize McCloskey's transsexual verus heterosexuality identity.Despite the book's inherent limitations, I would recommend McCloskey's interesing memoir to anyone seriously interested in transsexuality. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone looking for a more formal treatment of either autogynephilia or homosexual transsexuality. A Somewhat Limited But Useful Perspective I found Deirdre's memoir refreshing, honest, and insightful, as well as humorous. Deirdre is not an author who takes her self too seriously, though dealing with personal experiances that are both serious and painful.Her story brought back memories of my childhood. My mother was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic and institutionalized when I was 7 years old.I highly recommend this book. It does have some &quot;mild profanities&quot; such as &quot;jeez&quot; and &quot;God&quot; (used litely in the beginning, but it turns into a heart felt prayer) Scholar Finds True Self I was utterly fascinated by the author's transformation. At the start of the book we meet Donald McCloskey, a noted economist, as well as husband, father, and professor. We also learn that he is a compulsive cross dresser who walks around casually in women's clothing and heavy make up--at home. In his 50s, Donald had a major life epiphany and decided to become a transsexual. He has \"the works\"---breast implants, electrolysis, facial feminization, female voice surgery, and sex reassignment surgery. The results are evident in the photographs (before and after) in the center section of the book. \"Deidre\" is a tall, blond, large-boned transsexual. Arms folded, legs crossed, \"Deirdre\" is not exactly my image of the womanly ideal. But judge for yourself.I found the author's literary style a bit unnerving. All those bold \"thoughts\" made me wonder who was speaking---Donald or Deirdre the Transsexual? The Economist is Transsexual American jokes often begin with &quot;You know that someone or something is ... if ...&quot; and the list goes on. I will not build up such a list on McCloskey's book, (anyway, I do not try to be funny either) but rather give you one personal reason why I loved it.The author, at first, convinces you that her crossing is truly a &quot;state of being&quot; and not what most of us would take as some sort of obscure fantasy. The reader is then &quot;sympathetic&quot; to her in the very first meaning of the word: I understand and I suffer with you, especially as things go wrong with her surgeries and with her family.But here come the mixed feelings: is she not responsible for being rejected by her wife and her children? For instance, was she not expecting too much from her daughter when signing &quot;Deirdre and Dad&quot; at the end of one letter ? Was &quot;Dad&quot; only not more appropriate to show that her new physical appearance changed nothing about the love she has for her daughter?At the end, the reader cannot help but ask himself where would he likely stands in all this and long after finishing the book he would think and think over it again. As for me, this is a sure way to recognize &quot;a great book&quot;.Finally, the book is well written and it is hard to skip a single page when you put both your mind and your feelings into it, which is surprisingly easy once you began to read it. A Great Book! This is a great read. There aren't many trannsexual memoirs as honest and riveting as McCloskey's whirlwind tour, from married heterosexual to avowed transsexual.My main complaint is straightforward. This memoir does not elaborate on contemporary scientific theories on the origins of transseuxality. Odd for a book that purports to be part memoir, part social science. I was hoping to find more information on autogynephilia--either an affirmation or denunciation of the concept. Where does McCloskey stand on this subject? He writes about gender as if it were disconnected from sex. How true is this in real life?Despite the book's inherent limitations, it's a great read and suitable for a general readership. A Good Read, Illustrative",

         "Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day: Proven Secrets of the Potty Pro [toilet training]",
         "I bought this book for my daughter thinking it was another with a similar title that I'd used to potty train her sister almost 35 years ago. Still, when it arrived, I kept it and looked through it. The approach was similar to the book I thought I was buying, but seemed more complicated and, frankly, a little over the top. (Potty parties with princess, super hero or other themes??!)I'm sure the approach works well, but in today's economy I wonder how many families could afford the cost, which if you calculate the price of the potty doll (between $45 and $65) plus the recommended videos, books, treats, party decorations, etc could easily run several hundred dollars! There were some good ideas the book,but I'm afraid this grandmother prefers the simpler, less expensive approach ofToilet Training in Less Than A Dayby Azrin and Foxx. A little over the top... It was ok. I have a special needs child and wish it had more info to help. Needless to say, we're still in diapers. He now goes every morning and most nights before bed, but still wets throughout the day. It was OK We've used this book as our method for potty training all three of our kids, our oldest, a girl, was successfully potty trained at 2 1/2 (Teri gives guidelines to check for readiness, so don't assume that 2 1/2 is too early, nor that 3 1/2 is too late - let your child's development level guide you - that's tip number one!). Our two boys, a couple years apart, also potty trained with this method.I will say this, plan for a marathon day. We were literally physically EXHAUSTED after the training party day, but the lesson stuck every time. (Tip #2, get the doll she suggests, one that pees on command!)With our daughter, we had concerns about whether to interrupt the day for her nap, and we emailed the author, who includes her email address. How surprised were we when the next day we got a phone call from Teri herself! We talked for about 1/2 an hour, she gave us great advice (skip the nap, the day will be busy and that's the point, plus early bed time!) I absolutely CANNOT guarantee that she'll call you, but we were blown away that an Author would do that!SIMPLY PUT: Buy this book. Read it. Even if you don't follow it to the proverbial T, you'll get good advice that you can use when you (and your wee one(s)) are ready. Great Book, And The Author Called Us! I bought this book after my best friend and my son's pediatritian reccommended the techniques used by Terri. I soon learned that my bigest battle for potty training my son was my readiness not his. What an eye opener. So after having my husband take the parent readiness test, we discovered that it would be better if he threw my son his potty party. And I am happy to say it worked! Since we had the party a month or so ago we have only had a couple of accidents (too preocupied) and have just conquered the overnight step, and my son is 3years and 3 months, yeah! I have to also note that I am doubly impressed with Terri. My best friend has had a terrible time, and I mean drag out, knock down, in tears terrible time with her son (same age as mine). So with nothing to loose I emailed Terri and to my surprise she called me back to give more help and suggestions. Needless to say my friend is relieved that even if things don't go smoothly, there are still ways Terri can help. Terri has so much compassion and concern for both parent and child. I never thought that I would have such an amazing expireince from just one book! Great tool for potty training any child I was very skeptical that my son could be trained in one day. However, my girlfriend swears by Crane's methods, so I got the book, purchased all necessary items, and threw a superhero-themed potty party. It was EXHAUSTING! But, my son had a lot of fun. After 3 days (not one), my son was potty trained and stopped having accidents. In the end, I think the potty party is worth all the fuss because you don't drag out the pull ups, diapers, and training for months and months. It sends a clear message to the child to pee and poop on the potty and not in a diaper anymore. It worked! I saw this book at Barnes & Noble on sale and immediately sat down with my laptop to check the reviews before buying it. Based on those, I thought \"what the heck\" and bought the book. I had been working with my daughter on potty training (admittedly sporadically and not with a consistent method) for 9 months. She was 2 1/2 when I first started with her and about 3 and 3 months when we had her potty party. We went for the princess theme and I have to say, even if the concepts in the book hadn't worked, it would have all been worth it for the look on her face when she woke up to her party and the experience we had bonding as mother and daughter without all of the other family members in the house. I will say that it took extensive preparation in getting all of the decorations purchased, making arrangements to be alone in the house for the day and I felt like I was cramming for a college final the night before the party to make sure I was saying the right things and doing it all in the right order. But it was worth every effort and dollar spent. She went from going potty in the toilet 2 or 3 times over the course of MONTHS and just not being interested in it AT ALL to going 5 times on the day of the party with ZERO accidents. She is still using pull-ups at nap and bed time, but I don't care. She's had a handful of accidents in the month since we had the party and I don't care about that either. We used the Fisher Price musical princess potty and bought a doll that looks like a toddler to train her with. My only complaint is that the author suggests dolls to use for the party that look like babies...with bottles. Uhm, if you're going to use a doll to potty train your toddler, shouldn't the doll look like your toddler? With that being said, the only toddler-looking doll that potties on the market (that I could find anyway) would wet her pants as soon as you had her drink something. Oh well, that just created more opportunities to talk with my daughter about using her \"potty training memory muscles\" after we have an accident. If you've never heard a 3-year-old say \"potty training memory muscles\" then buy this book if for no other reason than that. :) No one was more stunned than I that it ACTUALLY WORKED! I took the survey in the book and found out my child is not ready for potty training yet. It was a big help. Potty Train Your child in just one day. This book was our lifesaver. I purchased the book a couple of months before I began to potty train my son. He was just approaching his 3rd birthday and started to show some interest in the potty. I went through the checklist \"Are they Ready to Potty Train\" section of the book and it confirmed he was. I did not spend a lot of money as some people mentioned in the past reviews. The only extra money I spent was on the doll \"Paul\" I thought that would really help my son make him seem more real. There was quite a bit of preparation but I was able to create the snacks, drinks, activities and decorations with things we already had at home but it was because I picked a theme with things we already had.... camping. My son already had a play tent, sleeping bag and accessories. I made animal printouts from my computer and drew trees on easel paper and paints we already had in our craft area. I went to the local library and checked out every book and DVD that had to do with potty training. The hassle is mainly just getting everything together. The party went off with out a hitch and by the end of the day he was asking to go to the bathroom without me telling him it was time to go and throwing his diapers away at his end of the day party. I definitely think that this is the way to go with potty training. The day could not of gone better and it also helped my husband and I get into potty mode. :) I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for new ideas to potty train. If anything my son loved didn't even know what we were doing other than spending the day with him mom and dad alone with no interruptions playing make believe camping, \"fishing\", doing scavenger hunts, singing, readying books (about potty training) and finding funny ways to run to the bathroom. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this wonderful book and helping my son realize that he is now one of the big boys! Great Book - Would HIGHLY Recommend!! I read this book after talking with two co-workers who had fantastic success with the potty party method. It sounded a little too good to be true, but given their success, I had to go for it. (I'd also had the opportunity to see the author speak at our daughter's day care, and I loved the fact that she was a real person; but that's not really relevant.) We picked a three-day weekend to throw a party for our 25-month old daughter. She'd shown great signs of readiness, but I was still a little skeptical that this would work. I shouldn't have worried. The weekend was great. She loved the party, got completely into the potty (stickers and treats were a big incentive) and after hitting the two week mark today, she's accident free during the day. We're still having some trouble at night, but I'm not discouraged. I do have to say, though, that following the no-diaper rule is key. Do NOT cave. One other point about this author in particular: I was incredibly nervous about our daughter's first day back at day care without diapers. I was so nervous, in fact, that I sent the author a couple of questions through the form on her website. She actually CALLED me with some advice. It was great to feel like I had someone on my side. A great guide, a tried-and-true method I have a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy. I used the potty party for my little girl ( at age 2) and she nailed potty training. I was skeptical to use this method on my little boy- everyone kept telling me that he was too young...boys take longer etc. Well, too young or not- he nailed potty training as well using the same method in this book...matter of fact after only an hour and 45 minutes- he was tired of training his doll and wanted his diaper off! I was stunned, I had only trained my daughter according to the book- so I just winged it from that point on...he had a couple of accidents but at the end of the day, he was 7 for 11 at the toilet! The next day was 13 out of 14....and we havent had an accident since! When the book tells you that YOU need to be ready...YOU DO! It is an exhausting day...but totally worth it! If you have other kids- you have to ship them off to the grandparents or a friends house ( I also have a 5 month old) the focus needs to be on the trainee! You can do this....its that easy! Worked like a charm! I give this book 3 stars because it's one of the most interesting books on potty training I've read, yet its approach wasn't a \"miracle cure\" for my child.I tried Teri's approach with my daughter a week before her 4th birthday. I spent about 6 weeks reading and re-reading Teri's book, taking notes on it, buying items for the party and otherwise preparing for it. I don't think I could have been readier for it than I was.The morning of the party went fairly well. However, I was slightly disappointed in the Emma Corolle doll (the one most recommended by Teri). The bottle leaked, and getting the bottle in the doll's mouth \"just right\" was tricky. So when I would try to feed the bottle to the doll, the doll (and its underwear) would get wet. Also, if the doll's belly was pressed even slightly, the doll would pee. So, we had a number of accidents with the doll that I didn't intend to stage! If I had to do it all over again, I would have bought a cheaper doll with no wetting function, and I would have just pretended it was peeing into the potty by holding a bottle behind it (as Teri did at the party for her own son).The afternoon party was a lot of fun, but it didn't work miracles with my daughter. I never did get her to pee on the potty. She did have two accidents, one of which occurred almost immediately after she'd spent a long time sitting on the potty. Even though my daughter is almost 4, I think she just doesn't \"get it.\" She doesn't understand yet how to control her bladder and pee \"on demand\".So I am a bit disappointed, but I do think we made some progress today. For one thing, my daughter wore underwear for an 8-hour stretch. She's never worn underwear that long before. For another thing, by dedicating the whole day to potty training, I was able to observe how often my daughter absolutely has to pee. These observations should help me in coming days as I try to time my daughter's sessions on the potty \"just right\" to try to catch her when she most has to pee.If I had this experience to do all over again, here is what I would have done differently:- I would have bought a cheap doll with no drink and wet function so I could have controlled its output better;- I would have offered only salty treats to my daughter. I offered both sweet and salty and she chose only sweet. If she'd had only salty things to eat, I think she would have been thirstier and been willing to drink more. Maybe this would have resulted in my daughter making a pee on the potty.- I would have tried to stay within a budget. I think part of my disappointment with the day was spending so much time and money putting together the \"perfect\" party as outlined in Teri's book. Teri makes it clear you don't have to go \"all out\" that way, but having a Type A personality, it was my instinct to do that. In retrospect, though, I wish I wouldn't have gotten so carried away.- I would have been more honest with myself about my daughter's readiness. Conventional wisdom is that, at nearly 4 years old, she should have been trained long ago. But there are a lot of signs of readiness that she is lacking. Above all, she lacks the desire to be thought of as a \"big kid.\" That desire is central to Teri's approach. So, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise to me that the approach didn't work wonders on my daughter who lacks that desire.-- I would have accepted the fact that potty training isn't going to happen with a flick of the wrist and snap of the fingers. Not that Teri says it will, even with her approach. But I have to admit I was hoping that we could rush the process and \"get it over with\" in one day and not have to worry about it much after that. Evidently, that's not how things are going to work, at least for my daughter.So, I do recommend giving Teri's approach a try (with the aforementioned pointers in mind), but I also advocate reading Elizabeth Pantley's \"No-Cry Potty Training Solution.\" It's almost the opposite approach to Teri's, but if you have a child who is a late, reluctant trainer the way mine is, it may be more realistic for your situation. Pantley gives lots of tips for working on potty training gradually over a long period of time. Worthwhile read, but may not work wonders This book has helped us in so many ways! We tried to potty train our son with no success several times. In desperation, I read Teri Crane's book and tried the potty party. Although it initially worked, after the novelty wore off, my son somewhat regressed. I went to the web site and emailed Teri Crane, and she contacted me immediately with many more helpful ideas and suggestions!In the past year I have found invaluable help from the book, especially the back section with information with the experts, and most of all from Teri Crane. She is an author who believes in her product and is willing to help. She has given me, more than anything, empathy, understanding and peace of mind. Even if it takes more than one day........ I can understand where this concept might work for some kids, but I was very disappointed with the results we experienced. My son is 2 1/2 and very interested in the potty. He's been using it every night before bath to pee and poop for several months, so I thought the \"potty party\" would be a great opportunity to encourage him to use it during the day and more regularly. He was SO EXCITED with the party theme and all the decorations and treats. We used a large stuffed Buzz Lightyear as his potty doll and I creatively (and discretely) \"wet\" his underwear and created play-doh poop accidents, as the book suggests. My son was very good at \"teaching\" Buzz that he had to use the potty and rewarding him on his sticker chart and from the treat tray, but he clearly got annoyed with the frequency of having to practice using the potty. He would leave Buzz in the bathroom and go back to the \"party\". After lunch, the prizes, and a nap, he woke up excited to go back to the party and THRILLED to be wearing \"no pants!\", just his underwear. As much as he loved wearing his underwear, and although we had a successful poop and a couple successful pee incidents in the potty, after his third accident he became very discouraged and upset with having soiled his underwear (even as he was doing it, he became very upset.) We told him accidents happen, just like Buzz, and he just had to practice his \"potty memory muscles\" (as per the book's instructions) just like Buzz, but by the 3rd accident he outright refused to even sit on the potty or go in the bathroom. It was quickly slipping into a discouraging experience for him and having an ADVERSE effect on the overall training. Before we risked traumatizing him, we stopped pushing him. The problem was, he took going back to a diaper as punishment, and cried because he wanted to wear the \"soft\" underwear. I managed to coax him into using pull-ups, but in the end, it was very disappointing and I feel that it took us a step backwards. I'll have to wait a while before we can try again. He used to smile and run to use the potty. Now he loses his smile and hesitates, and during the day he simply wants no part of it. My suggestion would be to keep an eye on your child and see how s/he is reacting to the \"potty\" portion of the training, not just the party. I'm in the process now of reading 3 other books on potty training approaches to see which might work better for my son. He still wants nothing more than to wear underwear instead of pull-ups or diapers, so that's a great incentive for us. Good luck. Good concept- not for everyone I read 3 other potty training books by so called \"experts\" and none of them worked. This is hands down the best book I read, and more importantly, it worked. If you take the time to read and implement, you will get the results you desire. This Book Works. Must Buy. The concept of the book is something that really interested me. My daughter enjoys parties (especially the hats) so I knew this would work for us. I was excited to spend so much one-on-one time with her as we celebrated this milestone together. I felt my daughter picked up on the ideas of the doll and the rewards very quickly. She was always excited to give her doll a present and a treat and a sticker when she successfully used the potty. When it was my daughter's turn to use the potty, she understood what the whole routine was. I know she had a lot of fun and we had a great time at her celebration that evening where she and some of her friends rode the merry-go-round at the mall. She wasnt 100% potty trained in one day, but she has done excellent pretty much since the party. This was a girl who refused to use the potty before the party turned it into something that was worth while for her to accomplish. The book was a quick read and very to the point, which I appreciated in my busy \"no time to read\" life. I reccomend this book to people who want to celebrate and have fun with their children as they become \"big girls and boys\". Fun time with my child My child (2 yrs old) was terrified of the thought of using the potty when we started this program on Friday. Today is Monday and I just called my mother in law who reported that she willingly sat on the potty and made pee pee. This is the sencond time she goes to the bathroom alone today without an incident. Don't get me wrong, by no means would Iconsider my child \"potty trained\" completely, but the book is an amazing start. First of all, my child was terrified of the potty, so by teaching the doll and incorporating the treats, she really lost that fear. Second of all, the book has amazing tips and ways to handle accidents, incentives for using the potty, etc. I highly recommend this book. I followed all of the steps in regards to the doll and the treats and sticker chart. We saw a number of videos and books, but we really didn't spend so much on decorations and all that stuff. She was just content to have me spend the entire day doing all sorts of activities. I picked a princess theme since her potty is princess themed. I got some wands and crowns, picked up a few princess coloring books. I painted her little toes princess pink because mommy is a big girl and has hers painted. Throughout the party we just talked about being a big girl and how exciting it is. When she had accidents she got really freaked out. Kids DO NOT LIKE THAT FEELING. So I said that accidents happen, and its not a big deal, etc. When I finally put her big girl underpants on, she did not pee for 4 hours! I was afraid she was holding it in, so I left an email with the author, and she called me right away to talk me through it. It was so incredibly nice of her to do. I'm very happy! Great Start! This program is a huge help with all kinds of potty \"isues\", I will definetly be recommending this book to everyone!! Thank youPotty Train Your Child in Just One Day: Proven Secrets of the Potty Pro [toilet training] A smart approach to potty training I bought this book without any thoughts on it taking one day. My son was 2 1/2 when we started. Of course it took us about a couple of weeks but I believe that the premise of this book made that possible. I really suggest that you put alot of planning into the party. We did Dora as the theme and I was able to find \"backpack\" in the gift bag section and used that to hold the \"rewards for using the potty\". I gave the book a 3 because it is hard to train your child in one day but at the cost for the book it is worthy of being in your library! Good luck! Not one day but still good info.... I would highly recommend this book to anyone potty training. It really works! And the process was a good bonding experience as well. It Works! We did our potty party last Saturday, and one week later we are on day three of ZERO accidents!! My son turns 3 tomorrow and he's the kind of kid who likes to sit and read books and do puzzles so we did not need to struggle with sitting on the potty. I have to admit there were a couple of times on party day that I had my doubts and it was not smooth sailing. But the results have been tremendous, and just as important for me, my son and I are closer than ever and have bonded over the experience. A couple of logistics notes: we used a lot of imagination and not a lot of props so don't worry if you don't think you have the time, creativity or energy (or money) to do the full blown party. M&Ms and Thomas stickers have kept us going through the week! I blogged the full experience of our day at [...] if you want to know more! Great Book, Great Outcome This book really did help me potty train my daughter! We had our potty party 1 week ago and now she pees mostly in the toliet-maybe a few dribbles here and there! We have yet to poo poo on the potty; but it will happen. I did elimination communication with my daughter early on and she did great. After some major family stresses and moves we stopped. I tried taking her to the potty and she would just fuss and scream; so I left it alone for a few months. My daughter is 23 months old and doesn't talk a lot but she says \"pee pee\" and \"potty\"-so we went for it. I bought her doll at Kmart is was around $15.00; it is not as good as the corelle dolls but it did the trick. We had a \"Princess party\" I bought cheap party favor Tiaras and Disney princess panties. Princess fruit snacks, punch, etc. The first day she had 2 accidents in the morning and 2 pees on the potty in the afternoon. My daughter doesn't really care for stickers yet; but the do entertain her. She really liked M&M's! All of the supplies can seem costly-I got a lot of stuff at TJ Maxx and Big Lots-discount stores! Yesterday we had no accidents; even after a 1 hour trip to the park; she was dry! I highly recommend Pampers Easy ups over Pull ups-My daughter has worn Huggies all her life; but the Pull ups are a rougher material and gave her a rash if she woke up wet. The Pampers Easy ups are great, she likes them and she seems to know if she is wet or not! Great Book; I recommend devoting 3 days to not leaving the house when attempting to train. Working for Wee Wee! There are some helpful suggestions in this book.The layout of the book is good for busy parents.The humor the author uses throughout helps ease anxiety about the subject matter.I suggest purchasing some page tabs to secure throughout the book while reading.

         "Jessica Darling goes about her life in her \"just darling\" high school bubble, but inwardly she is screaming for relief from the stupid teenage drama of Pineville High. Her best friend Hope has moved away and left Jessica to battle insomnia, gossip, lack of period, parental expectations, and her older sister's wedding all by herself. To top that, the enigmatic Marcus Flutie - whose reputation reeking of drugs and sex precedes him - becomes inexplicably the one person Jessica can turn to.I've been wanting to read this series forever and finally found all the books at the same time. Jessica Darling is the epitome of a teenager who feels lost amid the high school routine, but doesn't know what she's looking for. Written in journal form, I got sucked into Jessica's honest and snarky observations of the life around. sloppy firsts will definitely appeal to anyone who has ever felt like a freak of nature that no one will ever understand - with Jessica, you'll find good company! Not a bit sloppy! Sharp and snarky and perfect! I really enjoyed this book. Being a teenager myself (15), i could relate to a lot of the things she felt.The book is really Jessica Darling's journal entries, but not the &quot;Dear Diary&quot; type you'd expect. Her life is complicated when her best friend, Hope, moves far away, and she is left with shallow friends who she doesn't really like. Things aren't any better at home, dealing with her father who only cares about her running, mother who is obbsessed with her sister's upcoming wedding. Both her mother and sister being blonde's, she tends to feel like the &quot;ugly-duckling&quot;.GET THIS BOOK!! it really was a great book, i bet u'll be laughing out loud (i'm not just saying that...i really did!) at how cynical Jess can be at times. Light-hearted novel you'll enjoy I swear, that was me in middle school. I love books that make me happy and sad at the same time, and this was definitely one of them. That was me This book is just amazing, even when you used to be 15 or 16 (but no longer are!). It's very well written and there's lots of action. All characters are well developed, the setting is good, and the storyline is VERY good. And I like the little twist with Marcus Flutie! LOVE Jessica Darling I love these books. I started reading them when i was 16, and ten years later, I still like them. Funny, honest, and witty. I am in love with this series There is no other way to express this compelling novel other than that it was absolutly awsome. At first, it is hard to get a feel for all the characters but after the first 20 pages you are instantly taken into the life of this teen who is way cooler than she realizes. Jessica Darling is stuck in the last semester of sophmore year in high school with out her best friend. You soon learn why hope has moved. I can't say much with out giving the whole story away, but you have got to read it. awsome I absolutlely loves &quot;Sloppy Firsts&quot; and I can not wait to read the follow up novel if their shall be one. I was dissapoined in the end for one reason that you will discover when you read it. Megan McCaferty really makes you fall in love with Jessica Darling (the lead character) and you find yourself missing her when you are done the book. A must read for any highschooler. Keeps you hooked This book had me rolling on the floor laughing so hard. Omigod! It was like &quot;quote&quot; so like true to life &quot;unquote&quot;. (No I don't really talk like that, I was making fun of a few characters in the book).I can see how some of the things in this book would go right over the head of someone born after 1985. There are a few 80s references that some young teens may not get. This is a great book to read if you are in your late 20s or 30s, although the language and slang sounds like teens today.Jessica is my new hero. I'm still laughing at &quot;vagitarian&quot;. Can't wait to read the sequel. Effing hilarious Jessica Darling's best friend, Hope, has just moved 1000 miles away. Hope was more than just Jessica's best friend, she was the only person keeping her sane. Hope's absence makes dealing with her pseudo friends, the ultra popular &quot;clueless crew,&quot; unbearable. Jessica is also having boy trouble. The school's star jock, Scott, wants to date her but Jessica finds herself oddly attracted to Marcus, the school junkie.This is the best teen novel that I've read in ages. Finally a novel about high school life that hasn't been watered down for younger readers. Jessica's bleak and sarcastic narrative about her fellow classmates will appeal to everyone who was miserable in high school. Daria fans will especially enjoy this series. I recommend this book to everyone, even people who can't stand the thought of reading a teen book. Sloppy Firsts This book is extremly funny. You'll want to read it over again, each time a new book for the series comes out. The main character, Jessica, is so funny and cynical, sometimes to a fault. This is a book for girls starting at age 15. The content can be a little racey and there is profanity. Anyone who is looking for a Sarah Dessen-esque book should read this series. Perfect teen series Once you turn the first page your hooked. Jessica Darling is a witty honor student, who finds herself in a new light. She's your average high school student, and she goes through drama that all of us have faced, at one point or another. The high school she attends seems average, and has all the normal cliques. This novel was one of my favorites. Megan McCafferty goes into the mind of today's teen and comes out with this amazing character. In the book Jessica starts falling for a &quot;Krispy Creme&quot; a boy who, doesn't seem her type. I think anyone who has been through the drama of high school, would enjoy this book. Other books i would reccomend would be Gossip Girl. The both deal with high school girls, going through the many dramas we face. This is a great book Young adult fiction is my secret vice. I admit it! Every now and then there's nothing better than a re-read of a childhood favorite, or, as in the case of Sloppy Firsts, the discovery of something new and wonderful. Quite truthfully, I expected Sloppy Firsts to be nothing more than a pleasant romp. I was surprised to find that though the book was immensely easy to read, it was also thoughtful and substantive. Ms. McCafferty manages to touch on so many of the universal strains and pains of adolescence; it seems like one would be hard pressed to find a woman or girl who can't in some small (or large!) way relate to the misunderstood Jessica Darling. If I had to criticize the book in any way, it would perhaps be that it's _too_ perceptive and well-written. As the novel is written as excerpts from Jessica's diary, it's a bit of a stretch to believe that a high-school sophomore would be quite so eloquent and insightful. That tiny little peeve aside, I highly recommend Sloppy Firsts to anyone who has ever been a teenage girl. A Truly Touching Coming of Age Story When I read a describtion of this book ...I was sure I'd love it, so I bought it. The first two pages, I had some doubts but I kept reading and immediatley fell in love. It's so realistic and I think all teenage girls can relate. Its unique, funny, and refreshingly witty! I totally recommend buying this book! By Far The Coolest Book I've Ever Read Absolutely loved this book! What a gem. Just finished it and cannot wait to read Second Helpings. After even just being halfway through the first book, I went ahead and bought, Second Helpings, Charmed Thirds and Fourth Comings. This book just kept me turning the pages. I love Jessica Darling's voice, Marcus Flutie, etc. This has been one of my all-time favorites! I highly recommend it. I recommended to my daughter-in-law and she read the first three in a couple of days. She's on Fourth Comings now and LOVES them. Awesome job Megan McCafferty Nothing Sloppy About This Book This story is not unique. I can be Jessica Darling. You can be Jessica Darling. Any 16-year-old girl in an American high school can be Jessica Darling. In other words, this is relatable material, focusing on a year in the life of a young girl dealing with mostly typical teenage angst. Jessica Darling, a self-proclaimed brainiac, deals with her best friend moving away, and trying to fit in with a group of girls she dislikes. Meanwhile, she struggles with her mother, who is obsessively planning her older sister's wedding, with a sort-of boyfriend, and a head-game happy boy genius who stimulates her intellect and likes her \"as a friend.\"Jessica is wise beyond her years and that appeals to me since I've been out of high school for a VERY long time. It made me wish I were that smart when I was a confused high school girl. Overall I found her take on the world quite entertaining. The writing is fast-paced, crisp, and funny. I'm not sure I'd let my daughters read this, due to the frank outlay of sex and drugs in the plot; however, for more mature readers, it's a bit of a romp into a juvenile, chick-lit world that made me think, \"been-there/done that.\"Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said. I Am Jessica Darling Although Jessica Darling may at first seem a bit eloquent and older than her supposed age of 15-16, her quirky view of high school life and the enjoyable rhythm of her words will soon draw the reader in and make her, or him, suspend disbelief. Jessica is devastated by her best friend's move, but still plucky and resigned to carrying on with high school. Her feelings of superiority to her more one-dimensionally characterized classmates are right in line with a real teen view of the world revolving around her and her troubles. It is rewarding to see Jessica grow and realize that the people she takes for granted, such as her mother, a former close friend, and the new girl in school, have more layers than she suspected. Jessica matures throughout the book, and the reader routes for her all the way. Her funny, pithy observations offer insight into the crazy high school merry go round. Her human tendancy to lie is balanced by her strong sense of honor, which shows itself in other ways. Overall, an engrossing, fun read with some depth. I look forward to Sloppy Seconds, or whatever the next Darling title may be. Refreshing This book is really great. it has just the right mix of humor,love and real life. i could indetify with the girl in this story. i've read &quot;Sisterhood of the travlin pants&quot; but i like this better because its funnier and could actually happen. any teenage girl should really like this book. check it out you wont be disapointed! My favorite book Jessica Darling's (I know, what a great name) best friend, Hope, moves away and she's stuck around her \"so called friends\" that she doesn't like. Her dad keeps pushing her to keep running while secretly she wants to quit. And then there's Marcus Flutie--the school bad boy and dreg nicnamed krispy creme for always being at a crisp for doing drugs and having \"done\" two dozen girls. She starts having phone conversations with him and he messes with her mind. Jessica is Marcus's first friend that he hasn't slept with. But he knows her better than anyone else, including her \"so called friends\".This book is so funny, Jessica does the dumbest things that make you laugh while you're reading it. Megan McCafferty's voice comes through strong in this book from her vocabulary and all the 80's type words she throws into it like: bubblegum bimbo.Will I reread it?Yes, I adore this series. Yes, it is indeed a series so you don't have to stop at this book.I would probably recommend this to a more older teenage audience because of the language and some of the scenes are pretty graphic. I overall really enjoyed this book and thought of it as a perfect start to a wonderful and unique series. One of my favorite books This was a great novel in that there was a very nice mixture of plot and characters fleshed out a little better than paper thin. I really liked Jess, the protagonist. She came off as a real girl, and I enjoyed being inside her head with all her OCD thought and teen-angst worries, gripes and hypocrisies.On the down side, this book is littered with references to sex and not a few expletives. When I was a teen, you had to read Jackie Collins to get this kind of stuff. Promising, but... &quot;Sloppy Firsts&quot; is by far one of the greatest books I've ever read. Megan McCaffery has really outdone herself on this book. I read the entire book in less than a day. I couldn't put it down! The main character in the book, Jessica Darling, is one of the most relatable characters I've ever read about! I give this book 5 stars, as one of the best I've ever read. Sloppy Firsts This was just great! I really liked this. I didn't realize at first, however, that this was written in the form of diary entries and letters. But it well written so it conveyed the story and wasn't written in shorthand (which I hate). Mostly, I found this hilarious. Since it is written in a diary, I think we get the more snarky side of Jessica, while getting the dialogue as well.Jessica was a fun character. I really enjoyed her story. Man, she seems to have some horrible luck! Although Marcus seemed like that kid you shouldn't associate, I found myself liking him and secretly hoping that they would at least become friends. I felt bad for Jessica, after Hope moved away. It seems she really only has the one friend who really gets her and that she truly likes.I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be an insomniac and seeing what goes through Jessica's head was interesting. Her need to run (without her dad there to make it not fun) just to shut off her brain for a few minutes.This was a highly enjoyable book. I have read a lot of good things about it and I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Great Read! Sloppy firsts is about a teenager going through troubling times just like any ordinary teenage girl would be. Jessica Darling best friend just moved so she is like a fish out of water at school and a stranger at home. She doesn't now how she is suppose to deal with the boy- and shopping crazy girls at school also known as the Clueless Crew, her dad's obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over her big sister Bethany's lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life. I enjoyed this book very much I think it describes a teenage girls life in high school, also me and Jessica had a lot in come due to the fact that she liked track too. This book made it seem like Jessica wasn't just a character she felt like a real person.I recommend this book to 8-12 graders. This book is very mature and I think that this should be taken seriously it is very interesting. If you read it in 7th grade me may not understand what something she says. There is a few curses, and inappropriate descriptions. If you want to read a book about a high school going through problems this is an excellent book! Sloppy First a Great book and it has a sequel ! I picked up this book at borders cause it had a cool cover and i wanted something to read on my plane ride home. I can't tell you how happy I was that I did. I couldn't put the book down. Jessica is such a real character because she could be the girl who sits next to me in science or math class. She has real problems and real solutions. I think that the book is witty, humourous, poingant and moving. An impressive debut. Can't wait for the next book. A Very Good Book Sloppy Firsts is a great book! Its centers on Jessica Darling and her high school experience. Jessica is trying to find who she is while dealing with her best friend Hope moved away and is now left with her &quot;friends&quot; which she says have no depth. Jessica writes everything in her journal,( which is how the book reads) and deals with high school itself, boys, and friends. It a great funny book! Sloppy Firsts!! Jessica 'Notso' Darling is the witty, satirical narrator of this epistolary novel. Through a series of journal entries and wistful emails to her long distance BFF, we learn about Jessica's trials & tribulations as a high school student. From being labeled a 'brainiac', being the subject of a tell-all expose, and dashing her father's dreams of an Olympic athelete, Megan McCafferty tackles all of the teenage angst that some of us have experienced and others of us are just buckling into the seat on the rollercoaster.McCafferty has three more books in the Jessica Darling series, and I can't wait to see what's in store for her next! Isn't She Darling? This book was very good. It took me took me on a roller coaster of emotions. But the ending was horrible. and sometimes horrible endings ruin books. Sloppy Firsts This book was very funny yet was very realistic of an every day life of a teenager! I really recommend this book to any teenage girl, it really makes you think about your own life and how some things really don't matter.Again it was a very good book and i hope that every one liked it as much as me! A Really Great Book Good book -- I felt like I was back in high school again. I'm glad that Jessica was a &quot;normal&quot; girl. She was most women in high school, and I could completely relate to her. Add to that that my friend called me when I was 2/3 through the book and started talking about our high school reunion that was held the previous night (I didn't attend), and I was right back there in 4th period study hall. A fun read, good escape. Back to High School this series is absolutely incredible. i picked up the book on a whim, but fell in love with jessica darling and her pineville woes, and eagerly counted down the days till the next two books were released. i havent been able to put down any of these books since the day i got them. i just read them over and over again. i think this shows a side of teenage life that is way more than your typical boy, best friend, and acne drama. it is witty, touching, wise, and just plain REAL. absolutely amazing read- don't pass it up! absolutely greeeaaaat!!! Megan McCafferty's novel about 16 year old Jessica Darling is one just about every girl can relate to in some way. From the dreams of finding that rare true guy friend (been there!), to the agony of not living up to your parents expectations (yep), unrequited love and unwanted love (yessum), to losing and finding your friends (for sure), this book covers a lot of topics that are just downright normal...but are made incredibly interesting through a variety of humorous situations and intelligent narration by Jessica via her personal journal. McCafferty's book doesn't after-school special teenage-hood, or make it uber boring, or super unbelievable, instead it makes you find the qualities most angsty teenagers have in themselves that relate to Jessica Darling, and draws you in as you look at your own experiences and compare them to Jessica's. (I'm 17 so I can definately relate!). A great effort, I can't wait to read the second book! A great mix of Adult Style with Realistic Teendom :) This book is not like the typical teenage books I have read many times in the past. Full of ironic humor and interesting twists, Sloppy Firsts is a joy to read the whole way through. There's simply never a dull moment in this book. It could really appeal to all age groups and genders. I'd reccomend it to anyone. It's a good book. awesome book. this truely is the most spectacular book i have ever read. meagan really knows how to write a good book. this will truely capture you for hours at a time. be sure to read this book its great. great book When I decided to try &quot;Sloppy Firsts,&quot; I was hoping for something along the lines of the Princess Diaries series or even Louise Rennison-tinged humour. What I got was a book about your average American girl who, in her trivial pursuits for hapiness, ends up finding out that she's pretty much been putting herself up for pain from day one.From her &quot;grounded gimphood&quot; to her miserable job at the boardwalk, all the way to &quot;Notso Darling's Agony of Defeat Volues I &amp; II,&quot; Jessica &quot;Notso&quot; Darling stands out as a character, individual in her own right and from those of most teen novels. Her best friend Hope moved away last year and now Jessica is left with the &quot;Clueless Crew,&quot; her so-called friends whom she actually despises. When Hy(acynth) Wallace comes to town, Jessica has high hopes for a friendship. Until Hy steals Jess's slogan &quot;Bubblegum bimbos&quot; and does a book on &quot;icky&quot; small town life.It has some hilarious moments, some touching moments and some very personal moments and I have to give the author credit for making the characters so lovable/loathable. Not bad... Sloppy Firsts: When Jessica Darling's best friend, Hope Weaver, moves out of Pineville, New Jersey, Jessica's life goes all out of wack. Hope is the only person who understands Jessica's quirky personality. So when Hope moves Jessica is left with nothing. She really doesn't have many friends, except the Clueless Crew (who she secretly hates) and Hy a new girl in school who soon becomes just another member of the crew. The boy that she is in love with doesn't even know she exists and on top of all of that she is a complete stranger in her own house. All her dad talks to her about is running and all of her many track meets and her mother is always busy with her older sister Bethany who is about to get married.Now that Hope is gone a new girl named Hy moves in. Jessica befriends her, but knows that she will never replace Hope. Hy and Jessica soon grow apart as becomes more involved with the Clueless Crew. The crew consists of Bridgett, Manda, and Sara, who are all \"Bubble- Gum Bimbos\" that are self- absorbed shop-a-holics who's only interests are boys and not getting fat. Jessica grows to hate the crew more and more as time goes by, but they have no idea.Jessica has turned into a major insomniac without Hope in her life. Whenever she can't sleep, which is every night, she goes out running in the middle or the night. But she soon is able to sleep again when she befriends Marcus Flutie, a surprisingly intelligent, mysterious drugie from school. She talks to him late at night about things she probably would never even think about talking with Hope. Jessica soon develops feelings for Marcus, but doesn't tell anyone, not even Hope. She soon finds her self lying to the most important person in her life.Jessica becomes alienated from everyone. Not even Marcus fulfills her desires anymore. Her father doesn't speak to her anymore because since she fractured her ankle on one of her midnight excursions they have nothing to talk about anymore. Her mother on the other hand tries to be with her more now that Bethany has left and there is no more wedding to plan. But Jessica just can't stand her mother treating Jessica like she is just another Bethany. Since she is her mother Jessica tries to be nice on her Birthday, but instead of this being a fun filled day it turns into a crying fest when Jessica tells her mother how she really feels about everything in her life. After this wonderful conversation they both understand each other and are willing to give it another try. But now school is almost over for Jessica and Hope will be coming soon and she is prepared to tell Hope everything, even about Marcus.This novel is very humorous and interesting to read, but it also reminds of all the difficulty of growing up. It reminds grown ups of all the hardships they had to go through in high school, like being popular and looking good for all the boys or girls at school. It is a wonderful teen book, especially when they are going through some of the changes that Jessica had to go through. It also should be read by adults and parent to remind them of the old days and try to understand their teens a little bit more. Sloppy Firsts this was one of the better books I've read in a long time. I actually laughed out loud and have passed this book on to several friends who have also loved it. \"Second Helpings\" the conclusion (how I hope not, I adore Jessica \"Not-so\" Darling) is also just as enjoyable. Still giggling about \"Bubblegum Bimbos and Assembly-line Meatballers\" I loved it! A fantastic book that womem of all ages should read. I couldn't put it down from the moment I read the first line. This would make a wonderful TV show or movie! Who wouldn't want to watch Jessica Darling through the rest of her journey into adulthood? NOT a Sloppy First! Such a great book. McCafferty's sense of humor is great. Even though her main character is a high school student, almost anyone can relate to her experiences (or at least remember what they were like).I'm almost thirty and loved it. The friend that recommended it is in her mid-thirties and I passed the book along to my fifteen year old neighbor. It's a great light read, that most will appreciate.The next two books are great as well. Fun for all ages Sloppy Firsts was my first foray back into teen fiction since I read \"the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" I few years ago. There's several things that I quickly noticed about this book. First off, if I had a young daughter, there is not much chance that I would let her read this book at any age younger than 17 (even though I was reading books much worse than this when I was probably 12 and hiding them between the mattresses so my mom wouldn't find out). This book focuses on the story of Jessica Darling, a highschool sophomore, whose best friend had just moved away. Faced with dealing with the lose, Jessica gets caught up in the ups and downs of highschool life, including becoming friends with the school bad boy, ousting the in-crowd, and becoming more and more distance from her family.Much of the book focuses on two things: Jessica's infatuation with Marcus the school druggie and Jessica's virginity. There's a lot of references to drugs and sex throughout the book (very typical of the high school experience today). While the book deals with the issues in a mature and sensible way, I can understand why my local Borders had this book listed among the adult fiction. All in all, this was a good coming of age novel, one that I would recommend to others. Super sarcastic fun I'm 32 and this seems a little young, I couldn't get into it. I guess I should have paid more attention to the target audience age. Not my thing",

         "I bought this book thinking it was actually 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch', which we originally checked-out from the local library. Unfortunately, this book only features part of Owney's fascinating and almost unbelievable travels...and the pictures are only sketches of the original photographs that are in the other book. Over all, I was really disapointed in this re-telling about Owney. The details are just not there, especially after reading the other book. This edition might be good for little ones, like maybe three and up, who can't sit still through a more detailed version, but 'Owney, the Mail-Pouch Pooch' offers the listener a richer version of the story with REAL photographs of who is assumed to be Owney. This book, in my opinion, just doesn't cut-it. Consider the other book instead. A book about a book??? This is a fun book for kids, and since it's a true story it adds a little history as well. Very nice illustrations. I do wish, tho, that children's books were listed with a suggested age range. This book seems right for a 5 to 9 year old, and I was shopping for a book for an older child. I've played this guessing game with Amazon for other children's book purchases, so I hope somebody hears this! The Ownie book, tho, was so darned cute I'm keeping it for a different child who will be old enough for it soon. Hmmm...I wonder if Amazon gets me to buy more books this way...

         "This Place Of Men",
         "This place of Men is an awesome story. Doug Cooper-Spencer proves that he is as great a writer as his contemporaries E. Lynn Harris and James Earl Hardy. The characters in this book are most captivating and the story pulses to an unexpected climax. My only disappointment is that I have to wait for another Cooper-Spencer book. I give this book 5 of 5 stars. Awesome Book! Embarking on a journey to reestablish a life that was almost ruined is never easy, especially in a town where it all happened. In \"This Place of Men\", Author Doug Cooper-Spencer takes you on this journey through the eyes of Otis, who returns to his hometown of Cincinnati, a place he had never returned to ever since being falsely accused of the statutory rape of his teenage sweetheart Terrell. Even though it is twenty years later, both men realize they still have inner demons that they must face before facing each other. For Otis, it was confronting his father who turned his back on him when he needed him the most. For Terrell, even though married with children, it's dealing with the reality of his true sexuality. A reality that he not only didn't have the courage to face up to as a teenager, but also brought on the downfall of his lover, Otis.Doug Cooper-Spencer carefully brings you into the complex life of both men, showing how ones past shortcomings can affect the others future. Terrell, a husband, father and successful accountant for his church, while Otis who was clearly struggling through hard times living homeless in the streets of New York City. Though now back in the same town, these past lovers are clearly living in two totally different worlds. However, Doug Cooper-Spencer slowly brings their worlds together by revealing a commonality both men have other than their sexuality.A lot of us could really indentify with Terrell, due to his strong religious upbringing. There are a lot of young gay black teens, to this day, who are struggling with the pressures of growing up in households just like Terrell's. Many may have a hard time coming out or may not come out at all. Most may even end up like the characters such as Stanton and Jerry; married men who can only partake in exclusive parties that cater to men like them who feel the need to give in to their homosexual inhibitions.GBM Book Club believes that this is a book that every gay black man needs to read. Doug Cooper-Spencer opens your eyes to the fact that as gay black men, we need to be conscious of the decisions we make in our lives. We cannot close our eyes to every little thing and take it for granted. Otis is an unfortunate example due to Terrell's parents waiting for him to turn eighteen in order to accuse him of statutory rape. If Otis had the right mind-set to take careful precautions, or if Terrell had the courage to speak up, Otis doing time could have definitely been prevented. Even in reality there are so many of us that are either doing time or suffering the consequences of a mistake we made along the way. And until we make right and conscious decisions and have the courage to speak up for one another, we will never find our place. But if you want to embark on a journey that will lead you down the right path, then by all means we encourage you to read and discover \"This Place of Men\". GBM BOOKCLUB Twenty years ago, two teenage boys, Otis and Terrell, fell in love, physically acted on that love, and suffered very different consequences for their demonstrative affection. Otis is incarcerated for his part while Terrell is sentenced to the even crueler punishment of a churchified exorcism of his wicked ways and a false marriage to an always-suspicious wife, an outward ideal, replete with two beautiful children, that belies the rot within the lie he and they live.Set in a close-knit Cincinnati community, where everyone knows everybody's business, whether they admit it or not, Otis, having served his sentence, followed by nearly two decades domiciled in the anonymity of New York City, makes a prodigal return home.Both men, older, not that much wiser, and still with deep, but oppressed feelings for each other, hopelessly resist that inevitable meeting, sparked on by beautifully rendered remembrances sprinkled throughout this mournful tale of innocent love damaged by societal condemnations and recriminations as sad, hypocritical, and emotionally crippling as anything out of Seventeenth Century Salem without the literal stake burnings.Doug Cooper-Spencer's \"This Place of Men\" is a bittersweet tale of love dashed against the rocks of a recalcitrant river of intolerance. It is a mildly enjoyable read that teases with all the elements of grand opera--reflective arias, sweeping dramatic movements, narrative orchestrated with cascading arpeggios, gentle pianissimos, and thunderous fortes, strings and brass, woodwinds and kettle drums--but, alas, the author's use of all the instruments he's brought to the concert hall are tentative, therefore less effective as they could be.The story promises great passion upon which it does not always deliver, which tends to disappoint considering the rich possibilities engendered by the very idea of two innocents in love being robbed of their happiness, and living for so many years with all the unfair consequences visited upon them by hypocrisy, bigotry, and the greatest cut of all, polite indifference.When it comes to the narrative, author Cooper-Spencer is just fine, at times poignant, but he is constantly hamstringed by a lack of emotional boldness and dialogue that has not been pruned of its ordinariness, that remains unadorned, oftentimes not compelling the reader to discover character through the clues shrewdly and compellingly left by things said.\"This Place of Men\" takes a long time getting around to its reveal and ultimate d&eacute;nouement, and when they are finally shown--why Otis was incarcerated, what happens when these two men meet after all these years--we wonder if the set-ups were worth the wait.Nonetheless, there is much to admire about this brooding meditation that at least harkens toward self-love in spite of society's oppressive attitudes. That is its boldness.Also, we are left with a sense of hope by the last page, which could easily spawn a sequel. I encourage Mr. Cooper-Spencer to make sure part two contains sharper dialogue, stronger conflicts, and a busier red pencil. THIS PLACE OF MEN",

         "I have read every book I could find on home organization and \"clutter-busting\". This book is the first one that contained practical, truly helpful information. We are preparing for our second child and just finished a remodel so I really needed some workable tactics to get our home in order. I carried this book around the house with me, consulting it as I went from room to room trying to figure out what to do with an overwhelming accumulation of \"stuff\". It has taken a couple of months, but the recommendations I implemented from this book are now paying off. I know where everything is, I have made a lot fewer \"necessary\" purchases and the house is a lot easier to clean up on short notice!This book also has the gentle guidance you need when trying to cope with your emotional attachments to your possessions. This book isn't full of intimidating, glossy photos of perfectly organized rooms. Instead, it is full of information you will use on a daily basis to both clean up your space and keep it that way. Best of its kind This book does the job and does it well. The authors' experience is evident throughout. Written clearly and efficiently, the book has many practical suggestions about all aspects of downsizing. In addition, it is written with humor and a real understanding of the practical and emotional stresses that downsizing, a major life event, present to those involved and their families. The book is now over 5 years old, but everything in it is still current. Strongly recommended. Well done.",

         "Who Wrote the Bible?",
         "This book is a must-read for all bible scholars including: jews, christians (denominational or not), or anyone else interested in the hebrew bible.The hebrew bible finally makes sense after reading this book! I no longer see paradoxes, mysteries, and confusions in the bible, but understand why certian contradictory statements exist in the bible. This is because this book examines not only who wrote the hebrew bible, but in what religio-socio-political climate it was written. At the end of the book, the reader understands much more than &quot;who wrote the bible,&quot; but actually understands HOW and WHY the bible was written. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the bible. More than just &quot;Who wrote the bible&quot; This is an excellent book. In it, the author tells the story of how he and others before him unraveled the mystery of who wrote the books of the Old Testament. It is a compelling tale, and a fascinating one for anyone interested in this subject.In a nutshell, (spoilers ahead) it has been revealed that the Old Testament consists of four compilations written by four different authors at different times with diverse, and often contradictory, agendas. After the first compilation, the others merely built upon it and revised it to suit their agendas. For instance, a later author might come along and, unsatisfied with how the earlier author presented his people, his faction, or his ancestors, rewrite and rework the earlier work to present his group more favorably. Often, the incentive was economic, i.e., if the author was a priest of a particular group, he would write the compilation so as to denigrate other competing groups of priests and require the people to come to his group for sacrifices and other services for which the group received income. Ultimately, and ironically, someone combined these competing compilations together into what we now know as the Old Testament, leaving many unresolved conflicts and outright contradictions.After reading this, I don't see how anyone could maintain that the Old Testament is \"literally true,\" for how is it that God would commission four contradictory retellings of the history of his people and then have them combined in such a way that leaves the vast majority of the contradictions and inconsistencies? In many places, one story cannot be true if another is true. They cannot all be true.Furthermore, it seems impossible that the Old Testament could be divinely inspired at all, for the same reason. Even if only the first compilation (J) was divinely inspired, it would seem that God would be able to prevent the subsequent bastardization of his word by combining it with the subsequent accounts into what has become the basis of Judaism and Christianity. The fact that Jesus accepted the truth of the Bible as written and the prophecies contained therein casts enormous doubt on any claim that Jesus could indeed be the Son of God (if he even existed).The author does not carry his work to these logical conclusions, for obvious reasons, but they are the only conclusions one can draw when one has completed this book.Overall, I highly recommend \"Who Wrote the Bible.\" At a minimum, this is \"must read\" material to anyone that considers the Bible to be the source of his or her religious faith. Even those that don't should learn about the history of this amazing book, which is perhaps the most influencial of all time. Outstanding story of one of the greatest mysteries of our time I write this to an audience that believes Monotheism was an advance in the theological system of the ancient Near East. I personally believe in Reincarnation, but have trouble melding this belief with multi-deity religions. With this personal introduction, I offer that this book is an outstanding literary work. It is easily readable. Unlike many texts on religious literature, it is clear, precise, and most importantly, very enjoyable reading. It addresses questions any reader of the Bible has regarding duplication of it's stories and obvious contradictions. More importantly, this book illuminates the faces and lives of the several individual people who actualy composed portions of the Bible, giving them personalities, and showing their perspectives, personal agendas, and prejudices. The thesis is developed well and the conclusions are enjoyable, if not ironic. The Appendix divides the Bible into proposed authorship, allowing for comparison to other authorship theories. Most importantly, this book gives a glimpse into the literary and spiritual process that led to Monotheism. A great work. The Great Treasure of Monotheism I found this concise, well written book surprisingly interesting and engaging. The author reveals that the Old Testament is comprised of works by several writers created at different points in time that have been woven together to create the current version of the Bible. The biblical authors are framed in their historical context to aid the reader in understanding their particular perspective. This is a scholarly work written to speak to all interested readers. Very Interesting and readable, explains many Biblical puzzles I found Friedman's hypothosis to be far more compelling, rational, and just plain interesting than the teaching on the origin of scripture that I grew up with. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in taking their knowledge of scripture beyond the Sunday School stage. Compelling This is an excellent book for those who want to deepen their knowledge about the Old Testament. It was written in a simple language that can be understand by those who are not scholars. Excellent Book Richard Friedman synthesizes hundreds of years of critical biblical scholarship and presents it in the crisp style of a can't-put-it-down detective story. He presents fascinating--but technical--information in a compulsively readable, non-technical format. This book is the definitive starting point for any lay person interested in how the first five books of the Bible were put together.The real history of these books may be more complex than what is presented here, but Dr. Friedman presents a strong case in support of general authorship by the usual suspects of critical biblical scholarship--slippery individuals known primarily by their aliases: J, E, D, P, and R.My only complaint is with the name, &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?&quot; This name suggests that authorship of the entire Bible will be assessed. Instead, however, the inquiry focuses exclusively on the first five books of the Old Testament (known as the Torah or Pentatuch). The book does not address the authorship of the other books of the Old Testament or of any of the books of the New Testament. Even so, it's a great read. A fascinating detective story First, note that Friedman's \"Bible\" is the Christian \"Old Testament.\" For equally good books about the New Testament, look up the works of Hyam Maccoby and Burton L. Mack.Second, \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" took me back to my undergraduate classes in the Old Testament, refreshing my memory regarding such issues as the Documentary Hypothesis, but going beyond with the latest scholarship (a lot has happened in the last twenty plus years!) I can't say enough good things about this book. Brought me back \"up to speed\" and then some on the Bible. Friedman's &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?&quot; is a good book that explores the documentary hypothesis quite well. It is easy to read and interesting. However, a more compelling and convincing argument about the authorship of the first book of the Bible can be found in &quot;The Genius of Genesis&quot; by Dennis Shulman. Read both of these books if you want a more balanced perspective on the questions Richard Friedman and the modern biblical scholars raise. Good Book About the &quot;Good Book,&quot; and a Recommendation This is the best introduction to the JEPD hypothesis available. So if that's what you're after, this is your book. If you're going to study it thoroughly and carefully, I recommend keeping a good Bible handy, especially the Oxford Bible, which is the best for scholarly (non-denominational, non-devotional, non-theological) study.If you are reading the Bible simply for scholarly or literary purposes, a book like this is great.I recommend following this one up with a book like \"The Bible Unearthed\" by Finkelstein and Silberman, which deals with archaeology rather than textual investigation; and I strongly recommend reading a couple books by Hershel Shanks. After just this short reading list, you'll be able to digest even the most scholarly work on the Hebrew Bible, by folks like Mark Smith.But if you are looking for help reading the Bible as an element of your religious devotion, this book is probably not what you're looking for. Basically, modern scholars try to discover what the texts meant when they were written, rather than what they might mean to us. That takes a lot of irreverent detective work, and believers are usually uncomfortable, often defensive, when they encounter critical scholarship.HOWEVER - this is a big one - I honestly believe that the Biblical texts get much richer when critical scholarship is coupled with traditional and modern interpretations. The first chapters of Genesis provide a great example. Modern scholarship offers a lot of insight into what those stories (might have) meant to their original writers and audiences, and what they meant to later editors as well. We discover the spirituality of the ancients that has been hidden beneath more recent interpretations.Now you don't have to throw out your tradition's more recent interpretations. Although you might choose to do that, most traditions have a lot of other theological options.So, this is a long way of saying that if you read the Bible devotionally, then sure, modern scholarship will probably be challenging to your faith. But I encourage you not to put your head in the sand: find out what the scholars are saying. If, ultimately, you simply have to disagree and take a defensive stance, at least you'll know what you're up against. But probably, despite some struggles, you'll come to a much greater appreciation for the human authors of your scriptures, and for the depths of meaning hidden in the scriptures themselves. Not only that, but when you learn to see the scriptures from different perspectives, you'll probably learn a lot about your own tradition. best introduction This book is a must read for anyone who has either read or plans to read the Bible or the Torah. This book gives you a good base too start from. Must Read",

         "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet A. Jacobs: A True Tale of Slavery, by John S. Jacobs",
         "I enjoyed this book. It was a real story from how it was long ago for this woman. It is a long book, but it is worth it! Great book! Awesome read, could not put it down. Highly recommend for anyone, any age. The author takes you with her into her experience as a slave and finally to freedom. Book Better than Uncle Tom's Cabin which I found to be a bit of propaganda. This was engrossing and hopeful. Glad I read it. Great story This book is excellent for those who want to know what life was like as a slave. It was very moving to read about her experiences growing up, and the lengths she had to go to to protect herself and her familiy. Highly recommended. Great Book! I really liked this book but I don't like finger pointing slavery was a very disgusting thing and should not have ever happened but all do not white women did not have a easy life either. to much finger pointing I usually read just Christian romance books, but this was recommended to me by a friend, and I have hardly been able to put it down. I have not finished it yet because I don't have a lot of free time to read, but when I do, I pick it up and start reading. It has held my interest from the very beginning. Excellent reading Any one whose primary view of slavery is from Gone With The Wind should read this book. The author does a great job of illustrating the physical and emotional devastation of being considered by law to be owned by another person. A moving historical record The thing that struck me so personally was how this woman knew in her deepest part that the way she was forced to live was not right and that she would push the limits of all possibility to achieve what she knew in her heart was possible. If, like me (a white, middleclass male), you ever deeply felt there is more to life than what is routinely offered, you will identify at this level. Being freed was not enough. She spent the second half of her life working to free and educate other slaves. That is true enlightenment.Her writing is sparse, eloquent and heartfelt. I could blather on and on about how wonderful this book is. If you are unsure about how much racism has wounded the spirit of African-Americans, this book will lay some foundation for that understanding. Knowing there's more to life I have read many books about Slavery in our country. None have effected me like this one. The writer made you live threw her life as she experienced it. I cried and laughed along with her. I predict this book will be the talk at the dinner table when more people discover what it holds between the cover. Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl written by Herself What I particularly like about this book is how easy it is to read through. The southern vernacular dialect is sparse and not used by Harriet/Linda in the book. Further, the retelling of the horrors of slavery are not overdramatized -- it's not necessary to get the reader's attention. The everyday nature of these attocities are evident in the straightforward reporting of the events.The dynamics of the household are fascinating when you read of the jealous mistresses who are infuriated at their husbands' infidelities under their roofs and how they mistreat the slave women who are subjected to their husband's unwelcomed advances.Harriet's Grandmother is a remarkable woman of her day -- she became free and through hard work bought many of her own family members. She was a highly respected member of the community lending money to whites and blacks alike.Survival and freedom for herself and her children is Harriet's objective and her unyielding determination is inspiring.This story tells how difficult it was to be a woman in the south and particularly an attractive woman in slavery simple and straightforward I absolutely love this book. It saddens me immensely to see how human beings can mistreat, abuse and hurt another human being that way no matter what color their skin is. This book tells Linda story and you can feel her pain and misery in each page while her believe in God and the love for and of her family kept her going until she got her freedom. Incidents in the life os a slave girl writen by herself very interesting and means more when written about lifes trials. I ike her style of writting. I would recommend this book. Very good book very interesting and horrifying that we have allowed people to be treated like this! Hope that our genteration can be more helpful to those less fortunate. incidents in the life ofn a slave girl I found this book to be very interesting and factual, for a person who like non fiction books this one is right up your alley. Incidents in the life of a slave girl writtten by herself Written in a true voice, this narrative compares favorably with other slave accounts such as &#34;Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember: An Oral History&#34; edited by James Mellon and available from Amazon but not yet on Kindle. This book is well-written and gripping, and helps us to remember today just how damaging prejudice and intolerance can be. Judy Home Educational and inspiring! I truly did like this book and all the things you can learn from it. However, the editor of this version made several mistakes in putting words together. This made it harder to read than necessary. I recommend this book, but read one produced by a different publisher. Great book, but... I write this review to applaud the courage of this woman. Not only did she live through and experience episodes in her life that no person should ever have experienced; she had the strength to chronicle the episodes of her life. Would this have been an easy task for her to do? She mentions how difficult it was; it is my hope that God has provided her a heavenly place for eternity. She has told her story in a most respectful and very kind fashion considering the fact that animals were treated better than these Black American's were. Certainly another example of man and his capacity at cruelty; at the expense of another human being or race of people. A disgraceful period in the history of this country; one we need to learn from so these atrocities are never permitted to take place again. Determination The book I received has a different cover than the one pictured, but it is the same edition and everything as far as I can tell. incidents in the life of a slave girl A story of a young black girl born into slavery gives the reader an honest insight of a shameful time in America's past. It shows the strength of the human spirit to escape persecution and reclaim life. A wonderful read. Moving and insightful I loved this book. It was a little difficult to read at times due to the language at that time. But overall I wanted to know more of the authors story with each page. Eye opening. incredible story, I felt honored to have been able to read what this woman wrote. Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl I read that the play that was due to run on the day following the assassination if President Lincoln was named The Mullatoe. I have never been one to care for opinion or judgment based on comparative suffering. Within any category, some individuals and sub groupings will suffer more or less than others. I think that people of good will understand group dynamics but attempt to understand and accept the individual viewpoint. The woman who wrote this book was a slave. She was subject to abuse including sexual abuse. She ran away from the slaver who imprisoned her in slavery and she hid herself away for years in a cramped attic space until she was able to flee to Philadelphia. Eventually her two children, also escapees from slavery, joined her. In the North there remained the fear of recapture and especially with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. Harriet Ann Jacobs is the first ex slave known to have written her autobiography.The Library of Congress contains records of What we regard as &#34;white&#34; people who were enslaved. There is a book called, &#34;They were White and They were Slaves&#34; by Michael Hoffman. As I read this book I got the impression that Michael Hoffman was angry that the enslavement of White people was denied, ignored, or minimized because it may have been of shorter duration than slavery involving Black people. It seems Michael Hoffman's work drew so little attention that he had to resort to David Duke and people of similarly extreme views to get a reading for his work. Hoffman did not seem to share David Duke's antipathy toward Jewish people though David Duke would probably argue that he is anti Zionist or anti Israel instead of anti Semitic. I do not credit the distinctions. But I understand Michael Hoffman's ire over the fact that the academic world and the general media minimize or ignore the facts of enslavement of White people. Again, comparative suffering is not a proper framework for understanding though it us a good excuse for fighting.Scientific racism continues to shape the acceptance and discussion of race. It was never a matter of science but always a master if profit, property, and power when it came to race. Northerner a traveling in slave states were often appalled to see White women and children up for sale on the slave block. When the Northerners expressed amazement or if they objected, Southerners would explain that they were slaves who looked White but who had known African ancestry and so were &#34;lawfully&#34; or even mandatorily enslaved. No small amount of Northern anti slavery sentiment was based in the stories of enslavement of people who were indistinguishable from White people. Slaves with light-coloured skin complexion made for more sympathetic skin complexion when it came to building support for anti abolitionism. People who had no traceable African ancestry could be enslaved and this prospect terrified many. Records were often unavailable and ancestry for purposes of slavery could be established by testimony of as few two witnesses. Sexual exploitation was often a motive in slavery.A few academic types theorised that that the author could not have bern a Black woman. This is the same type that denied the reality if Sally Hemmings, an enslaved woman and her relationship with President Thomas Jefferson. Black history has traditionally been lost, stolen, or destroyed. Thus us a great read for this month and a still noteworthy accomplishment and true triumph over adversity for Harriet Ann Jacobs. Unity and Diversity in Oppression This book leaves a black mark (no punn intended) on history in the United States. This should be a text book in US high schools. Let people understand where blacks and whites came from originally, as well as the relationship between the north and the south. A great book, with the depth and breadth of REAL history. Published in 1861, unbelievable at the time by many. This novel is a very important look on American history. An important historical novel I found this book to be very interesting. It explained the abuse and hardships that the slaves had to indure. It was written in such a way that you actually felt that you were going through the difficulties with them. It is so hard to believe that people could treat others in this manner. Thank God that we no longer have slaves here in America. I have three friends waiting in line to read this book. LOVED IT!!! I was delighted to find this title here. I first read it as an undergrad and then later as a graduate student interested in slave narratives. Jacobs gives a highly sensitive insight into the inner psyche of the female slave. This work is not only of great importance as a member of the \"slave narrative\" genre, but also of women's literature in general. It is wonderful to hear the highly femanized yet powerfully strong female voice of our narrator. Would be fantastic as a summer reading project for precocious teens along with Uncle Tom's cabin and Frederick Douglass. Plus, it's just a darned, good read! A must-read slave narrative My wife and I (both senior citizens)found the book both interesting and informative. The main characters were pretty well fleshed out and the action kept moving along pretty well. I would recommend it. It gave a glimpse of a life so different from today. favorable impression There are very real life books about what it was like to be a woman and a slave in the Old South, but this book is a lot more than just a dusty old historical tome. The books offers an unapologetic look at that horrible Southern institution, and details the atrocities, both large and small, committed against these innocents.It can be a tough read at times because of the cruelty of that era, but the slave characters themselves have such an innate human dignity and decency it provides enough light to get you through the really rough patches.An important work and highly recommended. A Unique And Authentic Perspective i had never read this piece despite a degree in English. I think it should be required reading for anyone studying American history. While we will never know the full truth behind this work, the lessons and insights are powerful. I'm glad that I stumbled across this and look forward to sharing it with my children. A must read classic Touching story that follows her through a hard time in history. A must read for history buffs of this time period. touching story I found \"Letters from a Slave Girl: The Story of Harriet Jacobs\" by Mary E. Lyons at a used book sale. I was fascinated by the story. It was in seeking a more detailed and historical account that I looked for a copy of \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" by Harriet Jacobs herself. I was surprised and delighted to find that I could purchase a copy of the text for my Kindle for $1.50. The Kindle version is produced by scanning in a copy of the manuscript. As a result there are quite a few typos. Mostly these consist in the concatenation of adjacent words. Despite these flaws, I found that I quickly adapted, to the point that I hardly noticed them at all.The publication of this book in 1861 has an interesting history itself. Harriet Jacobs was so concerned for the consequences of her publication for those still living amongst her former slave masters that all of the names, including her own, and the locations are changed. In this regard, it is interesting to compare Lyons book with Jacobs, since Lyons' book uses the actual names and locations. The story is an autobiography of Harriet Jacobs life as a slave in North Carolina, and something of her subsequent life as a \"free\" woman living in the North during the days of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Jacob's account of her life under slavery is detailed and somewhat unique, in that it is given from the perspective of a young woman living, not on a plantation, but in town. Her account comes across as something of a page-turner, the reader eager for Jacob's safety and ultimate escape. Because of the suspense depicted in her account, I do not wish to detract from the reading experience by revealing much of the details. For these reasons, I am surprised that no one has, to my knowledge, ever tried to make a movie of her account. The account is brutally honest. No one comes off unscathed, not the white man who helped her children, and especially not Jacob's herself. Perhaps only her grandmother and one white woman who defended her grandmother appear unsullied. Still, we cannot come away from this book without incredible respect for Jacob's character and persistence in the face of overwhelming odds. If you want a close up look of slavery in the days leading up to the Civil War, even in the best of circumstances, I cannot more highly recommend this book. Well written autobiographical account of life as a young female slave Good Book! The only thing that I don't understand is why did they change all the names in this book. The book is very interesting, enough so, that I went to the computer and looked it up and continued the search for the slave girl that I felt so attached to after reading this book, \"It is in the book. The book it is very good and I could read it time and again. If u never felt anything for the Slaves before, you will after reading this book. It brings out only pity for the way that they were treated. Kindle book about a Slave Girl Good overall description of the books, and was delivered in a short amount of time. Good Source I recommend this book to anyone that has felt an outcast. What slaves went through, i could not imagine. How could any human being have the right to own another, is inhumane and ungodly. Cruelty still lingers today with prejudices against anyone who isn't white and something that will always sadly remain. I would have been a refuge to a slave with helping in the underground railroad. Slavery should have never existed. To me, Americans were so lazy in taking care of themselves in that time of slavery. May they burn in hell forever for the cruelty they instilled onto human beings. Review of this book Jacobs was a slave-- and endured unbearable harships to escape the unwanted \"romantic\" attentions of her owner and eventually slavery altogether. Her text, written as an autobiography to prove, in part, that an African American woman could be just as moral and brave as the target audience of white women who were ignoring the slave system as something they had nothing to do with, is a classic of African American literature. The story is interesting, well-written and sometimes as tense as any dramatic nail-biter. This is a historical document as much as it is a good read. This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to know about the US troubled relationship with race, still today and in our past. Another of the most important books you'll ever read... I am in the process of reading the book, it is well written. The words can actually put you in the setting. The narrative is so life like This book did not hold my interest. It was a book I could easily put down and walk away from. Life of a Slave Girl I enjoyed this book. It kept you wanting to read more. It was so real like and informative. Great book very real I rate this book in the top 5 of all the inspirational books I have read. It is a very moving story of the horrors of slavery, by a very courageous and resourceful young woman. It is a real heart tugger, and I could not put this book down until I finished it. Superb story I hope to meet this girl when I cross over after this life. What an example of spunk! Not everyone could have done what she did. She had grit and courage. I would like to punch that so called doctor in the nose. I have never understood slavery-how Christian people could be involved. I would reccomend this read to anyone who likes history and to see someone triumph against all odds. Kindle Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Very informative! It pays never to give up on your dreams! I loved it!!!!! Would recommend to my friends!!!!! Lovely Incidents in the life of a slave girl Harriet Jacobs, as an ex-enslaved female African American, wrote not only one of the first but also one of the most powerful narratives of enslavement. For any reader, of any race, desirous of experiencing something of the horrors of slavery, \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" delivers.Jacobs documents the horrendous treatment she and her fellow enslaved family members endured. Treated as nothing more than chattel, Jacobs repeatedly resisted the lewd advances of her owner. True escape and freedom impossible, Harriet \"escaped\" to a tiny underground hole in a relative's shack. Imagine what it was like for her to \"live\" there for seven years, watching through crevices her children age and her relatives raped.External freedom impossible, her story explores the possibility of internal freedom. In her case, found through her Christian faith and her hope of earthly freedom some day and heavenly freedom one day.\"Incidents\" is mind-expanding, awe-inspiring, and soul-developing. Read it to learn and to change.Reviewer: Robert W. Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\" He has also authored \"Soul Physicians\" and \"Spiritual Friends.\" Awe-Inspiring Here is a surprising find. I had not heard for it before. It is an excellent read and full of insight into the life of slaves and free blacks in the south, north and in Europe in the late middle 19th century.It was not at all what I had expected after the disappointment of Uncle Tom's Cabin a while back. This is an autobiography well worth reading. If you are a history fan, or study women's issues or race relations, you will not be disappointed. Excellent I really enjoyed the book. It's well written and easy reading. It is a window into a time and place I could never imagine. The trials that the main character goes through for the good of her loved ones is incredible. She never gave up her struggles, always seeking a better life, but she never gave up her humanity. A snapshot of a life This book is wonderful. It was so hard to put down at times. Highly recommended. A must read for people of all ages Incidents in the life of a slave girl I am building a collection of African American History books and have found many free books available on line. I appreciate having this one for my tablet.This book is gripping, powerful and beautifully written. It gives you a first hand account of the brutality and inhumanity of slavery. The resolve and will of this women could not be broken. I had to read it in small doses as it brought tears to my eyes many times. Linda was an extraordinary woman who loved God and her family and whose faith brought her through many hardships. I cheered her every success. This book is certainly worth the time and is highly recommended. It should be a must read in Language Arts classes. Painful to read, yet hard to put down This story reveals the joy and pain of a woman who lived her life in slavery. The suspense holds you until the end. Highly recommended - t Well told story I plowed through this book in only a few days. It was well written and interesting. Definitely worth the read when its free!! Good read, especially for the price. Free! This book is hard to put down, and hard to pick up. Dramatic recall of her life as a slave and her escape. I love this book and recommend it to anyone wanting to know the truth about life as a female slave. Excellent Slave History Wow!!!! I read this brilliant slave narrative about 15 yrs ago in college but it never left my heart. One of the few books I refused to resell to the college bookstore! A definite must read!... 12/24/12 its 20 yers now, I think I will reread this over the holidays... The story of linda bent Often taught along side Frederick Douglass's Narritive of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl offers an important incite into the abuses that female slaves faced. While Douglass's narrative stresses house slavery emasculated male slaves, Jacbos shows how slavery robbed female slaves of their womanhood. Jacobs' alter-ego, Linda Brent, was never physically beaten, like Douglass; the horrors of slavery for her were sexual horrors. Linda must try to ward of the sexual advances of her master while simultaneously dealing with the sexual jealously of her mistress.This text is important because it shows how the experience of slavery was gendered and how the experience of womanhood was different for people in different classes. Linda's mother, grandmother, and first mistress all believed in the cult of true womanhood, a prevelant ideology in mid-nineteenth century America that said that women should be \"pure, pious, domestic and submissive.\" Linda was raised with these ideas, but failed to live up to them. While Linda feels shameful and guilty for failing to live up to the standards of the cult of true womanhood, she realizes that slave women cannot be judged by the same standards as middle-class white women because their cultural context is so different. This is, perhaps, the most radical and important message in Jacobs' text.From the time that the narrative was published (anonymously) until the 1980s, the authenticity of Jacobs' narrative has been called into question. For over 100 years, scholars and historians assumed that the narrative was false, either ghost written by the editor (Lydia Maria Child) or completely written by her without a grain of truth. Thanks to the work of historian Jean Fagan Yellin, we now know that the narrative was written by Jacobs herself and that all the major events in the narrative are true. There is no reason why this book shouldn't be read as an authentic slave narrative. An Important Perspective on Slavery I rarely write review to books I read. Notwithstanding, this particular book bet the differ. As I ready this book over the course of a week, my heart weeps. Sorrow the human soul can handle yet come out smiling. Harriet wrote this book to inform us tribulations and triumph of human soul. To learn from yet looking around dread and suffering yet lingers. WEEP! How much sorrow can the heart dwell on Anyone interested in the history of slavery, indeed general American history, should not fail to read this book. Very, very interesting, easy to read, a page-turner. Freed metisse slave's compelling autobiography! I thoroughly recommend this book. It is alternately heartbreaking, heartwarming, scary, but above all- REAL. It is Very well written. Let us NEVER forget the past, lest we repeat it. This woman's story had me on a roller coaster, and that's a century later and simply reading her story. I can only imagine what she, and so many others, went through during these times. Yet this book is penned with skill, dignity, humility, faith, and stark honesty and reality. Don't miss this- it is very worth your time. A Great Read, Real, Sad yet Triumphant Very eye opening and touching. My heart goes out to this writer. What a brave woman. Thanks to her for sharing! Touching Incidents is typically viewed as an outstanding example of Black feminist resistance to slavery as well as a protest against the fugitive slave laws. Yet, it can also be seen as an assessment of the forces available to eliminate slavery as a whole, part of a debate that unfolded in the years leading up to the civil war about what force could possibly overthrow slavery whose ascendancy not only over the South, but over the entire nation seemed unstoppable when this book was written.Its history is a testament to the growth of racism among American literary \"experts\" and historians. While Harriet Jacobs was celebrated in her time as the author of this book and used this celebrity to advance her struggle to advance the lives of refugee slaves during the Civil War and of freed slaves after the Civil War, the racism that followed the imposition of Jim Crow Segregation and the US grab for colonies in Asia and Latin America in the late 19th and 20th Centuries led to the memory of her work being extinguished. By the 1950s and 1960s the scholarly world had come to believe this book was a fiction written by Lydia Maria Child. No one familiar with Child could think that she would do such a thing.We owe Jean Fagan Yellin and her collaborators the honor of resurrecting Harriet Jacob's authorship and career. In a startling masterpiece of research ,Yellin's team documented the truth of everything narrated in this book. We are also enriched by Yellin's recent biography entitled Harriet Jacobs.Besides the usual, Incidents represents a catalog of different ways to escape or lessen the impact of slavery. We have the noble faithful servent in the person of Linda Brent's mother who buys herself with the aid of white who honors her position, we have attempts to escape through the sexual favors of a white man, we have people buying their way out of slavery, we have violent and non violent escapes. We also see Linda Brent's resistence and the success of her clandestine life and later her escapes to Philiadephia, then New York, then England, as a result not only of her individual bravery, character, and devotion to her people and her family and her honor, but of the existence of resources beyond the slave and Black community that can free not only the individual slave but put an end to slavery. We also have the racism that made Jacobs feel not totally free in the North.This is the crucial place Incidents belongs. The publications (Uncle Tom was first published as a serial in an antislavery newspaper and later published as a book) of Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 and 1852 unleashed at the dialog opened among contemporary African American texts about how to eliminate slavery in response to Stowe's great work. Harriet Beecher Stowe had recommended the Christic experience of evangelical Christianity in Uncle Tom, Martin Delany recommended the reculturation of Blacks by a bourgeois independent state's aristocratic and cultural leadership, William Wells Brown pointed to the ship of capitalism coming the vanquish the slave ships.Jacob's text enters this debate with an array of forces within the African American slave and free community, as well as within the Southern white community, as well as the Northern and even international community that can be used to defeat slavery. We have the slaves themselves debating, organizing, and resisting. We have freed Blacks North and South helping. We have whites in the South itself helping, if inadequately. We have supporters of women's rights and opponents of slavery among the women of the North. We have the international opponents of slavery in Britain and beyond.Jacobs highlights not only her own incredibly courageous resistance to slavery, but to the array of forces available to fight slavery. In the weeks and months after this book was published in 1861, those same forces did in fact overthrow slavery and crush it forever more.This is a stirring book written by an articulate and educated writer. Indeed contrary to what is said elsewhere, even narratives written or told by semiliterate African Americans who escaped slavery never contained dialect, but were written in clear standard English. Indeed, scholars have noted that where Jacobs tries to reproduce Black English spoken by unacculturated slaves, she had to fall back on the conventions of theatrical stereotypical imitations of Black English, rather than reproduce real Black English. She had been reared in a standard English environment, had escaped and lived and functioned among an even more stardard English environment, and by the time she wrote this book, almost 20 years after she had escaped from slavery, she was actually unfamiliar with real Black English!Not only was Jacobs literate, but she was apparently very familiar with contemporary Womens or sentimental novels exemplified by Uncle Tom and Susan Warner's Wide Wide World.Jacobs had spent much time in her bondage in Edenton, reading. Later, in Rochester New York, Jacobs ran a anti-slavery reading room associated with Frederick Douglass's North Star. For nearly a decade in New York, Jacobs worked as a house keeper and nanny for one of the most popular journalists in the country. She also knew and received support from her boss's estranbed sister, the widely popular journalist and fiction writer Sara Payson Willis Parton, known by her pen name Fannie Fern. In Ruth Hall, Parton's famous novel a roman A clef biography, Fanny Fern, there isa chacter obviously modeled after Harriet Jacobs. Jacob's maintained an extensive correspondence with some of leading activists in the womens and antislavery movements of her time in both the United States and Great Britain.Incidents follows the styles and conventions of the sentimental novels so well that for decades many believed that it was actually a novel written by a white female sentimental author, not by a escaped slave. The Sentimental novels whose central work is to create sympathy usually signfied by the reader's tears, by the suffering, the righteousness, and ultimately the lack of physical power in a wicked world for its heroines and heroes. To that extent, they reflected the lack of social power and opportunity for liberation of 19th Century women.Jacobs has a totally different approach, remarkable given these conventions. Susan Warner, author of the first big blockbuster novel, Wide Wide World, could make a day in the life of a 10 year old girl seem like a life of torture. Yet, Jacobs forgo the obvious, easy opportunity to dwell on Harriet Jacobs's undeniably extreme suffering hiding in an attick. Instead the book focuses on her spirit of resistance, the availability of allies, and the real possibilities for her deliverence through her own power. Rather than the isolated slave mother locked in an attic, Jacob's Linda Brent is a person who is helped in her struggle by white and black, free and slave in Edenton, helped by sailors and antislavery activists up and done the US coast and in Canada, and helped by people as far away as England. Rather than a victim who deserves our tears, Jacobs shows how there are forces to help her fight for freedom, and she wins.If in the weeks and months in 1860 and early 1861 when this book was written the slave power seemed unstoppable. Yet, the power, the ability to act, the ability to defeat slavery shown in Jacob's book, discloses the forces and the will that would abolish slavery forever in a few brief years. Component forces of the Civil War Revolution Fascinating to read this story from a slaves point of view. You get a very different look at what daily life was like then. Started slow but then I couldn't put it down I thought this would be truly interesting, but found that it was very boring and poorly written. I was sorely disappointed. Boring This book has every emotion locked inside of it. While reading the book I could vividly imagine what was happening and feel like I was there. Great Read There are so many better written reviews that I cannot better but I could not stop from adding how important this memoir is for all Americans to read and get a small glimpse of the suffering and degradation that slavery brought to our country. We owe so much to our African-American citizens to begin to make it right for their loss of freedom, the loss of family members, the loss of everything that we non-blacks take for granted.It is hard to imagine what everyday life was like for a slave but the author Jacobs tells it in such un-elaborated language that it chills my heart. It took me a long time to finish because it is so intense.Harriet Jacobs lived in an Anne Frank-like cellar that was much smaller, much more inhumane, just to keep her freedom and life. Others died rather than submit to the degradation of being subject to named and unnamed torture. I am ashamed in 2011 that this happened. My ancestors arrived in the US after slavery was repealed but perhaps they would have participated also, there is no way to know. It was a way of life in the south.What would we do if faced with a situation like slavery today? Would we risk our lives trying to escape to freedom? If we were one of the master class would we speak out or hide a runaway slave as one of the townswomen did? At risk of your husbands job or your own reputation? Back in those times reputation was very important.Harriet Jacobs voice speaks as clearly as a 21st Century woman, her writing is not \"old\" or \"antique\". What happened to her and to all slaves brought to this country should never have happened. When you read this book it will change you. should be required reading in college A look at slavery from the slaves point of view. Maks you wonder how people can be so cruel?? A couragious herone that refused to give up and finally triumphed dispate major chellanges. Kept me reading. Intereting & painful reading This is a gripping story of a bygone era. Jacobs writes in excellent English (with the help of Maria Child, an abolitionist) and makes you feel you are living through her ordeal together with her.I have learned a few bizzare things through this book. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 allowed slave owners to track down their slaves even in the \"free\" northern states. A slave could \"buy him/herself\" from his/her owner to gain freedom! I always knew money could buy (almost) everything, but it never occurred to me someone might need to buy oneself.It was also interesting for me to see how attitudes of slave owners to their \"property\" could vary so significantly. Some treated slaves as part of the family. Most however cared for them as you would care for a dog: you feed them and call a doctor if needed, even go to the same Church, but never consider them humans. read and live through a slave's ordeal as seen from her own eyes Seeing Linda's life through her eyes shows that God continues to work in strange ways. How fortunate we are. I am grateful that her message is still being read. Linda's life I tried this book as a new user of the kindle and have greatly enjoyed the story of Linda and her family in their struggles for emancipation. She writes with a rhythmic and poetic grace that gives a realistic view of old fashioned and out dated ideas and laws. The brutality and viciousness of slave owners and their followers is graphic and harrowing and yet stated so matter of factly from the weary view of someone who has witnessed and been a victim of these horrors as a normal and frequently practiced solution to controlling and owning a people. A sad and stunning tale This is a great read!It has suspense and emotion tinged with history . Very enlightening and educational. Tells the untold truths of this era. Excellent ! Fast shipping, book was in excellent condition except for a dent in the cover. Brand new. I have a lot of time now to read this before classes start. Woohoo! Fast shipping VERY interesting and different perspective on a slaves life...Hard to believe this really happened, yet you still believe the story... Great book",

         "The Lena Baker Story",
         "The story of Lena Baker, the first and only woman to be executed legally in the state of Georgia, needed to be told.Lena was an impoverished Black woman who lived in Cuthbert, the seat of Randolph County, in southwest Georgia. She lost control of her life because, in addition to her station, of two facts. A prominent white man insisted she be his mistress, and she was dependent on alcohol.When she killed her oppressor in self-defense, she was tried for murder. Did she receive a fair trial? Was her case given an adequate investigation? Was she assigned a competent defense attorney?The exploration of these questions makes Phillips's The Lena Baker Story an absorbing one, but even more engaging are the minute details the reader learns of small-town, Southern life in the 1940s. We are told what is playing at the movies. We know that one Cuthbert resident drove all the way to Eufala, Alabama, to buy her pet bird cherry cokes. We know what most folks had for dinner.This book is highly recommended for its general appeal and to any student of the history of jurisprudence, of the civil rights of Blacks and women, of Americana, or of Georgia history. Lena's Story Needed to Be Told Lela Bond Phillips's recounting of this once forgotten miscarriage of justice is a gripping story well told in its sparse yet lively style covering barely 120 pages. While others would have padded the book with trial transcripts and other ephemera Phillips sticks to the facts of the case painting a warts and all portrait of Lena Baker, the accused murderer and her relationship with Ernest White, the victim. Phillips is unsparing in the depiction of the events leading to the murder as well as well as providing background information on all the major characters as events unfold. Phillips does an outstanding job of explaining how the standards of crime scene investigation and forensic evidence of the era were not as rigorous as they are now and points out the inherent contradictions in the testimony and evidence presented at trial. Phillips studiously avoids making judgments and is careful to point out that readers should not use contemporary standards to judge the characters and their actions. The unflattering and unemotional depiction of an interracial relationship gone wrong in the Jim Crow South has the potential for overwrought prose, but Phillips keeps that in check, largely due to her writing ability (she has an MA in English). In fact her style of writing is well suited for historical writing even though here she is writing out-of-field.When printed in 1998 this book generated renewed interest in the case and efforts to mark Ms. Baker's grave and obtain a pardon from the Board of Parole and Pardons was undertaken. Those efforts bore fruit on August 15, 2005 when the Board posthumously pardoned Ms. Baker. The pardon is a small consolation as she was electrocuted 60 years ago in Georgia's electric chair; the only woman to be put to death. This book is highly recommended for those interested in exploring the Jim Crow era of the South, Georgia History, and real life crime stories. Phillips's style of writing is very enjoyable and this book is a lively page turner that will give you a better understanding of the times. Rough Justice",

         "Drug Warriors and Their Prey: From Police Power to Police State",
         "This book is an anomaly amidst the typical drug policy literature available. Miller's argument stems from his scholarship on Nazism. He applies Raul Hilberg's \"chain of destruction\" to the current \"war,\" not on drugs, but on drug users. William Bennett was less than secretive about his abhorrence for those who used drugs, especially those \"hard-core users who were too far gone to care about\" - stated differently, the real issue is not the drugs themselves, but the type of people who use drugs. America is full of social problems, e.g. poverty, crime, &c.; problems that most politicians are timid in addressing because of the complexities involved in solving them. Yet, politicians need a platform to stand on and the American public needs a scapegoat. Drug users, that most alien element in the population, according to Miller, are the perfect group to identify, ostracize, confiscate, concentrate, and then annihilate as scapegoats for all the ills in society: in fact this sequence of stages is Hilberg's \"chain of destruction.\" It is from his \"seminal\" study on the Holocaust, later published as: The Destruction of the European Jews, that Hilberg constructed his theory of the chain of destruction. Nazi Germany, like America, was in the throes of profound social discord and the public demanded a scapegoat. The Jews became the literal manifestation of a scapegoat for the German people. Hitler, faced with harsh social problems, exercised his own prejudices to isolate, blame and thus use the Jews as a scapegoat for Germany's problems. It was identification of the scapegoat with a real entity and the eventual acceptance of this scapegoat by a German majority that led to the conceptualization and employment of a \"final solution\" for the riddance of social ills from German society. Miller's argument is provocative, to say the least, in that he sees a direct correlation between the processes of Nazism and the processes of the \"drug warriors.\" Moral indignation when it is directed toward a highly specified group of people can have disastrous consequences. Miller is not the only scholar who has applied the scapegoat theory to drug users in American society, but he is the first to take it to its disturbing, but logical end. An anomaly in Drug War Policy literature, and that's good... I would like not to see the parallels. Any rational and compassionate person should like not to see the parallels. But the parallels are there, and Miller lays them bare in this devastating and meticulous extended analogy.This is an astonishing book. Its thesis is provocative, to say the least, and it may not be for everyone -- but if you've ever wondered if just maybe our current federal drug policy wasn't delivering quite what you'd hoped, crack this book open and prepare to lose sleep. Chilling and essential",

         "Generals fight the last war. In the last war they were lower ranking officers in charge of troops actually doing the fighting. This gives them a lesson in how wars are fought. Most United States troops are skilled in the fighting of conventional wars. They well understand what the M-1 tanks did in Gulf War I, they understand about air power, logistics, all kinds of things that enable a heavily mechanized army to fight. They proved this well when a much smaller force quickly overcame the much larger Iraqi army in Gulf War II.Unfortunately winning on the battlefield in Iraq and in Afghanistan didn't mean the end of the war. Instead, as we all know, the real battle was just beginning, and we haven't done very well with it.Dr. Rothstein, a West Point graduate and a thirty year career Special Forces officer uses this book to explain how unconventional warfare has not received the attention it should in the modern military. He uses the experience in Afghanistan to illustrate the points he is describing and makes several recommendations as to how the unconventional forces of the US need to be improved, mostly at the command level.

         "First, for Roger in Las Vegas...if your review is for real, and you went around dressed as a ninja, you were asking for it.For the fellow in Seattle...sorry to hear that. In the US, 75% of the time a martial artist goes to court, they lose. Public perception (even in cases of self defense) is, \"That karate guy didn't have to beat up that guy (or guys) so bad.\"As for the book, a most interesting history lesson indeed. As for the techniques in the book, as a reviewer stated here no one is going to become a fighter by reading a book about it.I did find the illustrations (pencil sketches) most interesting in that quite often the victim is made to look like a Crusader with a huge cross on his shirt. Unlike other martial arts books, the knife techniqures are also illustrated with the knife being plunged into someone's body. There's no doubt the illustrations are to teach Islam's view of all \"infidels\" along with the techniques. If you don't think so, check out the illustration of the captive in a cage or box, and the assassin standing over him holding a knife....and the captive's head.(The only other time I've seen such ilustrations was in a translated KGB manual and victims were shown in US Army uniforms, with 1st CAV. Div. patches).I will say this for the book- at least it doesn't start out with 25 lapel grabs and other such things geared for 1800's Japan. In comparison to the run of the mill martial art book, it's a book on bare-handed assassination techniques and knife techniques. We are definitley not talking \"dojo ballet\" here.

         "Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays",
         "This book is written in a very clear and engaging style. Though parts of some of the essays require some background in philosophy, the issues tackled (such as feminism and multiculturalism) are relevant to anyone who cares about the cultural and intellectual life of this country. very good book Susan Haack is a pragmaticist. Don't let the label fool you. Notice I wrote pragmatICIST, not pragmaTIST. The difference, you ask? Well, in contradistinction to Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnams 'pragmatism' which stresses anti-science and devalues terms like 'objectivity' and 'truth,' Haack is a philosophical descendent of Charles Peirce and John Dewey (begrudginly, I'll throw William James' name in, but that's a stretch). These essays are brilliant defences of the pragmaticist vision of truth, scientific method (or, if we like, methods) and objective knowledge.If all that sounds too philosophical to the average reader, it most likely is not. Haack writes with a down to earth style, a sparkling British wit and a very even flow; especially considering the complexity of some ideas expressed in these pages. It should be mentioned though that although topics covered in these essays include multiculturalism, feminist epistemology, sham reasoning and relativism, this book is much more philosophical in nature than others. Haack is not just another author throwing down the 'science wars' gauntlet (not that it hasn't been thrown down enough already). Whereas most books attacking the abuses of feminism, relativism and postmodern thinking in science, while rightfully exposing their disasterous consequences, end up more as social commentary than actual reasoned arguments; and nary a philosophical arguemt is launched. This is precisely the void that Haack so flawlessly fills.Highlites include a brilliantly constructed 'panel' discussion between 1800's pragmaticist Charles S. Peirce and modern neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty. Haack constructed the dialogue using exerpts of their work and she does a beautiful job making it feel like a discussion. Also, the essay 'Puzzling Out Science' and 'Science as Social' do an excellent job showing that science (contrary to the old Baconian and new 'pragmatist' thought) can be both social and individual. The last two essays deviate a bit from the underlying sceince theme, tackling affirmative action and the absurdities of the academy's expectation that professors (along with masters and doctoral students), to achieve noteriety, must argue the most outlandish theories in the most outlandish way. True to form, these essays are not blank social criticisms so common in books today but are well reasoned, philosophical explorations. The only problem with the book is one common to essay collections. The essays tended to repeat themselves from time to time, not only in ideas (towards the end, you WILL be predicting what Haack's next line will be) but in phrasing. Save for that, flawless! What Pragmaticism was supposed to be!!!",

         "Had purchased this guide over 30 years ago and it's just as inspirational now as it was then. A must have for women in a recovery program of any kind . Love having it on kindle and iPhone so it's always available. Great Funny thing is that this book was on a freebie table at my seminary, about six or eight months ago. I'm not in recovery, not in the 12-Step program, but I have people in my life who are. Along with a book called \"200 Morning Prayers\" thatI picked up in Bangalore in January, I find \"Each Day A New Beginning\" a great way to start and pace my day. Will be ordering it for Christmas for some of the people on my Christmas list. Good Stuff I received this book as a gift years ago and it is the most inspirational book in my library. I frequently order Each Day as a gift for friends, family, and coworkers as a source for reading and reflecting on eternal truths. Inspirational!!! What a wonderful little book this is! A friend gave me a copy back in 1988 when she and I were both trying desperately to patch up marriages that had been damaged by our respective husband's abuse of alcohol. I will forever be grateful to her for this gift. The book is not just for women struggling with addictions...it is for all of us who think there is no light at the end of the tunnel.In the beginning, I read a page each night. After awhile I moved on with my life and felt no need to read it. As I have proceeded with my life I have referred to this book each time life seemed bleak, and every single time I have turned to that day's message...it has been EXACTLY the message I needed to hear to make me feel better.I encourage you to purchase this book for yourself and the women who mean a lot to you...and to let its messages become part of your lives. You WILL be better for it. Some days you will find that the messages are obviously directed at women who are recovering from addictions...it doesn't matter...you will still find a sentence in that message that will be worth a pause in your day. Each Day a New Beginning It is a very spiritual guide for beginning one's day with words of wisdom to ponder. I highly recommend this book Dee The reading in this book are always just what I need that day. I am buying them to pass on to my girlfriends. Just the inspiration I need. This quiet meditation book, has served countless recovering women since innitial printing in 1982. The author, who recieved her Ph.D from the University of Minnesota, was inspired to write the text while working for the Hazelden Treatment Center. She recognized that a woman's recovery can be based on other factors than those that apply to men; and wrote a text for a womens audience.

         "Wonderful book on Christ & the atonement. I've never been so personally compelled or moved by any book before. Especially meaningful to me, were the parts about how important one's reaction to being mistreated or abused are. For the first time in my life, it seems possible to forgive some of the things that have happened to me. This is a must read for any Christian, but I think especially for anyone who's ever been abused. (not to imply that is the main focus of the book). Most personally changing book I've ever read It started as a story I could relate to. But then it got a little odd, but I pushed through it and it came together and the concept was worth the approach.I thought I understood the atonement, but not like this. There was an example provided that explained the atonement in a completely new way--it was one of those rare occasions where there was a dramatic paradign shift and my traditional understanding was blown away.This new understanding takes away some of the pain for being wronged by someone dear to me and makes it easier to forgive that person. Excellent analogy of the atonement Ferrell does an outstanding job on many levels in this book, yet all angles are about the Atonement of Christ and how to apply it in our lives. First of all, he engages in some very insightful and inspiring scriptural interpretation and gleans life-changing principles (truths about the Atonement) from some unexpected sources -- stories that are often overlooked. Second, he presents them in a framework that is personable to just about anyone and helps the reader to empathize with the characters and their predicament. And third, Ferrell challenges the reader to experience learning of the principles for himself or herself and thus to internalize these principles and become a better person through Christ. I could not recommend too many books more than this one. Very insightful and truly life-changing (and life-saving) I had heard about this book for years but just read it this past month. It was wonderful. I felt the book had many insights into the scriptures that I had never thought about before. I am anxious to apply the principles I learned and let my life be blessed by the change the Savior can bring to me by doing so. Unique Insights Into Applying Scriptures This book is great at showing how gospel principals can be applied to your life. It teaches gospel principles by way of a parable of a middle age couple and their struggles. The book can help you change your outlook on your loved ones. An easy read that is easy to go back to for more. Great way to teach the gospel - written like a parable Great book! It is one of those books that helps you not only want to change to be a better person, but helps you take the necessary actions to do this. Thought provoking book i became a new person overnight. this book helped me understand the true value and meaning of love and forgiveness. eternally grateful. renewed If you have a spiritual nature or are interested in a different approach in further understanding the atonement, I have not read anything that has touched me more. The atonement is illuminated through a unique story line. This is not a doctrinal sermon, it's a story that may teach and/or give new insights. Christ and His Atonement If you currently have anyone in your life that seems to provoke ill feelings in your heart--feelings that perhaps feel totally beyond your control, almost as if they had a life of their own: Then my friends--Look no further! Discovering the &quot;Nineveh-nous&quot; of my heart--not THE OTHER'S heart--changed everything. Look No Further! This book was amazing. It certainly causes one to think twice about judging anyone harshly, creates one to think twice upon reacting to situations as well. It prompted me to dive more into the Old Testament to see how the atonement is applicable in every facet of life. This ranks to be one of my most all-time favorite books. It is worth buying because you will want to read it and re-read it to grasp all of the deep meaning. What an intelligent author who scripts the verses so eloquently. WONDERFUL",

         "Blunder after blunder, didn't grab the high ground, insisting on &quot;Napoleonic War&quot; style frontal assaults. This book gives you the huge risks that Lee was forced to take because the REBELS were already losing the war of attrition. Shaara could knit quite a yarn and with Longstreet, Chaimberlain, Lee, &amp; Hancock, as just some of the characters psyche's he has you delving into you won't put it down till crossing THE END. Desperate REBEL grasp for victory I had never heard of this book until I looked at the book list for my college class. It turned out to be a great book and when you have a professor teaching you to read critically you realize how intriguing this book actually is to read. I would recommend it for anyone. Assignment for a novel class I am not much of a fan of historical fiction, but I make an exception for this book. Shaara is so effective at recreating the battle of Gettysburg that you often forget that its a novel. The authenticity is absolutely amazing. The book was used as the basis for TNT's superior film &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; and it is easy to see why. Shaara's descriptions are so vivid, they're like screenwriting just waiting to be filmed. Just like the movie, Union Colonel Joshua Chamberlain is the most memorable character. His story, like this book is for anyone who wants to know what it truly means to be an American. Great Historical Fiction amazingly readable for a history.very hard to put down. the only downside is appearace of maps on original Kindle. don't miss this. GREAT I have little to add to the raves but this:Despite a good education, I had little other than a cursory knowledge of the Civil War until I read this book, a quarter-century ago. I spent the next five years reading everything I could find on the nation's seminal event.Thank you, Michael Shaara The beginning for a Civil War buff. I cannot estimate how favorably hard-core Civil War buffs would receive this historical novel, but as someone with limited knowledge around historical context, battle strategies, major players, and sequence of events, this book has truly whet the appetite. The book is not packed full of technical details. Rather, it offers an engaging (but not exhaustive) description of events in the battle of Gettysburg, descriptions that are provided from the perspective of several major players (Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Buford). It provides insight not simply into the chain of events that transpired, but also into the proclivities, thought processes, and characters of the Generals that played a major role in these events. The book focuses on the events over a 5-day period, June 29-July 3, 1863. Absolutely brilliant piece of work. I borrowed it from my brother--if/when I return it to him I will be buying a copy for myself. brilliant, engaging This book represents American historical storytelling at it's finest. An absolultely divine page-turner; one of the most profound insights on the Civil War I have read. This book presents history in a compelling manner that is easy to read but still encapsulates the thoughts and emotions comprising the American Civil War. It is beautifully divided into chapters aptly named after the officers they portray. Each character's experiences jump through the reader to give him an understanding of the common themes of the North and the South. Common themes including the reasoning behind the war, specifically slavery or state's rights and family against family, and friend against friend are presented in manner that exonerates the humanity of both points of view. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in American history, military history, American philosophy, or just interesting reading. Historical storytelling at it's finest! This truly is one of the best books I have ever read. The author's ability to humanize people (who have only been historical figures to me) is amazing. Have always been interested in the Civil War, but am now ready to pack my bags and see Gettysburg. While reading the book, I felt I was on the battlefield, taking part. A Wonderful Book Although it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1975, Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels\" (1974) was little-noted when it first appeared. The stature of the book has grown with time. It was used in a television series of the Civil War and in a movie version of the Battle of Gettysburg. The novel has been criticized on various grounds. Sharra's factual account of the battle and the importance he ascribes to Little Round Top can be challenged. Shaara focuses too much on the high command of the two armies and gives too little attention to the soldiers in the ranks. Shaara minimizes the importance of slavery to the conflict. For all these criticisms, this book remains a moving account of Gettysburg. It will continue to introduce many Americans to the Battle and encourage them to reflect and get beyond some of the factual limitations of the book. The book is taught in history and literature classes and properly so as it introduces new generations of Americans to their history. It has also appeared in this relatively new Modern Library edition to replace the old dog-eared paperback. The remainder of this review is drawn primarily from the review I wrote some time ago of the earlier edition.This is an outstanding work of historical fiction. The book deserves the praise it has received. There is much more to this novel than can be captured in any movie or TV series on the Civil War. The book is a fitting introduction to the Civil War and to the Battle of Gettysburg. The book illustrates a lesson too easily forgotten --how fiction, creatively done, has the power to give meaning to fact.The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1 -- July 3, 1863. Although some students of the Civil War tend to downplay its importance to the result of the conflict in favor of the the surrender of Vicksburg to Grant on July 4, 1863, Gettysburg remains a pivotal event in the war. It has been written about endlessly.Michael Shaara's novel is in four large chapters, one for each day of the battle together with an introductory chapter setting the stage. The story is told in sections devoted alternately to the perspectives and roles of many of the leading protagonists: the Confederate Commanding General Robert E. Lee, his \"old war horse\" the controversial James Longstreet, and Lewis Armistead, more of whom below. Shaara also describes the British military attache Freemantle, who was a guest in the Confederate camp during the battle and who wrote an important memoir describing his experience. On the Union side Shaara focuses on Joshua Chamberlain, a bookish college professor from Maine who became the hero of Little Round Top, and General John Buford, the cavalry commander whose actions delayed the Confederate advance at the outset of the battle.There are many excellent historical studies of the Battle of Gettysburg. The most important is the long study by Edward Coddington. Both Steven Sears and Noah Trudeau have written two recent extended studies of the battle. Detailed specialized studies have been written on every aspect of the battle including Buford's role on the first day, Little Round Top on the second day, and Pickett's charge on the third day. These and other works make difficult, challenging reading. It is worth thinking about how such studies differ in intent and content from the novelistic portrayal of the Battle of Gettysburg in \"The Killer Angels.\"The novel gives a vivid picture of each of the three days of the battle, but it is more selective, focused picture than we get in the histories. The novel concentrates on the events on Little Round Top -- the far left of the Union line on the second day of the battle, July 2. The hero is Colonel Joshua Chamberlain and his men from the twentieth Maine who hold of a furious Confederate charge over the boulders of Little Round Top led by William Oates of Mississippi and help save the Union position. Many years after the battle, Chamberlain and Oates would write extensively about Little Round Top and correspond with each other. Some historians tend to discount the importance of Little Round Top to the result at Gettysburg. Whether or not they are correct, Shaara's novel shows the human drama of the battle in the way a narrative history generally cannot. He captures the heroism on both sides at this revered site.The novel also concentrates on Pickett's doomed charge on the third day of Gettysburg. He offers a portrayal of General Lewis Armistead, one the the three Confederate General's serving in General Pickett's division. In the pre-Civil War army, Armistead had been a great friend of the Union General, Winfield Scott Hancock who performed admirably on each of the three days of Gettysburg. Armistead died after crossing the Union line in the charge and, as legend has it, with his dying breath asked for Hancock's forgiveness.The novel form allows the writer to concentrate on specific scenes, as Shaara does well in \"The Killer Angels\", to a degree the historian cannot. The novel also allows the writer freedom to explore introspectively. The novelist may describe the thoughts of the protagonists to a degree that goes beyond the historical record. Sharra exploits this possibility to the utmost. He gives the reader interchanges between Lee and Longstreet, for example, that are entirely plausible, that make them come alive, and that cast great light upon their activities and motivations during the Battle. We see a great deal of Colonel Chamberlain, of course. The reader hears Sharra recreating Chamberlain's innermost thoughts and is encouraged to think about the making of a hero.The novelistic form also allows Sharaa to use characters to express their views of the meaning of the War. Sharaa gives the reader a picture of what both sides thought they were fighting for and invites the reader to think further about the Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg and their significance.This novel will not replace historical studies for those interested in learning more about the Civil War or about the details of the Battle of Gettysburg. But it is a thoroughly admirable novel which captures something of the harshness and the heroism of the War and of the American character. It will give the careful reader a good understanding, or a good way to work through to an understanding, of the events of these three days in 1863. \"The Killer Angels\" will encourage the reader to deepen his or her appreciation of, our country's history.Robin Friedman A Novel of Gettysburg Years before I knew about this book, I saw the movie, &quot;Gettysburg.&quot; It was four hours long and felt as if it were over in an instant. I've rented it three times since then, and finally purchased it. My local book-review club members reminded me about &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; and I purchased it. It was tremendous -- I could hardly put it down, and then my husband started reading it and felt the same way about it. It's interesting that the book, which came first, is so nearly identical to the screenplay. To me, that attests to the quality of the author's writing as much as to the good judgment of the producer and director of the movie. The best book I read in 1997 Excellent book. Wonderful insight into the battle at Gettysburg. As a result of reading this book I have a much clearer perception of the generals representing the north and the south during this conflict. It is also a great read to find out more about the strategy employed by both sides and the lack of agreement in both camps about how these stratageies were to be executed. Much of what I learned in history classes relating to this battle and the civil war in general was contradicted. Written Review Great book and great service. Killer angels arrived in France before I expected, was read and well enjoyed. Thank you, John perfect This is a great book. If you are a civil war buff, it puts you right in the thick of things. It is well written. I highly recommend it. Outstanding book Novelizations of real events usually do not interest me much. I'd rather have the \"non-fiction\" historically researched work instead in most cases. \"Killer Angels\" is an exception. Compelling and fast-moving and thoroughly credible, it is a great introduction to the Civil War for those who have not yet become hooked on the work of historians. Mr. Shaara died too soon, but his son has carried on his peculiar contribution to American history, and done so almost as well as his father did. Remarkable achievement... At times in this wonderful novel the author's narrative approaches the realm of poetry--sometimes I had to read a line several times, so great was its beauty. Don't let the word &quot;poetry&quot; turn you off, however. This is not a ponderous, pedantic novel. It is an absorbing, rich read and a painless source of detailed knowledge about the Battle of Gettysburg. A Beautiful Piece of Writing As Well Oops! I just posted a review for this book under Gods and Generals. Anyways, this is an excellent book that I think that anyone could enjoy. It's been called the best Civil War novel ever written and I would have to agree with that review. Hardly fiction... The Killer Angels was an exciting Historical Fiction Novel based on the Battle of Gettysburg. It focuses on certain people that were important at the battle. I loved this book so muck I bought the whole series. Killer Angels The main characters in this book come alive. As I turned the pages it's as if I could feel the sun beating down on my back in those July days of 1863. I sensed the fear the soldiers must have had as they contemplated the charge that ended the battle. I felt the fatique of Robert E Lee, the humble courage of Joshua Chamberlain, and the pain of Armistead as he lay there dying, thinking of his old friend. If you are wondering about what it felt like to be at Gettysburg, read this book. Men of Honor A MUST READ for all Americans. The Army War College in Carlisle, PA uses this marvelous work as the background for its Staff Ride program on the Gettysburg encounter. The future of both the Republic and the Confederacy hinged on many parts of this battle. I also grew to admire Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain for his quiet leadership and faithfulness to his men, be they from Maine or elsewhere. I have worn out, or given away to friends, at least a dozen copies of this book as hooks into study of this critical period in our history. It belongs in every library and history classroom. Positively Oustanding!! THe Killer Angels makes the battle of Gettysburg come alive for the reader. Shaara takes historical facts and injects the human dimension which makes the novel both educational and a page turner. Highly recommend that people of all ages read this masterpiece and immerse themselves in the most turbulent period of our nation's history. Great book! This was one of the best, if not the best, historical novels I've ever read. I often read books on WWI, WWII, but usually they are histories or biographies. I've wanted to read some books on the Civil War, but I decided to start with a highly recommended historical novel instead of the usual histories. I think this was a good move, because this book really piqued my interest, and it sent me several times onto the Internet to look up several things including maps and biographies about people that were more in depth.Michael Shaara wrote beautifully. It's been a long time since I've read a book with such descriptive phrasing that drew pictures of the battleground. I've been to Gettysburg, since I live in Pittsburgh...Shaara was able to describe how lush and green the farmlands around the area is, and what it is like in summer mornings when dew is on the grounds and fog lies in the trees. The book makes you want to cry when you think of men facing each other in battle, and so many of them actually knew each other on the other side. Readers will spend a lot of time with their heart in their throat reading this book...you are glad our country won't have to go through another war like this one, it was so neccessary but so devastating.I learned so much from this book, so much that I want to learn more. It never occurred to me that the British were thinking that if the South won, they could just come in and take over again like the Revolution had never happened. The men of the South were very courageous, and many of them were not fighting for slavery but for state rights and other reasons. It was much more complicated than I thought. You end up feeling a lot of sorrow for not just the men who were killed needlessly, but for the men who had to send so many into battle, for Robert E Lee who was very ill at Gettysburg, and I ended up feeling bad for the women of the South because I read elsewhere that many young women never married because so many prime young men died in the Civil War there was nothing for them to choose from. It's the same thing that happened after WWI in England.I will be reading more on this topic thanks to this book...(Warning: Book had maps which you can't see on Kindle very well) Beautifully written novel of Gettysburg... Fast delivery, item delivered as described. I would buy from this seller again and recommend this seller to others. Good Seller This novel has no words to describe it...it is truly wonderful. I read it in the 7th grade...before our class fieldtrip to Gettysburg and I loved it so much..I bought the rest of the series. It may look long...but doesn't take long to finish. It taught me a lot about Gettysburg...now I'm like a book on it!! And if you like it...Care to watch the Movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;..Based on the Killer Angels. It is one of my FAVORITE BOOKS =D Remarkable... The Shaara writing style clearly enhances the historical facts and you can more easily comprehend the actual steps in the various confrontations on the battlefields.. This is probably the best I have read on the Gettysburg. Killer angels This is the only book so far I removed from my kindle as I thought it was hard to follow. I finished the book in its entirety but I just didnot like the book the way I thought I would. For one I would liked more on the civil war rather rather than so many pages on all the different generals and their personalities.No right now I donot want the book back. killer angels The Killer Angels provides insight into the very men that shaped our country's history. It stripped away all the preconceived notions of the slave mongering, and morally decrepit Confederate Army. Many characters in this book could simply not fight against their family, even thought they swore an oath at Westpoint to defend the Union. Others merely wanted to defend their states' honor. Others believed that it was their constitutional right to govern themselves that they were fighting for.It is very possible that the underlying cause for the War was slavery, but not because men hungered to own other men as property.I have read some reviews by people for whom this book was required reading, and they have not been fair reviews. I truly feel sorry for anyone who does not have the capacity to understand this fine work of literature. And it is certainly Literature. This book is written so that you may glimpse into the mind of men with great burdens upon them, and makes you one of them. At the end of this book I had a lump in my throat because I feel now I can better understand the enormity of the burden these men faced.Read this book. You owe it to yourself. Whether you are interested in the Civil War, or any war for that matter. This book is an insight into the Humanity of soldiers Recently, I read another great War novel, the Louise Maude translation of Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\". THAT was the greatest book I've ever read. This one is also a sensational read--and I'm not one who is usually into war. Shaara's device of picking a few main characters and following them around is well done. It's an interesting read and totally recommended. I would say my one desire had been that he remind us at the start of every new big chapter which side each of the players are on. Small quibble, kind of like wishing that Gabriel Garcia-Marquez had not named so many characters Arianlo in \"100 Years of Solitude\". Architecturally, A Great Novel If you have the slightest interest in the Civil War, don't fail to read the late Michael Shaara's book \"The Killer Angels\". It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1974.For some reason this book had never crossed my path. It wasn't until Father's Day this year that I was even aware of its existence. My 27 year old son gave me a DVD that had both Gods and Generals and Gettysburg on it. In reading the jacket of the DVD I saw the movie was based on this book. After watching the movie, I headed off to the library. I was not disappointed.This volume shows both the courage and determination of the Union and Confederate soldiers. It examines the story from both viewpoints. You are told the story through the key leadership of the battle. You will read about Robert E. Lee. You will learn what his decisions were based on. You will see why he was so beloved by his army. The book allows you to be present as Lee struggles with decision after decision from his headquarters. You can feel the frustration of Longstreet as he tries to convince Lee that defense is a better choice. You will get a picture of the flamboyant Pickett. You will feel Lee's and Longstreet's frustration with J.E.B. Stuart. I met a new hero in the book - Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin as I read about the 20th Maine Regiment and Chamberlain who with a bayonet charge on Little Big Top held the end of the Union line. Another new hero I encountered was General John Buford. You will experience his anguish as he decides to engage Rebel forces. He knows that he was seriously outnumbered. He is determined to save the only high ground in the area.I was emotionally involved in the book from the beginning to the end. This is the book that blurs the line between historical fiction and creative non-fiction. It is simply great reading. While the movie was good, the book is great. Michael Shaara had the vision, did the research, and wrote one of the best books ever. Thank you! If you have the slightest interest in the Civil War, don't fail to read the late Michael Shaara's book \"The Killer Angels\" Shaara has produced a rare gem: a novel that educates, entertains, saddens, and elightens all at once. His history is sharp and well researched, without sacrificing story or character. Shaara makes historical figures who have often been villified or deified into people. By the end of the novel I had a deeper understanding of the motivations and significance of the Civil War, and its military leaders, than any history class could give me. I wish other writers would take the time an d effort to write character driven books about other great battles in history. If This Doesn't Stir Interest in the Civil War, Nothing Will Shaara's &quot;Killer Angels&quot; stands alone as a great read but when read in conjunction with his son's &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; and now &quot;Last Full Measure&quot;, it takes on even greater significance as a window into the events and persons of our Civil War. For me, it introduced me to Joshua Chamberlain--and I've been in awe of him ever since A must read Michael Shaara takes us through the Battle of Gettysburg in sharp detail from start to finish. Not knowing that Ted Turner's film Gettysburg was based on this book, it became obvious after just a few pages. As I recall, the film is true to Shaara's book. Shaara's characters are presented brilliantly from start to finish; these are the men who defined the course of our nation during this bloody encounter in Pennsylvania. Shaara's novel is a painless way for us to learn about this important event in American history. When all is said and done, Shaara's book reminds us at a time when we sit on the brink of war that, as always, &quot;war is hell.&quot; War is Hell In my opinion Michael Shaara has created a masterpiece that has no equal. He explains in such detail the events of the battle of Gettysburg,But at the same time shows us the people, not just a number on a casualty report but the way the people were when they wern't off fighting and being brave and dying valiantly for what they believed to be right and just. The best civil war novel ever written Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of historical fiction. Michael Shaara's Pulitzer-Prize winning Killer Angels is so good that I make an exception in its case. The book works on a variety of levels, which in my opinion separates it from the rest of the genre.On one level is the story of the battle of Gettysberg itself, which Shaara does an exemlpary job of describing. On another level is the complex interaciton of personalities - characters based on real people, many of whom had been educated together at West Point, served together in peace and war and who were close friends before the Civil War began. A third level uses the battle itself as a microcosm for the Civil War, exploring the various motivations behind participants from both north and south.The book is truly a masterpiece of fiction. The drama created by Shaara's dialogue is enhanced by real events, but the real genius of the story is its many facets. I recommend this book to anyone -serious civil war buff or those simply looking for a good book to engross themselves in. You won;t be disappointed. Fabulous fiction After many years of interest in the history of the Civil War I was amazed to be surrounded by the characters that were there. The lifelike and authentic portrayal of the people and events was wonderful. This novel was an absorbing emotional experience lending some understanding to the question of how so many casualties could have occured in such a short time. Brought the Civil War to life This reads well; I found myself engaged with the action and the characters at all times. Both sides of the conflict were portrayed fairly whether north, south or officers or enlisted men or volunteers. The reader becomes aware of the personal hardship, the thrill of going into battle and the terrible waste of human life. It seemed most of the men saw this as an issue of the states' right to be independent of the national government; but as the conflict continued and they all became farther from their own homes and saw more of slavery in action, emancipation rose in importance. Killer Angels LIke many people, I saw the movie Gettysburg before I read Michael Shaara's book. As much as I loved the film, the book is even better! What I appreciated the most was Shaara's way of showing both the Northern and Southern viewpoints equally. He avoided the politically correct trap of demonizing the South, and instead gave a thougtful explanation of why the South felt it was right in breaking off from the United States and taking up arms in defense of it's lands.Two of my heros from the War Between the States are Longstreet and Chamberlain. this book charts their actions during this campaign is a way that helps the reader understand not just what they did, but WHY they did what they did. Any student of the history of the War Between the States should ready this book for it's study of the characters involved in the conflict. Even though it is a work of fiction, it brings the major players of the Gettysburg campaign alive in a way that no other author has yet achieved.This is an outstanding book, and should be required reading in all college-level American History classes. One of the best novels about the War Between the States Had the opportunity to read this twice before (I was hooked the first time!) With other good books piling up, figured the best way to \"review\" Killer Angels was to listen to it on tape while driving on business. Was not disappointed. Previous comments about the READER had given me some misgivings. And yes, perhaps Lionel Barrymore could have been a wee bit better.....but the reading was top notch and faithful to the story.Noticed just a couple a areas where the story dragged just a bit; this was not apparent to me when I was actually reading the novel. Nevertheless, the entire presentation was a great experience, from the prologue to the epilogue.HIGHLY RECCOMMEND this book, regardless of the format. And after you've read it maybe you'll be like me, and visit both Gettysburg and the Maine home and burial site of Joshua Chamberlain. Third time's the charm I was made to read this in High School and it opened my eyes to historical fiction. One of my favorites. My Favorite Book One of two books read in my entire lifetime that I consider a masterpiece.This book's language is sweet, smooth-flowing, stunning in its simplicity and focus. The Battle of Gettysburg is well documented and has been written about since July 4, 1863..... but to someone unversed in warfare and battlefields, it brought home the bravery, certainty and uncertainty, fear, foolishness, conflicts, nobility, and humanity of the men struggling to survive the 3 days in Pennsylvania that turned the tide of the war.I loved the structure of the novel - alternating chapters among the key figures of the war - Lee, Chamberlain, Longstreet, Buford, Armistead, The Spy, Freemantle. I appreciated the maps, the brief biographical notes at the beginning of the novel and the afterward describing the principal characters lives after the war.I want to learn more about Longstreet and Chamberlain particularly and want to see Gettysburg.I'm not sure I could have appreciated this book at any earlier time in my life so am grateful that I've read it now. Beautifully written and a joy to read The book started out by what seemed like trudging thorugh mud. About 1/3 way through, it started to get very interesting. A worthwile read! Sad throughout, but boring in the beginning Actually, I've been meaniing to review this book for quite some time. This is one of my favorite civil war books.Anyone who was totally confused by the lack of presence of Buford in the movie and who doesn't own the director's cut will find more of his actions in the book.Historically, it is fairly accurate. Of course, only diary excerpts and letters can recount the conversations, etc., and they are usually not exact, word-for-word retellings. Some of the conversations used in the book were taken from retellings by one of the participants. General Ewell and RE Lee, for instance. Others are completely created dialogue. It's impossible to know which if you are not a civil war expert, which I am not.The Killer Angels is a wonderful place to start. Must Read A very good Michael Shaarah book that everyone should read to get a perspective on the Civil War. A Civil War Must This Pulitzer Prize winning novel captures the Civil War battle of Gettysburg from both the Union and the Confederate side in an interesting and informative way. Each chapter forcuses on a General - alternating with the Blue and the Gray. Although I have visited Gettsburg and read much on the Civil War, this particular tale brings it to life in a gripping way that is unmatched by any other. You will love it! Gettysburg revisited.... And excellent integration of historical fact with a novel which makes for a very good read for anyone interested in the Civil War and the personalities that fought it. Special attention is given to the top members of the Confederate and Union armies command structure as well as the enlisted men and their reasons for fighting this war which remain topics of debate even now. The book centers on the battle of Gettysburg which I have visited several times in Pennsylvania and the author brings to life that battle in no other way by any other author and in an authentic way which will capture the imagination of any Civil War buff. Excellent Historical Novel Having just returned from Gettysburg, I decided this would be a good time to read this too long postponed historical novel. Rather than tell a traditional &quot;narrative&quot; of battle, Killer Angels looks at events through the wholly subjective (and incredibly blind) eyes of five participants (contrary to another reviewer, Grant was not involved, and plays no part in this novel).Despite the extreme limitations of knowledge of each of the characters--which characterizes even current military battles, despite increased technology, the reader gets a very good sense of the over all ebb and flow of what happened, why generals made the decisions they did, and how much of war depnds on luck and the unanticipated consequences of decisions made for entirely different reasons.The prime example, which forms the ceterpiece of the book, is Chamberlain's defense of the Union flank at Little Round Top. Having the vastly superior position, but the uneviable job of being the far right of the Union lines, Chambelin finds his troops at dusk without enough bullets to fight off another Confederate charge. Nonetheless, he has orders not to retreat, no mattter what, because if he does, then the Confederates will be able to gain the high gtround from the rear, and the Union position will become untenable.When the Confederates charge, out of complete desperation, Chamberlain orders a bayonette charge. This appears completely suicidal (and Chamberlain probably thought that he was ordering his troops to certain death). Bayonettes in the face of bullets do not have a good track record. However, when the Confederate troops saw the charging Union soldiers, they panicked and retreated. Thus the day was saved, the battle won, and many would say, the course fo the war changed forever. Yet, the decision was made not out of bravery of tactics, but out of desperation.As good as the battle descriptions are, even more powerful are the scenes in which generals on both sides wrestle with the fact that they are issuing orders which will result in thousands of men killing thousands of their fellow citizens, and in many cases, the generals facing each other were good friends before the war. Shaara's strength is making this impossible tragedy make sense, from both sides.Shaara closes his book with a quote from Winston Churchill about how the Civil War was the bloodiest, yet least preventible wars in history. Once the tragic commitment to slavery had been made, Civil War was sure to follow. The result was a massive purging of the great American dilemna through the blood of brothers. &quot;Where were the angels?&quot;, is a question every reader should ask. When brother kills brother, which side are the angels on? The minds of men justifying sending thousands of men to their deaths. Only when the father/motherland loses it's sanctity will the horror of war end. ANGELS?? While in college, I took a synthesis course on the human response to war. Most of the books we read were World War II and Vietnam. How on Earth this book wasn't included, I have no idea?Sometimes this country takes for granted the Civil War. This book puts everything in perspective. Brother on brother. Generals fighting against their friends. It's the most important war in this country's history and maybe even the world's in the last 1,000 yaers.Read this account about the Battle of Gettysburg to find out why. An engrossing novel This is one of the best books I've ever read. It gives an interesting and personal view into the worst war in american history. I found myself understanding and admiring the men in blue and gray. Thought-provoking and mind numbing, whether a civil war buff or just mildly curious, it is both entertaining and educational. A must read. a different look listened to the book on CD after watching the movie \"Gettysburg\" and visiting the battlefield. The whole package was a great experience. Listening to the CD really provided the detail. A+ Great read/listen One of the most brilliant, moving, extraordinary, and beautiful novels I have ever read, The Killer Angels details the events of the Battle of Gettysburg from the perspective of the men who fought it. Union soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is a professor turned soldier that will make a brilliant tactical move out of desperation, a move that not only will win the battle but perhaps the war. Chamberlain is fighting the war to destroy the aristocratic South that has no business owning slaves in the democratic United States, but is also fighting to understand his feeling toward the black man and his role as a soldier. On the Confederate side, James Longstreet is fighting a war he doesn't believe in, knows he cannot win, against his own men and own army, using tactics that he knows will result in massacre and failure. And he can't even quit. Longstreet's ideas are decades ahead of his time and are considered cowardly in this age of Romantic chivalry and honor. This is the story of two armies clashing in an epic battle. One a homogeneous army of white, protestant men fighting for disunion, for their \"rights\", homes, and honor. They fight with morale under a leader they adore. The other, an army deeply varied in customs, religion, language, and color, fighting for the union of the country under the ideal that all men are created equal. This powerful, fascinating and very readable novel brings to life and understanding this momentous, chaotic, complex period of history, brings to life the men who fought this war, brings to life what went through their tortured souls and minds with staggering brilliance. An amazing novel. Grade: A+ not only one of the greatest Civil War novels I've ever read, but one of the greatest novels I've ever read. The first two-thirds of the book were somewhat of a chore to get through - my initial reaction (to a marketing blurb) was: no way this is better than Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage! Why? Well, Shaara spends the first two days shifting troops around, having protagonists yakking about pretty mundane things, doing pretty everyday things like drinking coffee... there were too many characters (various generals, colonels, officers of both sides) without sufficient depth or emotional connection to each. The prose was also not outstanding.However, once we got to the battle on the third day, it's as if we have a different book. The prose suddenly shone with the poignancy, the cannon sounds, the emotions, the confusion, the pathos of the battlefield. Chapter after chapter, Shaara's pen delivers the most engaging battle scene - not just the mechanics of it, but the emotional and psychological aspect of it - I've read... we connect with Longstreet, Chamberlain, Lee (though like Longstreet, it's hard to forgive him too)... and yes, I now concede defeat to the marketing blurb - Killer Angels is in the end (literally), better than Red Badge of Courage.On that basis (can't comment, don't know enough about, civil war history), it's a five-star. But be ready for a slow trek through the first two days as Shaara sets the stage for the finest battlefield climax yet. Shaara shines in the end I was assigned this book for summer reading for my english class. I saw it was about the civil war and I put it off because I figured I'd have to drag myself through the book. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't put this book down and finished it in 3 days. The success is due to Shaara's excellent skill. He takes the unique approach of telling the story from the view points of me on both sides. This could have been horribly executed if he wrote in a way to vilify one side or another, to make the reader root for the naturally &quot;good&quot;. Shaara goes the authentic route (and does it quite well) by making all of the men real and is able to bring out the personalities in just the writing styles.GREAT BOOK! Surprised! I was so impressed with Shaara's classic work that it spurred me to write my own novel about the Civil War. While some of the action was a bit overly condensed, which gave me an opening to write more about Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the writing is amazing. The Killer Angels is an excellent starting point for anyone studying the Civil War. Excellent Read I think Robert E Lee was indeed one of the wars greatest generals, but this book shows how age and health can case even the best to deteriorate to near incompetance. Longstreet of course is a rock as always. Great insites from the both prospectives. have listened to tape version,this one is much better throughly enjoyed this one. Have listened several times, ver well done. best recording What a fantastic book. I've always wanted to meet Robert E. Lee, and now I feel I have. Not only did I get a chance to meet the general, I got to meet a whole host of his contemporaries. While Mr. Shaara could not actually read the minds of these long gone figures, he did base his interpretation of their thoughts on surviving correspondence. Nevertheless, it was a masterful stroke to make these characters as fully human as this work does with the limited clues available in their letters and journals.If you have any interest in vicariously taking part in one of this nations most influential historical events, I strongly recommend letting Mr. Shaara be your guide. History brought to life i didn't know much about Gettysburg except there was an important battle there and President Lincoln made his famous short speech there. But this book gave me a better understanding of what went on. We were visiting there and toured the fields, so it gave me a much better understanding, rather than just looking at monuments. After going up to Little Round Top, then reading how the union soldiers were dug in there and how the rebs were just mowed down as they came up that mountain, I could visualize the battle. The whole thing makes me think how sad and useless is war. So many young American men and boys killed. Good understanding of the Battle of Gettysburg Michael Shaara has captured the very essense of the most important three days in American history. From the first word until the last, the reader is gripped by the drama and humanity of the battle of Gettysburg.Historically accurate, painstakingly researched, and flawlessly executed, The Killer Angels puts you on the battlefield and leaves you breathless.This book is a must reading for anyone who truly cares about American history. Unsurpassed brilliance - best Civil War book ever written ! I was always interested in Americas' Civil War and had read some excellent books on the subject such as \"A Brotherhood of Valor\", \"Through Blood and Fire at Gettysburg\", \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" but \"The Killer Angels\" is a very special one.Late Michael Shaara has performed an excellent research on private papers of this battle protagonist. Based on this material he produce a griping story, presenting the men that march to the tragic encounter, with their ideals, memories, sorrows, doubts & hopes.He follows Generals Lee and Longstreet, Colonel Chamberlain amongst others, penetrating their most intimate thoughts in a way the reader can't avoid wondering how this is possible.Mr. Shaara does not pick sides, he presents the reader with the confronting \"Cause\", which every man into the field believes to be just, and for which is willing to shed his blood. The valor and self sacrifice these men deploy, is reflected in each page of this incredible good book.Enough maps are shown enabling the reader to follow the displacement of the armies in the field.For the readers interested in this matter, Michael's son, Jeff, has written \"Gods & Generals\" and \"The Last Full Measure\" telling the events preceding and following this crucial struggle.A great stuff to be read by history buffs or casual readers. Enjoy!!!.Reviewed by Max Yofre. Pivotal Three Days. This book was one of the most incredible pieces of literature I have ever read. I have visited the battlefield at Gettysburg several times as a child but never really contemplated what occured there, but after reading this book I shall visit again with awe and reverence. This books moves to tears, stirs the heart and the soul, and finally, lifts one to a greater understanding of men in battle. The writing of the battles of Little Round Top and the description of Pickett's charge actually left me breathless and time seemed to stop as I read these passages. Well, anyway, this was one heck of a read. A truly amazing work. Recommended for anyone with an interest in the Civil War (obviously) but also for anyone with a desire to know the human spirit. Moments of glory...triumph...sadness...what a novel. If you have recently read &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; because its been a popular pick by the book clubs or in anticipation of the upcoming movie release, you will likely hear about &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. I had heard from a number of people that Cold Mountain was the best book of the Civil War genre since Killer Angels and one of the reviews in the book jacket for Cold Mountain comments similarly. I'm not a Civil War fan or a history buff and yet I was very much moved by what I read. If you don't like history or the Civil War as a subject, do not let it put you off from reading this book. Shaara brings the story to life so well and with such facility that you become engrossed in the novel. He almost supercedes the subject itself. Its a shame he hasn't written more 'historical novels'. His ability to put you into the perspective and the minds of the Generals and Officers involved in the conflict is second to none. Sir Walter Scott was the originator of the historical novel genre, but I haven't read anyone as good as Shaara. I can understand now why it won a Pulitzer and I would certainly expect that 100 or 200 years from people will view Shaara's work with the same reverence they view the classic novels now. Every once in a while you read a book that simply moves you as a person, that changes your perspective and your understanding of the world around you. This is one of those books. One of the Best Books I've Ever Read I enjoy history novels as they provide lessons from the past to navigate the shoals of the present. They do so in an entertaining way. Known and unknown, two sides of the same coin, the currency of war, could benefit from history when making `either-or' decisions. Without it, beyond a coin flip, unknown has the upper hand in shaping not only the strategy but he outcome of at least the battle and on occasion the war, including why you fought it. In this review I conclude with lessons learned than may be applied to decisions you make in November 2012.In our American Civil War, the troops from both sides were converging on Gettysburg, neither side knowing exactly who or how many as late as the day before the first day of the battle. Then there was the dynamic of what to believe from your Scouts. Lee suffered from this in two ways. He didn't trust his spies, and he trusted General Stuart of the Confederate Calvary was out doing anything but following orders. Buford's Calvary was, based on limited intelligence and counting on battle instinct, already digging in on Cemetery Hill and Lee discounted that information as being a Militia of townspeople. This author portrays the first shot early morning of Gettysburg came from a picket line soldier from Buford's Calvary acting on Buford's orders into the advancing Rebel Army.The first day...Buford's stand held the Rebels at bay long enough for Union reinforcement to arrive and hold the high ground While Buford's acts were courageous and strategic, two dynamics made the difference. First General Lee, not having accurate intelligence as to who was on Cemetery Hill, gave orders to proceed with caution. The orders were due to the unknown that should have been known had his Cavalry General Stuart followed orders and already been to Gettysburg. This combined with General Ewell freezing `like a pond in the dark\" gave the Confederates the town of Gettysburg, but left the advantageous high ground to the Union Army. It was an inverse predicament to Fredericksburg, where the Confederate Army held the high ground and prevailed. Like Fredericksburg, there was too much momentum to reverse the pending conflict. The unknown set the stage for unmerciful carnage.Lee's second day strategy dealt with some known and unknowns. He knew the first day's victory was due to numeric superiority against a Union Army that was just beginning to form, unbeknownst to him. He gave instruction to his Generals to proceed to Gettysburg with caution. Not having surveyed the town with that order he was not aware of the importance of achieving high ground immediately south of the town. Arriving in Gettysburg during the first day's battle he gave orders to General Ewell to take Cemetery Hill, the first hill. Ewell froze; they had the advantage in terms of battle momentum but did not take Cemetery Hill.This allowed Union forces to dig, and bought time to replenish and reinforce in mass. Had General Stuart's Calvary been available Lee would have had advance lay of the land and knowledge of Union troop strength. Instead of an order to preceed with caution, Lee would likely have stated Cemetery Hill and all high ground as an objective. Failures of Stuart and Ewell left the Rebels with a captured town and the Union digging in on high ground.Lee's second day strategic orders were an `en echelon' assault. Longstreet's orders were to sweep right and attack Cemetery Hill by surprise. In the middle of his march he realized he needed a different route than planned. This took extra time. When they were finally in position his army was tired from the march before and General Hoods regiment was facing a charge up a hill where the hill alone wad insurmountable. Both Hood and Longstreet knew at this time. Had Lee held better intelligence in the morning, an attack from the rear would have been included in the morning orders. Missing was intelligence that would have come from Stuart. What was missing was Stuart that would have carried out Lee's orders.The folly of day one battle was a clear display of undisciplined orders leading to lack of intelligence. Lomgstreet knew Lee's strategy was flawed. He had the intelligence of a spy that Lee gave half hearted attention to. With General Stuart gallivanting his cavalry across Pennsylvania, not in accord with Lee's orders, he gave Longstreet orders to attack straight up Cemetery Ridge. But Longstreet insisted on following Lee's morning orders. On day one the battlefield intelligence was much better in the afternoon than the morning, but the orders of the morning prevailed. Communications in that era did not allow for change in strategy. Strict army discipline let orders get in the way.The high ground, creative initiative, and shear instinctive courage gave Colonel Chamberlain's Maine regiment gave the Union army a strategic battle second day victory that forced an even more difficult battle plan for Lee on the third and final day of the battle of Gettysburg. In the days leading up to Chamberlain's march to Gettysburg he was ordered to discipline Union deserters from his home state of Maine. He could not find it within him to shoot them so he gave them a speech to convince them to join his regiment. The result was an additional 200 men that would prove essential in defending the Rebel charge up Cemetery Ridge on day one.The Rebels charged up the hill with what seemed to Chamberlain's regiment and infinite supply of men. They came in waves and drained the Union army of their ammunition. In preparation of the Rebel last charge of that day, Chamberlain ordered bayonets to the rifles and a counter charge down the hill at the Rebels. It was that act of courage, akin to the Charge of the Light Brigade, observed by the Rebels that sent them back down the hill never to return. Had the Rebels knew Chamberlain's troops were out of ammunition, they may had reacted differently. That Rebel charge not only cost Longstreet half of his men, he did not achieve the high ground advantage that forced an even more desperate battle strategy on Lee for the third and final day of the Battle of Gettysburg.Had Stuart and his cavalry been in Gettysburg for that second day, a flanking attack from the rear would have doomed Chamberlain long before his famous bayonet charge. Since Longstreet's charge was at the end of the Union defense, a quick victory on that portion of the whole battle field would have allowed the Confederate Army to storm right through the Union Army from the rear. Without this key advantage, the `what if' drama unfolded with the Union army digging in on both flanks forcing Lee to order on day three an attack right up the middle of the Union Army.Longstreet had grave regret for the events ordered for day and the predictable results. This gave him reason for extreme contempt for Stuart and a high degree of disdain towards General Lee. Lee had, to a fault recognized by Lee himself, a fatherly approach towards his Generals which allowed for critical failures at Gettysburg. General Ewell's failure to take Cemetery Hill when he had clear opportunity in conjunction with Stuarts failure to show up until the evening of the second day cost the Confederate Army half its troops. Together these were major contributors to the losses on day two and the eventual loss of the Battle of Gettysburg. Lee recognizing there was no one to back fill those senior ranks of General Officer was forgiving and consoling. Longstreet stressed and strained as he was the one officer with the vision to see Lee's failure. He cried visibly at the beginning of day three, sucked it up and gave the general orders for the slaughter that he knew was ensuing.If you want to look at character building and my connection to lessons learned please key word cigarroomofbooks The Unknown will get you NO!! It defined the beggining of a tottaly new era! My discovery of this piece of american history, started with my interest for films about battles, go figure, from films about II World War to films about Vietnam, so naturaly the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; caught my attention. After seeing it everything changed, and my search for more material started, until i discovered that it had been based on a book by a fellow named Michael Shaara. To my suprise discovered one of the best books i have ever read (and i have read plenty). Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, A.P. Hill, Stuart, Hancock, Armistead, Buford, among others, where brought to live before me eyes, not by the pictures of the movie, but more profoundly by the words of the author. This book taught me much about the spirit that bindes the american people, and that turned that nation into the &quot;leader&quot; of our world society. This book contains the most vivid combat descriptions, superb characterizations, fully capturing the divided lives, the heroism and the madness of this fratricidal war. NOW, STOP READING THIS AND GO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN A WONDERFULL, HISTORICAL &quot;TALE&quot; OF MEN AND THEIR BELIEVES. Was it just one more battle in the history of the world?? This novel gives you glimpses into the minds of some of the key figures in the battle of Gettysburg. It follows the chronology of the battle, day by day. Chapters are named for the characters - Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Buford, and others - and events are told from their perspectives. These are all real people who played important roles in the battle. The reader sees glimpses of the action, but not the grand scale. The maps are very helpful in seeing how the armies engaged. The author's matter-of-fact style agrees well with the topic. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads the history of the battle of Gettysburg and aches to know more. the face of history I've never considered myself a fan of historical fiction, but this is one of the best novels I've ever read. Epic in power and scope of the recreation of the leaders on both sides of the battle marking the end of the U.S's childhood as a nation, this novel is riveting and deeply moving. It does not glorify war, but marks it as something terrible we do.It does emphasize the fallacy that in light of the fluidity of technological development military strategists ever could plan for success. In a particular section, one of the leaders marvels that Jackson--yes, Stonewall Jackson, long dead before the battle of Gettysburg--could have ordered thousands of pikes to be used against musket and cannon.I don't know how accurate, it is, either, of course. It portrays Lee as an inspirational boob inspiring all who saw him while critically ignoring Longstreet's far more insightful view of tactical advantage at a terrible cost. In retrospect, of course, we know that we wouldn't have the nation we have if Lee hadn't.Still, this is a powerful work, perhaps made more powerful by our knowledge of all the bloody conflicts still to come and all the birth pangs the U.S. to this day endures. But it's a great work, a tremendous achievement, and I appreciate that it was written. Simply stunning recreation of the battle that formed our nation If you want a good picture about what it was like to defend Little Round Top, charge across a field during Pickett's Charge, or make critical decisions concerning the outcome of mens lives and the battle; READ THIS BOOK. It neither glorifies nor denounces war but focuses on the emotions and convictions of the men that fought the Battle of Gettysburg. History at it's best I could not put this book down. It tells the story of Gettysburg as well as any nonfiction book, but also delves into the human element of war and battle. The book tells the story of the battle primarily through the words and thoughts of COL Joshua Chamberlain, General Longstreet, and General Lee. If you are looking for a Civil War History starter book, this is the one. You will be hooked. A leadership book that recounts an important history. Truly the best Civil War series that I have ever read is the one by the Shaaras. These guys did an awsome job. These books are well-written and well-reaserched. I have never read a more heart-felt novel about this war. The Killer Angels brings you up close and personal with these heroes. It is written in such a way that you can laugh with them, cry with them and feel the fire of the war. I am an aspiring author myself so I can recognise hard work when I see it. I have never met a Civil War fan that didn't like these books. I would recomend this book to teachers. I believe that this is a story that needs to be told. It is very good for Americans to hear what these people sacrificed for us. Michael gave us a great gift. Brilliant! Although a Civil War buff since junior high school, I did not discover this marvel until attending the U.S. Army Command &amp; General Staff College, where it was required reading. I was not the only student who read it in one sitting. It also caused some of the most lively discussions, debates, and arguments our class engaged in throughout the course. The most compelling thing about the book was Mr. Sharra's ability to draw one completely into the characters' thoughts and emotions. It was also a concise and riveting look at commanders' relationships with other commanders and the soldiers they would send and/or lead into battle. If you are only interested in gory battle scenes, this book is not for you. Although the battle descriptions will make you feel as if you are a participant (one can almost feel the ground trembling under the largest artillery barrage ever conducted in North America), the real story is about the individuals. It is, easily, the best historical novel I have ever read. If it doesn't make you want to run out and become a Civil War reenactor, or at least read Jeff Shaara's prequel, then you need to borrow Commander Data's emotion chip. Now, where's that hoop skirt pattern? A heart-rending study in leadership Most times, I would much prefer to read a work of nonfiction as opposed to historical fiction. But after reading dozens of books about the Battle of Gettysburg, it was refreshing to read Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning Killer Angels. This fictional account gives us a viewpoint not to be found in nonfiction works.What makes Killer Angels different is that each chapter is written through the eyes of the various leaders from both the Union and the Confederacy including Buford, Longstreet, Lee, Chamberlain, Armistead, as well as an English observer, Fremantle. Shaara used diaries, journals, letters and memoirs to recreate not only what was happening on the battlefield, but also, what these men were thinking, seeing and feeling. It's as if you're an eyewitness to history. Killer Angels does not attempt to cover every minute of the Battle of Gettysburg. In fact, Shaara focuses on four main aspects: Buford's establishing Union lines on good ground before the battle, Longstreet's ambivalence about fighting at Gettysburg, Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine defending Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge.I found myself especially haunted by James Longstreet. Once a carefree, amiable man, he's still reeling from the recent deaths of 3 of his 4 children in one week. Robert E. Lee's number two man, he knows that a frontal attack (Pickett's charge) will be disastrous. He is tortured that Lee won't listen to his advice, and inconsolable after so many men are killed. \"Along with all the horror of loss, and the weariness, and all the sick helpless rage, there was coming now a monstrous disgust. He was through. They had all died for nothing and he sent them...The army would not recover from this day.\"I also gained an appreciation for Joshua Chamberlain. Chamberlain was not a trained soldier, but a college professor. But he was definitely a born leader. He started the Civil War as a lieutenant colonel and finished as a brigadier general. His heroics in leading his men on Little Round Top is a thing of legend, probably saved the Union and earned him a Medal of Honor.I have found that once Gettysburg has gotten under your skin, you'll never tire of reading about this important battle that changed the course of the war. For fictional accounts, Killer Angels is about as good as it gets. As good as it gets... I've always wanted to be a writer. Now I can't, because there is no way I could ever top the emotion, insight and history of Shaara's masterpiece. Even if you aren't the least bit interested in the Civil War, reading this magnificent work of art will perhaps make you realize that the Battle of Gettysburg was the penultimate moment in this country's history. It's tragic beauty. I can't imagine anyone putting this book down... Heartfelt and brutal literature A writer this good should have had a great editor who could hold his feet to the fire and show him some matters of craft that a few of the best writers of today employ. Shame, shame, shame. Could Have an Enduring Work of Art I'm not a Civil War buff, preferring my military history more current, but I read Killer Angels because so many friends recommended it. Now, I'm going to read everything Michael Shaara and his son Jeff (another historic fiction novelist) have written. The author approaches the Battle of Gettysburg from the human side. He touches on causes, but only as the soldiers would experience them. One Union soldier laments that if the South wins, he will no longer be able to visit the great fishing holes he enjoys in what would become a new and separate nation if the South wins.The youthful soldiers on both sides, the battles they endure without enough food or supplies, the repercussions of a volunteer army--boys and men volunteered alongside others from their own state--makes for greater drama than any military fiction. No one was conscripted. The fear many felt because they weren't warriors, weren't trained in battle, just common people drawn into the cause of their side. Killer Angels doesn't replace the typical historic account of Gettysburg. It enhances it by adding the human layer, likely the most important in any battle. Even 150 years ago, the military taught its grunts to fight for the guy next to them in the foxhole, not some cause their government espoused.In the end, my heart was saddened for the losers, for the death of their dreams and the loss of their innocence. I never did decide which side Shaara considered to be the Killer Angels.( Even if you know the Battle of Gettysburg, read this This book not only depics the battle of Gettysburg, but digs into the personalities of the officers on each side, their close friendships at Westpoint and theit fighting spirit on the battlefield. killer angels I didnt like the author's writing style. He could have made a brilliant adventure on every page, but gets lost in too many details rather than the overall picture of events. Still a good read, I just wasn't \"blown away\" like so many people said I would be. OK but drab The Killer Angels is one of, if not the greatest and most compassionately written war books of anybody's generation. By showing both sides of the fight without showing favorites, Shaara really does show that there are no winners in war. He gets through all the myths and goes straight to the meaning of this legendary battle. Taking place in the few days before and after the Battle of Gettysburg, Shaara depicts a feeling of camaraderie and hope in both armies. The main characters, such as Peter Longstreet, Joshua Chamberlain, and Robert Lee, are beautifully developed and readers will get up close and personal with their thoughts and feelings of what is going on during their day.The South is portrayed not as slave drivers with a thirst for power, but rather as people fighting for what they believe in. As a soldier for the Confederacy put it, the war was not about slavery. Instead it is as if the South joined a club, and as easily as they were admitted, they want out, but the North will not have that.Placed through out the book is a series of maps to better the understanding of the peril of each army's stance in the war. Greatly researched, the maps provide positions of different brigades and squadrons, their general, and an estimate, shown in size, of how many soldiers are in each group. Shaara also seperaes the book into different days, starting on day 1 and ending on day 4. The first two days are spent explaining each army's predicaments and feelings of their situations. The second two are an in-depth portrayal of the losses and emotional roller coaster war can rage on soldiers.Not being an avid Civil War enthusiast, several people recommended this book to me, and it could not have been a better suggestion. This book surpasses far and beyond what a movie could in entertainment and educational value. I found myself flipping page after page as I became engrossed in Michael Shaara's interpretation of the American Civil War in, The Killer Angels. Wow. I had never been a fan of the Civil War, and picked up Mr. Shaara's book only after it was repeatedly suggested as an excellent piece of literature. This book has completely changed my view of the Civil War and my interest in historical fiction. I couldn't put it down, and finished it in two days.The book is a fast-paced account of the 4 days of battle at Gettysburg. Mr. Shaara wrote the book based as accurately as he could from the accounts of those who were there, doing so in the first person primarily through 4 of the commanding generals. It is Mr. Shaara's understanding of Confederate General Robert E. Lee that is the most impressive, he seems to do an excellent job in letting us glimpse how this now highly revered General looked at the war. Another lead character is Union Col. Joshua Chamberlain, a fascinating introduction as Chamberlain had been a professor at Bowdoin University with no military experience. His perspective on the war is vastly different from Lee's, allowing him to function as a well-written foil to Lee's perspective as a career military man. Chamberlain's unit was key to holding the Union flank and their ultimate success in this most devastating of battles.This book was so good that I have gone on to read/listen to multiple other books on the Civil War, including all of the books by Jeff Shaara, the author's son. This however, has been the clear best of the bunch. I cannot recommend the book enough, it is absolutely riveting. The Best Civil War Book Ever We had to read this book in English class, and it is INCREDIBLY boring, and hard to even read one page.I do NOT recommend this book.Please, save yourself the time. Zero if I could Virtually every seasoned Civil War buff has already read The Killer Angels, but there is a new generation of history readers coming along that must be made aware of this brilliant and compelling work of art. Even readers not particularly interested in military history would enjoy this wonderfully written and fact-based account of the Battle of Gettysburg, a major turning point in the war between the states.Shaara's account of Joshua Chamberlain's crucial defense of Little Roundtop and his repelling bayonet charge against a veteran Rebel force that had never tasted defeat will send chills up your spine. Red-blooded Americans north and south will cheer at the bravery, while simultaneously blanching at the folly and gore of a pitched battle.Shaara brings several things to this book. Fantastic characterizations is one. By book's end you feel as if you know and understand each major character and how and why they acted as they did. Ability to write is another. His descriptions of scene, battle, time, and emotion are top notch. The story pours out like fine wine. Shaara also breaks new ground with The Killer Angels by fictionalizing a historical event. This is a technique that will be copied many times over. His thorough research is to be commended as well. Shaara is that rare mix of good writer and historian.The only question I was left with at the end was why Lee, touted as such a military genius, would proceed with the ill-advised and ultimately tragic Pickett's Charge. I found the answer in Shelby Foote's &quot;The Civil War.&quot; Lee, abandoned by Jeb Stuart's Cavalry, over-extended in enemy territory, out-numbered, under-supplied, and under the gun, returned to the one thing that had never failed him in campaign after campaign: the bold frontal attack that always seemed to rout the Yankees. It's hard to understand Lee's motivations without getting a broader sense of his prior actions. I recommend both books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author Wake Up Dead. The Best One-Battle Book Ever. I'll admit it right away, I am not a fan of history-type books. I am usually bored to death by them. However, I recently read this after an eighth-grade trip to Gettysburg on the recommendation of a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised. It reads more like a good novel than a history textbook, while at the same time being very informative as to what went on. Very well written! A surprising delight I love reading about history whether its novelized or non-fiction. But this book was very different from all the other novels I've read. Shaara tries to encompass the whole Civil War in those 3 days. Its amazing how Shaara includes not only the battle but the whole philosophy of the entire War. I think that's the part that really moved me. He seems to depict the main characters so thoroughly that the reader seems to know each one of them as real humans not just historical characters in history books. I have never read a novelize history book with so much fiction along with history. I think 'The Killer Angels' was one of the best novels I've ever read. The best fictional history I've ever read This was an incredible read. It imparts all of the tension, drama and romance needed to give an in depth view into the events surrounding and during Gettysburg. I've read it over and over, as well as Jeff Shaara's &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. Perhaps one of the best historical novels ever.",

         "I am not a big fan of anything western or cheesy romance stuff- I only had this to read one day, and I totally loved it!! Really Great I was so surprised that no one had previously reviewed this book! The story caught me from the first page, and was very hard to put back down! This book was so well written and all the characters, especially Maddie and Mr. SOB were brought to life. Humor, drama, life and death situations, this story had it all. I have to admit that I would have liked to see it end a bit differently, but for the era that the book was written in, it was appropriate! Highly Recommended!! Nice Surprise!! The Man From Stone Creek is a historical western romance set in 1903 in the Arizona Territory. The main romance is filled with suspense as the hero seeks to round up cattle rustlers and train robbers. The novel achieves an emotional depth as the heroine's romance heals a past tragedy. Linda Lael Miller's romance, however, is not just a hero-heroine romance --- it is the romance of a whole town where justice is found and the downtrodden find love.Lawman Sam O'Ballivan has come to town to replace the schoolteacher. The minute he arrives, the local schoolboy fight and the boys learn justice O'Ballivan style. The boy who teased another is himself held by his feet with his head dangling down the well. The disciplined boy's complaints to his mother brings him to the attention of postmistress Maddie Chancelor. The sparks fly. When they collide, circumstances force Maddie into the sight of the most dangerous family in town. With Sam by her side, will she conquer the past or will his secret mission place her in the thick of even more trouble?Sam may be working undercover to capture the castle rustlers and thieves terrorizing the local area, but his efforts to blend just seem to lead him into more trouble. Just as he realizes Maddie has his heart, his intended bride comes in on the stagecoach. Can it get any worse? Of course! The question is can all this danger change hearts so that romance succeeds?Linda Lael Miller's magnificent romance is more than just Sam and Maddie. The reader sees problems that plagued the American West: the terrorists of the day, sickness, brothels which were often the only way for a woman to survive, children left orphaned or in need, and those left behind in the huge expansion of the West. The author does not shrink from the unpleasant realities of the historical setting, but she creates a romance where hearts are healed. Orphans and lost souls (children, adults and animals) find goodness, and justice is served. When her characters dare to opens their hearts and expose their vulnerabilities, love is found, and the lost or neglected who surround them get found. Man from Stone Creek stirs up trouble and romances the whole town There's a new schoolmaster in Haven, Arizona, and he's making waves. While the current teacher is the bookish wimp of a man the residents of Haven expect to find doing woman's work, his replacement is something else altogether. Sam O'Ballivan may be a schoolmaster but he's not like any this town has ever seen. In fact, he's big and he's broad and he's armed and he has the women of Haven, from housewives to ladies of the evening, swooning.One woman who is immune to his sterling qualities, however, is postmistress and merchant Maddie Chancelor. Already overprotective of her younger brother, Terran, Miss Chancelor doesn't take kindly when the new schoolmaster upbraids him for a boyish but potentially harmful prank within minutes of riding into town. Maddie is determined to keep the undercover lawman at arm's length, but that proves harder and harder to do as they are repeatedly thrown together.While Sam is taking on the local children as well as working undercover to round up a local band of train robbers and rustlers, Maddie Chancelor is a complication he didn't anticipate. He may be engaged to the girl back home, but it's Maddie who fills his mind and heats his loins even as she's railing at him for his shortcomings. He can't help but be enchanted by this woman's beauty and personality even as she hides her inner tenderness under a tough exterior designed to help her provide for herself and her brother in a man's world.It doesn't take long for Sam to hone in on possible suspects for wrongdoing when he encounters the wild and wanton Donagher family. The patriarch, Mungo, is a stern and scowling man who keeps his four sons in line with fear and physical violence. Too bad he doesn't have the same effect on his hot-to-trot wife, Undine, who has developed a strong attraction to Sam.It's hard for a man to get any work done, however, when there is a constant stream of the needy dropping in on him in the schoolhouse. From little Violet Perkins who needs to be taught to bathe and could use some new clothes, to Oralee Pringle, the proprietress of the Rattlesnake Saloon and a puppy in need of a home, everyone seems to need a piece of Sam's time. Even fancy woman Bird of Paradise comes bearing food and offers of other sensual delights enough to tempt a man. Somehow though, Sam manages to stick to his business even if his mind tends to wander to more pleasurable pursuits.THE MAN FROM STONE CREEK by Linda Lael Miller is an absolutely delightful romance with plenty of action that transported me to the Old West and kept me there page after page as I got to know the endearing residents of Haven. It's a definite keeper for my bookshelf and one I'll take time to reread even when I'm tempted by the plethora of new books that constantly vie for my attention. It's one of those books that makes you wonder, long after you've read the last page, what the people you've come to know and love are doing.--- Reviewed by Amie Taylor A page-turner from start to finish I love Linda lael Miller. This is a good book and you will enjoy it. The Man From Stone Creek",

         "Very helpful, photos illustrate the step by step instructions in the text. Covers my 1982 R100rs. I would recommend this manual. great help, very clear I bought an old BMW that needed some TLC. I didn't want to take it to the mechanic for every little issue, and this book has helped me immensely. I found the diagrams helpful and the step by step instructions to be accurate. While I'm not much of a gear-head and I admit that other books may be more thorough this does everything I need and has lots of useful information. Thanks to this book, I've done some repairs that I would've thought previously were out of my ability, and I did them well. Very Handy Book This book is great, I tuned up my 79 R100RT in no time at all. Good illustrations, directions and tips.Iam very satisified. Bmw R50/5 Through R100Gs Pd: 1970-1996 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair) I find this manual just about useless. They have crammed too many models into one manual and the information is so convuluted it is almost impossible to find the information specific to your bike.I have 2 R100GS bikes and finally end up just doing the work rather than try and follow anything in this book.I will say the wiring diagram is pretty nice, but that's available for free from several sources.When I first got it I tried just to find what size the tires on my bike are and that information, along with much other useful information is not in the manual at all.I would definitely look elsewhere if you have an airhead BMW. Difficult to find what you need I needed a good book to detail the pieces of the R100GS fairing and control cluster, so I could re-assemble a bike that had been badly \"customized\" This manual had the diagrams, the pictures, and the wiring information I needed. Good history on the different BMW models in the preface as well. Great for R100GS info",

         "Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)",
         "I enjoyed this book. I am now reading the rest of the series and I have not been disappointed. You fall in love with the characters, the story and Richards drive to save the people he loves. Just awesome, a recommended read!!!! Awesome It's been a while since I've read this book, perhaps a few years back, actuually, but I do remember why I got it. Imagine this:I'm in a book store with a limited amount of money, maybe enough for two paperbacks. Wanting to get my money's worth and passed over smaller (but much better) books to try out this monster of a novel, what a great deal! I figured that even after I finish this one, Mr. Goodkind has other books in the series to keep me interested for a good long time. I soon realized that I should've listened once again to the age-old morals I've been taught as a child but never listened to.Quality, not quantity.To give the author proper due, he does describe everything in full and rich detail, painting a picture of the scene before you. Unfortunately, my praise has to stop there. Every character within the story happens to be a flat, one-dimensional stereotypical person, with changes in personality that doesn't make any type of sense. As another reviewer mentioned, a lot of focus was placed on 'friends' and what they do for each other. Oh oh, I'm getting queasy just remembering this. It was very painful to read, but I spent money on it so I will damn well read the whole thing even if it made me physically ill. The only thing that made it tolerable and maybe even a bit more enjoyable was imagining the whole book as an anime (and I do love anime :) ).. then all the melodrama and posturing made more sense, not to mention all the kinky S&amp;M + over the top torture. The only redeeming thing about this novel is that it is a fairly enclosed book (ie. doesn't end with a cliffhanger) so I wouldn't be forced to read another just to finish the 'story'.I did finish the book, however, and it is now with a friend somewhere on the other side of the continent with the hope that she reads a bit of it and tell me if it is really that bad or that I am just nuts. I think it is rightfully still gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. Masochism, anime, and a major migraine. I loved this book! The action and story line was non-stop...It was hard to ever put the book down. No non-essential details or rambling story lines it was all stuff i wanted to know. Enjoy! I only hope the other 10 in the series are the same. Best book I've read in a while... This book started slow and I almost didn't finish it. Don't make this mistake. It picks up in the middle and then it never slows down. It is a very good read.In Wizard's First Rule, we are introduce to Richard, a ranger. His father was recently murdered, and it was gruesome. While off the in the forest, he encounters a beautiful women fleeing for her life. Is there a connection?From these earlier scenes, we encounter Wizards, Witches, Friendly Spirits and Deadly Ghosts. There are also talking dragons and flying, fierce winged warrior beasts.The whole world may be destroyed, if Richard makes the wrong choice. The writer has a good sense of style, and good sense of humor, and an interesting sense of morality. At one point a Wizard says that he did the worst thing possible, he let the people suffer from the consequences of their actions. Of all this is an excellent book and I think most fantasy lovers will enjoy it. A good start in a great series. Excellent Book. I read a lot of highly technical material for work so I admit I don't read as much for pleasure as many others. I prefer fantasy/sci-fi; Tolkien and Frank Herbert are obvious choices as favorites for deeper reading, and I admit I'm partial to McCaffrey's Pern books and Ray Feist when I want something light. Feist is the kind of writer who makes me think writing a fantasy novel would be fun and easy; just write up an old D&D; campaign! (I realize it's not actually that simple and I certainly don't have time to pursue it myself, but that's how Feist makes me feel when I read him.)I wanted something vaguely along those lines. I had heard of Goodkind and picked up _Phantom_ at Target right before heading off, not realizing it's the 11th book in the series. When I realized the series was called the \"Sword of Truth\" series, an alarm went off in my head (I need to learn to listen to those). But I found a bookstore on the trip and bought the first book, _Wizards First Rule_.Ugh. I found this to be hopelessly hackneyed and depressingly derivative. (Warning: I haven't even read Jordan's WoT series and I *still* thought this was derivative.) I think \"leave no cliche unturned\" must have been Goodkind's motto when writing this. Other 1-star reviews here are spot-on with this; this novel is almost a parody of the fantasy/sci-fi genre. (Actually, it probably would have been better as a parody.)I almost gave up on it numerous time but I hung in there to find out what a Confessor was and I really hope that was Goodkind's idea, because it was the only standout concept in the entire book. At that point the book was more than half over and I plowed on figuring I got that far, might as well finish.The major \"departure\" from the cliche-fest is Goodkind's agenda of inserting political philosophy. I found this almost comically ham-handed. You see, the bad guys are Commies! Yep, complete with the \"People's Palace.\" I actually laughed out loud at the \"trial\" of the farmer by the evil queen (whose name I forget; surprisingly, it isn't \"Queen Mao\"). Message to all you fantasy fans who think this is deep and philosophical because he included this: no, it really isn't. Not a single idea expressed is novel and his descriptions of the positions are simplistic caricatures.And the 100-page excursion into S&M; was simply juvenile and served almost exactly no purpose. I'm sure I would have loved it when I was 13; I thought McCaffrey's _Dragonflight_ was pretty racy back then.And I fail to see what's so compelling about the characters that all these five-star reviews get on about. What's interesting about Richard? He's freaking superman: big, strong, slightly clueless (except when it's REALLY important to get out of some contrived jam), but flawless woodsman, horse rider, archer, swordsman, wannabe wizard, etc. Yawn. I was shocked that he didn't turn water into wine at some point in the book. While some of the other characters were indeed better, the problem is that the worst character happened to be the main protagonist and most of the pages were devoted to him.One of the finer moments which almost caused me to put the book down was the name of the villain: Darken. Seriously, Darken. You know, as in \"dark.\" Remember, kids, black = evil! I was similarly shocked when Goodkind didn't have him wear a black cowboy hat. I know, that's a really stupid surface feature and doesn't get to the heart of whether the writing or the story or the characters are good. But look at it this way: if the easy stuff is that blunt, how well do you think he did with the important stuff?And for the love of all that is holy, who was Goodkind's editor? 800 pages? For this? I want that editor's job. \"Sure, Terry, just leave it all in there... yeah, I gotta run, I have an afternoon tee time...\" How about EDITING?Now, to be honest, I didn't hate every minute of it. Honestly, when I finished this book and thought about how I felt about it, I was thinking 1.5 stars. Seeing that the average is four, though, I had to give it one rather than two to drop the average. There is NO WAY this is a four-star book. None. I can see how maybe someone with somewhat different tastes could give it a three, but four seems like a serious reach and five is IMPOSSIBLE. _Dune_ is a five-star book. _Lord of the Rings_ are five-star books. I'm very, very afraid to see that some people think this belongs in the same category. Very afraid indeed. PLEASE don't be suckered in by the 4-star average! Anxious to see of Book #2 is as good as the first one. Hoping this series does not evolve into a soap opera. Almost as riveting as Terry Brooks. Terry Goodkind is simply awe-inspiring. His prose is the best I've encountered in a long while. This is a must read! Thank you Mr. Goodkind! This book was a bit too much of the typical fantasy novel with the all powerful bad guy and the band of merry men who have to find a way to stop him. Despite it's 800 or so pages, I finished it very quickly, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was so simple that I didn't have to think about what I was reading. That isn't too say it didn't have any redeeming qualities. It was entertaining enough for me to want to finish it, but was definately along the lines of easy summer reading. Okay I am not usually read fantasy books. But somehow I picked up this one. The first chapter was difficult going but after that I was enthralled in the world that Goodkind created. The wizards, the confessors, the sword of truth...I read the whole book in one night. Though the major theme, good vs. evil, is not original or complex, it is the characters and the magnificent creatures and settings that makes this book so spellbinding. A Fantastic Fantasy This was recommended by many family members, and when I finally read it, it was entertaining and enjoyable! Great fantasy. Great book. Maybe I've been forever spoiled by Tolkien. Maybe I'm setting the bar too high because I expect my heroes to be heroic in the old sense of the word (like the heroes of Icelanding and northern mythology that he drew from) and my characters, especially the dragons, to possess certain characteristics that don't make them seem like people from the 1990's. Maybe I expect a world rich in magic and culture and worth saving, and maybe I like villains who I can feel are evil without their having to torture children or ravish women in explicit detail. It's possible, I suppose, that these and other factors make it impossible for me to really enjoy a fantasy novel like this one.This book is not without its merits. Some of the minor characters are very interesting, and there are times when the narrative is gripping. But overall this novel fell very short for me for a number of reasons. The main characters are at times very interesting, at times dull and boring. The hero, Richard, is a fairly flat character, always doing the right thing and unfailing in his devotion to the woman he loves. At times he is brilliant and insightful-at times he lets the most obvious detail rush past him without even considering it. Much of the trouble he gets in comes from completely missing something obvious, most of the trouble he gets himself out of comes from an astute observation that puts him in possession of some knowledge you'd swear he couldn't have gotten on his own.Kahlan, the heroine, could be a great character if it weren't for her girl next door qualities that make it difficult to really believe in her. Most of the other main characters share some of these qualities-you want to like them, but you just can't quite bring yourself to do it. For the most part the dialog is corny and the plot glaringly predictable. The author's attempts at plot twists usually stem out of \"this is impossible-there's no way it can be done\" followed by a character finding a way it can, in fact, be done.So why give it a decent rating? Quite simply put I don't feel that the time I took to read the book was wasted. The book is an entertaining read, and some of the adventures our heroes find themselves in are done well. I did find myself reading large parts of the book at a time-something I don't do when I'm struggling to finish a book. Still, there just isn't enough here to call it good fantasy. The constant hopeless situations the characters find themselves in are tedious-you won't believe how many brushes with death two people can have in the course of a day or a week. Still, Goodkind does a decent job of moving the plot along (even though, as I said, it is incredibly predictable) and has a talent for detail and descriptions, especially of scenery. One redeeming quality of the book is one reason I won't be reading the rest of them-the characters, especially Kahlan, show many sides throughout the book and vary from weakness to an inner strength that ultimately rounds them out nicely. That said, having seen the full spectrum of Kahlan's character in this book makes me feel there's nothing else she can offer to the plot of the next books.In conclusion, if you're a fantasy diehard this book (and who knows, maybe the series) are worth a look. I didn't particularly enjoy the book but didn't put it down either, so I guess it was worth one read. Just one though-no finishing of the series for me. Predictable, but not a total waste of time Wow lots of bad or lackluster reviews.I picked up these books long ago because they 1) were fat, and 2) looked interesting. I love long complex stories that have time to really explore people/charactors and these books did not let me down.Maybe the way Terry teaches moral lessons through the events of his charactors as he tells this amazing story are too much for some folks.I have just reread the first 5 books in this series for the 3rd time I'm still amazed at the strong emotions he can invoke. From joy, to humor, to sadness Terry uses his story to entertain and to teach. Richard may be the main char in the book but Khalan comes in a close second. A stronger woman is hard to find and between them they present great role models for everyone.Each book reveals a new Wizards rule which is staring each of us in the face everyday if only we cared to see it. To spoil the first rule: People will believe what they want to believe. Just look around and you can see how true this is. Facts seem to have no bearing on what people believe.Enjoy the story and watch as Terry explains our real world as he entertains you. Refeshing, emotional, great book(s) I had read all of Jordan's books and liked them. I had read most of Mercades Lackay's books after picking up Winds of Fate off the shelf at random. I was so board because I could not find anything that kept me reading for more than 5 pages. Then I saw Wizard's First Rule on the shelf and decided to try it. That was close the best decision of my life. I read it in 3 days, because it was so inthralling. It has the usual fantasy ingrediants, romance, magic, different kingdoms in conflict. But it also had suprises waiting in every page. I loved it. Kahlan and Moiraine (of Jordan's Wheel of Time) have become my heroines, and I adored Rachel. Most people reveiwing Goodkind say it resembles Jordan's work. I think that Terry Goodkind has made a better first book than Jordan's Eye of the World, which I love and own. Wizard's First Rule is much more inthralling at the start and drws you in more than the Eye of the World. I, personally, love it. I rate it 6 out of 5 stars if I could. Oh, did I mention, I read it over 3 times after I finished it? Great Book Of late, I get skeptical with multiple volume sagas, but Wizard's First Rule (WFR) has a lot going for it. First of all, the characters are unpretentiously realistic. Throughout the book, despite their respective gifts, the protagonists retain their essential human traits of jealously and insecurity, refreshing counterpoints to their undoubted merits. These are no infallible superbeings, thank God. The downside to their abilities too is spelled out clearly as Terry Goodkind (TG) brings out the cost to them of exercising their powers. For that matter, the villain, wicked as he is, is not pure unalloyed evil either. Clearly, TG deals in many shades of grey, and not pure black and white. Secondly, TG has introduced some interestingly novel concepts like the magic of the Confessors, the Mord-Sith. A number of reviews have protested the graphic violence and sexual assault depicted but I must disagree. Yes, the depictions are gory and make your stomach twist, but their integrity to the story line is beyond question. It is only as you continue past the first volume that you realize how important to the saga these harsh scenes are. For all that, there are flaws aplenty. Some of TG's concepts are almost insultingly silly like classifying magic as Additive and Subtractive (I suppose he was trying to avoid the hackneyed white vs. black or good vs. evil, but this is a pathetic substitute) or short tailed gars being smart because they count their blood flies (Puhleeze!). Also the absence of a prologue is unsettling and the quality of the maps is terrible. Why do fantasy authors never realize that a reader needs maps to picture a new world? Figuring the geographic location of the characters from the maps provided is a task for the very gifted indeed. First time readers would do well to first read \"Debt of Bones\", a short story by TG, set prior to the events of WFR, (which can be found in \"Legends : Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy\" edited by Robert Silverberg) as this provides some context for the saga. All in all, a very good beginning and a must for fantasy fans. Be warned, this book is insidiously hypnotic. Once you start reading, you will find it very difficult to stop! Excellent - hard to put down. A good read with lots of action. Our hero Richard Cypher gets into one tight spot after another and amazingly escapes. Great book for both young and old. I am looking forward to next book in the series. Goodkind's Wizard's First Rule First Introduce to me by my husband. Now I can't help myself to his next book.. It is great story, which have lot of plot, medival background plus magical and fantasy in throw into the plot too. Great BOok. My First Fantasy Book.. Great Book &amp; Great Fantasy Thrilling, but could have been a lot better if ...1. Some elements would have received more thought. Take the \"boundary\" for example. As was mentioned in a review before the \"boundary\" makes little sense the way it is presented. The differences between the two worlds separated only about 20 years ago are not reasonable. The \"boundary\" should have been there for a few hundred years at least to make sense in the context of the story. Another example, the space of the world the story takes place seems to bee stupidly small. It makes you fell like you can travel from one corner of the world to the other in a matter of days.2. The \"speed\" of the story would have been more constant. What I mean is that sometimes the story \"rushes\" trough the events making your head spin around when a lot of significant things happen very fast, while others times the story just \"camps\" making you want to skip a few pages. Not a good writing technique. The same with details. Sometimes the author exposes every tiny detail as if he wants everyone to get a very detailed picture of what is happening while other times he reveals very few details leting the reader's imagination to complete the picture. Decide! it should be either the first or the second approach.3. The story takes places in an fantasy world inspired mostly from medieval Europe (like most fantasy novels). However (some of )the characters way of thinking (psychology?) seams to belong in our modern western culture. Emphases of modern (politically correct)themes like pedophilia, rape or equality between sexes are unnatural to the story \"medieval\" atmosphere as are some of the characters dilemmas.4. Last, as in too many fantasy stories the characters (both good and bad) are sometimes ludicrously overconfident. Their success is based too much on good luck. I think it wouldn't hurt to make them more realistic. Thrilling, but could have been a lot better if ... This book was a true masterpeice, Richard Cypher comes from a land of no magic and is thrust into a ferocious battle with an unimaginable evil: Darken Rahl. The only weapon he has is the magical Sword Of Truth that his wizard friend gives to him. His companions are Zedd and the Mother Confesser: Kahlan Amnell. Richard follows Kahlan blindly into the midlands to fight Darken Rahl. This book was excellent and anybody who critizes it is out of their mind. By pure chance i got this book of the shelf of a librarby in a pick-and-choose mood. EXCELLENT, ENGAGING Oh dear. Having just finished the Robyn Hobb Liveship seeries I looked for another series to start reading. This time I wanted to go with something that was largely published so I didn't have to wait between installments. Now I won't have to. This book and the second in the series were complete shockers.Save your money.Rob Boring, trite, repetitive, simplistic Now, this review is coming from a self-proclaimed fantasy snob. I don't read fantasy-- except for Tolkien... but for some reason I decided to start this series.Imagine my surprise when I really enjoyed the book. It has fast-paced action, characters that I liked and hated, and by the end, I'll admit, I had a itsy-bitsy crush on Richard.I didn't notice any major issues with the story line or language... there were a few editing issues that I caught, but despite the elements that are undoubtedly similar to Star Wars and LOTR... it was still an interesting, well-written easy to read and enjoy thrill ride.It is very adult in places, so I don't recommend this to children, not even young teenagers.All in all, good read! Good Book! I didn't expect to like this book. My husband got me to read it, and I'm glad he did. It is inventive, lushly descriptive, and the characters are wonderful. It's a beautiful novel. It has incredible intracicies. The story twists and turns. Goodkind is a master of description, drawing the reader into this fantastic world. When you learn what the Wizard's First Rule is, you'll be surprised. In many ways, it's a story of romance and Goodkind's interesting, individualistic philosophy of the world. It's truly a great story, one of the best I've ever read. Just a plain wonderful story! The joy of this book is in that the concepts put forth by the author are simple, direct, and therefore all the more powerful for it. The best ideas are those that are clean and easy to understand, and Wizard's First Rule manages to incorporate several of these philosophies into a story that is not only entertaining, but involves characters whose motivations, while not high-minded or full of \"deep\" meaning, are -real-. An easy response I love this book! I could not put it down. The characters are awesome, Zed is my favorite. Everybody that has borrowed it from me are hooked on the series now. My favorite book This book is a great read and very original material. I love the creative different classes of characters. There is great drama between the characters and a very good story line. I highly recommend for anyone that loves fantasy. Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1) My step-dad, Ashley, told me to read this book. Even though he only read half, I trust his judgment. I mean, he got me into Dragonlance! I doubted a little when I read reviews of this book, saying it was \"bland and conventional\", had \"bad dialog and prose\" and is \"overwritten, hackneyed and lengthy.\" My guess is that these reviewers didnt actually finnish the book. Yes, there were very obvious and over used fantasy cliches, like the innocent farm boy-turns hero, old mentor for life is actually very powerful wizard, and maiden saved in first chapter is love intrest through the whole story. But Terry Goodkind is able to take this basic stuff and turn it into something wonderful. AND, for those who call it unoriginal, I'd like to point out that there was not one elf or dwarf. Plus, theres an evil villian you just love to loath, and the Mord-Sith completly took me off guard. Also, the main charector's name: Richard. So simple, so common, so easy to pronounce. I think it adds to the rawness of the story. This book is wonderfuly detailed, and the shocker at the end is so painfuly obvious that it makes you deliciously surprised, flabergasted, and left wanting for more. Personaly, I found the \"love conflict\" resolved to quickly, and it was a bit cheesy. And at times, I thought I could have written the dialouge better. BUT, the book was amazing. For a first book, Goodkind definetly outdid himself. Did they bother to finnish it? I just finished &quot;Wizards First Rule&quot; (Okay I thought the way Goodkind worked the title into the story was nicely done) and for the most part I was rather disappointed by the book. While I found the book to move along quickly, I also found it to be very predictable. I found the way Goodkind repeatedly had his characters ignore ALL the clues and just happily muck things up (but always recover effortlessly) rather insulting. I will not compare this book to any other, I believe that to be unfair to the ART in a book. I will say that, with the exception of the torture pages, this would have made a wonderful read for older children and young adults.In summary: This book, because of the torture and sado-erotic portion is not recommended for young readers. Further, because of the simple plot twists and writing style, this book may be too juvenile for many adult readers. However, if you simply must have something to read for that flight from NY to LA (why I grabbed it) or just want to be entertained without needing to think too much this is not a bad book. Easy read but too predictable I totally enjoyed the book. A very good read with a love story as an added sub story. If you enjoyed the Inheritance series then you will enjoy this one. Excelent just plain good I read this once before, 7 or 8 years ago. But after reading Goodkind's newest, The Legend of Magna Searus, I knew I needed/wanted to read it again. This book was even better, now that some things had been explained. I highly recommend both books! Even better the second time This is a dark and graphic book. And I don't mean just in a blood and guts way but in a really evil, sick way. Horrendous evils are described. What are some of the worst things you can imagine happening to someone (even a child)? It's in there. The author has an extremely sick imagination. I was really disturbed by this book. A friend of mine recommended it to me and knowing her, I'm shocked that SHE likes it. I love fantasy and this is like no fantasy I've ever read. There are some moving/touching moments in the book, but it's not worth all the horror. But, if you're into 'horror fantasy' then you might like it.The writing is not that great. The adult characters often make elementary grammar mistakes which make them sound like 3 year olds. And they repeat their gestures a lot, such as 'small smiles', 'quiet smiles,' holding each other's chins, looking at each other from 'under their eyebrows' etc. But despite the writing fallacies (it's his first novel after all), I would have enjoyed the story if it were not for all the unnecessary disturbing descriptions.Unless you enjoy reading about dark and terrible acts of cruelty and disgusting things being done to people, avoid this book. Wow is this gory. It is REALLY gory. Did I mention it was gory? Wonderful story. You will fall in love with the characters. Good service too. Wizard's First Rule This book is one of my favourites, firstly it does not do the whole \"lets copy tolkien and capitalise on it\" and is quite original in its world making. As far as i can remember there are no orcs or elves in this book which already is a bonus to being original in creature creation. A very original story that grips you and leaves you breathless for more (refer to the mord-sith ordeal). Terry has a nice fluid style of writing and thats important as it makes the story feel smoother and it flows easier. Great non-cliche Standard fantasy plot: good vs. evil, world hangs in balance, unlikely hero. The badness starts with Richard, the protagonist. \"A rare person,\" other characters annoyingly remind us. What they mean is that he unwaveringly does the right thing. A fine trait in a human. A bad trait in a character. It makes him seem flat. It also devalues his struggles, because the only thing that can save such a stubborn protagonist from such a dangerous world is screwball world logic. At the same time, Goodkind strives for horrific villains and situations, but combined with the shallow characters and cartoonish twists, it just feels distasteful and off, like the Muppets doing a torture documentary.Even when it's not grim, the story's pretty cheesy. For example, what does god-of-evil antagonist Darken Rahl do when he captures Richard? He leaves Richard with a leather-clad dominatrix who tortures him by biting his lower lip and zapping him with a magical riding crop. Um... with enemies like these, couldn't all of us be unwavering? I've squandered many paychecks on the very same treatment, but supposedly it's a fate worse than death. Granted, the scene gave me a week's worth of masturbation fodder, but couldn't Goodkind give his reader something to spank off to without tanking the credibility of his whole plot?Another eye-roller: Demmin Nass is Rahl's right-hand-man, built up as a total badass. He finally appears late in the book, capturing Kahlan, the female lead. Pretty intense... until Goodkind tells us Kahlan can turn Incredible Hulk, which she does, then dismembers Nass in about half a sentence. Imagine if late in Fellowship, Frodo casually tore a Nazgul limb from limb, Tolkien explaining, \"I forgot to mention, Frodo's a beast when he's angry.\" Wouldn't that suck? It does here, too. This book is embarrassingly bad Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is definitely the best fantasy series I've ever come across. The prose is excellent, everything is described in just enough detail so that the reader can adequately visualize the scenario, but not too much so as to bog down the significance of whatever is occurring with meaningless details. All of the characters are interesting and easy to \"get into\". The main character, Richard, could have easily fallen into the fantasy trap of bland and boring main character with no background suddenly having to save the world (think Rand from Wheel of Time or Shea from the Shannara series). Thankfully, Richard actually interests the reader! He has his own way of thinking and motivations that differentiate him from the other characters and actually highlight why he is able to lead everyone else, instead of just being \"the chosen one\" or whatever. The other major characters in the first chapter of this epic saga are Zedd, a former wizard, and Kahlan, the Mother Confessor of the midlands, which is not only a title of rank, but also sort of a \"character class\" (if you want to look at it from a gaming perspective) as the Confessors have a special ability which is wholely unique, and put to good use throughout the whole series. Although there are several major enemies lurking in the background that aren't wholly revealed until later books, the main baddy here is one Darken Rahl, an insane wizard of considerable power. Like Richard, Darken Rahl is in no way a boring or cardboard cut-out type character. The reader is given more details regarding Darken all the way through the series. Darken has a strange kind of insanity that makes complete sense to himself. It only seems natural to him that, being a being of great power like himself, he should have complete ownership of everything and everyone.This entire series is based on the philosophy of Objectivism by Ayn Rand. To better understand this series, I recommend reading \"For the New Intellectual\" by Ayn Rand. You will better understand the archetypes and themes Goodkind is shooting for when brother Narev and Emporer Jagang are introduced a little bit later in the series (the priest and the barbarian - the two components necessary to subjugate a society). Of course, if you wanted to take the idea further and extend it into reality, you could apply this same archetype to several prominent members of American government. Whether intentional or not, Goodkind's writing makes you think about more than swords and dragons.So far, every book in this series has managed to make me tear up a little, if not outright cry. You really start to lose yourself in the characters after a while. Towards the end, when Kahlan discovers that Richard is being held captive and tortured daily by a Mord-Sith, and it appears that all is lost and the whole group will be killed by Demmin Nas (Oh Demmin - the best fantasy villain of all time. I sincerely wish he hadn't been killed off as early as he was. Goodkind had the balls to actually present a villain that we truly reviled), Kahlan's primal scream of agony and anguish (combined with her shocking revelation of the magic of Kon Dar) were described in such perfect detail that I felt as though I was there. I could feel the horror and anguish within Kahlan slowly change to a simmering anger, which built to a full flung righteous wrath, demanding nothing less than the blood of Demmin Nas. The writing is done so well here that the reader can almost see the magic of Kon Dar explode out from Kahlan, swaying the trees and sending the pine needles flying, and then everything just stops for a dreadful moment when you realize something crazy intense is about to occur, and it does. What occurs next is highly reminiscent of the climax of the film \"28 Days Later\", when the main character becomes the physical embodiment of absolute rage, pulling out all the stops and absolutely destroying anything that comes between himself and his goal - which is the same in both the book and the film - to save the character's loved ones from certian doom.I was very suprised to read the other reviews of this book and discover that many people were supremely offended when they realized that this book had realistic depictions of battle, death, and even *gasp* torture! You guys seem to have stumbled into the wrong section of the library. You were supposed to go under that big archway over there - you know, the one with the little plastic river under it and styrofoam unicorns and a big, colorful sign that says \"Kids Section\". Yes everyone, there is in fact grown up material in this novel! Unbeliavable, isn't it? I find it strange that the more adult material in this book was specifically targeted by people as \"perverse and unnecessary\" as it seemed to me to be the exact opposite of that. The depictions of torture in this book, besides working on their own as a legitimate literary device to emotionally impact the reader, does in fact serve a greater purpose. The segment of the book where Richard is being held and tortured by the Mord-Sith gives us a deeper look into the character that is Richard - we begin to see who he really is under pressure and what he will develop into later on in the series when similar circumstances befall him again.I could go on for pages more about how great this series is. Pick this book up and find out for yourself. Thought Provoking, Well Paced, Excellent Detail. Great Book! Mildly engrossing at times, but the plot is pure soap opera. Not an uncommon problem in the fantsay genre, but each plot &quot;twist&quot; is apparent about 150 pages before hand. I struggled to reach the end and will not be finishing the series. There's far better stuff out there I first read this book as a young teenager in 1994. And I loved every page of it. I thought it was the best fantasy book ever written. I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars, because I still cherish that experience.Decades have passed since then, and I find my tastes have changed. WFR is still a fast-moving story with some fresh ideas, but when I read it now, I find the storytelling to be lazy and indulgent.It's still worth reading. Just have the right expectations. Expect to have fun, not have your world view altered. Time To Reflect Listen people, any one who gives the SoT series a bad rap needs to learn ONE THING. Terry Goodkind Is a Lawyer Not some Language Professor who spent his whole Life in The library Like warren in the palace of the prophets. So would you people BACK OFF!!! And another thing most of you are saying that he copies Robert Jorden's charecters and plots. Yet you Dont give an Example of what he ripped off... Helloo ,lighten up!! I have to say, I've never been so into a book series that I literally read until I fall asleep, and have to find my place in the book when I wake up in the morning! This was a wonderful book, and the ones to follow just get better! Of course there are some cliche parts, but it was still fantastic! A wonderful read! Terry Goodkind is one of the GREAT fantasy authors. If you're looking for a truly captivating story with vivid scene setting,fully developed characters, and a presentation that makes putting it down a serious challenge, then start here for the fantasy adventure of a lifetime. You'll want to continue through all eight books in the series. Book 1 of a dazzling series I decided to give this series a try. In the Netherlands the amount of Fantasy series is less then in some other countries, and this is one of the series that is in nearly every bookstore. So it probably sells decently. Now that unfortunately is not a measure of quality.What i did not like about this book! I am about 50 pages from the end, but decided to give my review anyway. For all i disliked its simplicity. There is one storyline. And only one! It all circles about our hero Richard. (Some very small diversions to other characters but those can be neglected) And some of the things that happen are very coincidental, like the finding of a certain magical object. A bit too coincidental in my opinion! Futhermore the author drags on some scenes until the point where i got the feeling &quot;Ok&eacute;, now we got the idea&quot;, like the whole Denna-thing. The whole concept/plot is rather cliche.But on the other hand. It is a fairly easy read. And i have seen worse. I'm not sure whether i will read on in the series. Maybe if the library has them, and i'm out of other thing to read. Mediocre! Loved this book, its fairly long, which is good it gives you time to get to know the characters. Its the classic good vs. evil story. Couldn't put it down Wizard's First Rule is a well put together story that will keep you flipping pages to get to the next chapter. I finished this book then moved on to Stone of Tears and am now reading Blood of the Fold. Each book contains themes that will be answered as the books unfold, but each book is complete with a satisfying ending and won't leave you hanging until the next book. I don't know how he does it but these books will make you want to spend more time outdoors instead of sitting in front of the TV. Also, Truth, Honor, and Loyalty and the ability to make hard decisions is a major focal point of these books. So if these things still matter to you, hop on board for a thrilling ride. Great Story Ignore the critics, they are never happy with anything, and read this book for yourself. You may just find yourself looking forward to the next. worth the read I received this from my son and although it took a few chapters to capture me, it certainly captured me well when it did. A great story with some unique character types within the framework of the often-seen. A book unafraid to show a hero AND a heroine as equally important to the story line and without the common \"Me da man, me musclebound\" type hero stuff normally encountered. Richard is every inch as desirable as a hero should be without the chest-beating or mind-warping melodrama often assigned to heroes. I quite enjoyed this book. Awesome First Novel Can't find too many clear-headed opinions on Terry Goodkind, or so it seems.Mr Goodkind is not the greatest author going, despite what the gushers say. His writing skills do need work. He doesn't paint pictures very well, except for the S&M; parts, which he describes rather too well. He does do his characters well, though, which is why I like the book.I'm pretty sure he writes fantasy to get his philosophical views across, though they aren't overbearing in this book.Mr Goodkind is not the worst writer on the planet, either, despite what the screamers say.It's a simple story about woods guide (Richard) who finds a woman (Kahlan) in the forest and begins an adventure. He visits new lands, meets interesting people and gains new responsibilities. There aren't any huge plot twists and not much suspense either, but for this story that is just fine. It's a pleasant, light read. If you're looking for the next Tolkien, you'll be disappointed (and angry, judging by some of the other reviews).The only major problem I had with this particular book is with the torture/S&M; that seems to go on for quite a long time. So if you're a responsible parent, your 12 year old SHOULD NOT BE READING THIS BOOK.Overall, I like this book a lot. I liked the way he did his characters and that made up for the not-so-good descriptions of places. One other nice thing is that while this is part of a long series, this book can stand alone on it's own. It's the best book in the series. Not great, but not trash either. On the surface this was a very simple and cliched fantasy novel, until the final couple hundred pages when Mistress Denna was introduced. At that point the work became more mature and sophisticated which I appreciate. What was most interesting about the novel wasn't the story, but the powerful questions it raised and the ongoing political dialogue.I feel the best books are books that force readers to ask questions about themselves and the world around them, and Wizard's First Rule succeeds at doing so. The first rule, which states \"people are stupid, they believe what they want to believe,\" forces readers to think about their own beliefs and values, and if the readers adhere to those values or belief systems because they have the facts to prove them, or if they believe them because they want to think they are true.Terry Goodkind's website indicates that The Sword of Truth series was written to express Goodkind's objectivist views, and is linked to the Ayn Rand Institute. Goodkind's website has an objectivist forum, where fans of the series discuss the virtues of libertarian capitalism, which is at the core of objectivist philosophy. Whether Goodkind intended this or not, Wizard's First Rule actually promotes Noam Chomsky's libertarian socialist views. For example the Queen of Tamarang is symbolic of what happens when societies adopt Rand's politics of libertarian capitialism, which is the politcs of nearly all Third World countries, where there is a seperation between government and economics. Whenever workers, in this case the peasants of the Midlands, lose their collective bargaining power, a few individuals seize control of most of the property and you are left with a rule by the rich, as was the case with the Queen and her rich pals in their relations with the poor farmers. Violet's lust for beheading peasants is symbolic of the objectivist absense of altruism. When people care only about maximizing profits, as objectivists argue they should, they don't care about the welfare of the poor. Trying to maximize profits and protect human rights is a contradiction that can't exist. Here in America shareholders can sue corporations for trying to be altruistic because it interferes with the shareholders moral and legal rights of making the most money possible. If Goodkind wanted to promote objectivism, then why are all the villians Randian?Richard and Kahlan are liberals. Richard doesn't want to be on the quest, but does so anyway because of altruism which Rand despises. Objectivists would blast Kahlan for being a socialist as she uses her govermental power to redistribute wealth and power, giving the poor workers more opportunities. In every instance of Wizard's First Rule, where governmental corruption takes place, the focus is pointing out the negative attributes of hierarchical power that libertarian socialists see as being in the way of human rights. Throughout the novel readers are given examples of where the rich have power and the poor don't, and human rights abuses are commited, which is the end result of the implementation of Randian politics.It's worth pointing out that in this post 9/11 world, no adult will be able to read Wizard's First Rule without comparing Darken Rahl to George W. Bush, and the People's Party to the Republican Party. Like Darken, Bush is a charismatic and charming figure that people want to put their trust in, just like the people from the Midlands and D'Hara, but Rahl's Randian persuit of self interest ends up destroying the lives of many of his own people, and also the people he invades (parallels to U.S. and Iraq abound).I really enjoyed this book as a work of philosophy, and the story made the philosophy much more readable than standard philosophical treatises. More Noam Chomsky Than Ayn Rand WOW! Even though I'm only eleven and it took me a full nine days to read this (Well, technically ten, I had to stay up past twelve o'clock on the last night to finish it) I think it's great. Of course it's not written for kids my age and all, but I think it rocks. I concurr with other people: I was glad that this book is what it is beacause I finish books faster than I can buy them or check them out of the library and it becoames *AGGRAVATING*. I highly reccomemnd this book...but a warning: it has a few &quot;bad&quot; things in it. It's worth it, though...I would say. Read this if you like fantasy...or even if you don't! Is Terry Goodkind a man or a woman? I also must praise Zedd...he's extremely FUNNY! Well, maybe not extremely, but I liked him a good deal. Read this book! Interesting... Normally I despise fantasy books with the exception of Tolken's Lord of the Rings. A friend of mine recommended this book and I have to say it was excellent. I could not put it down. The characters were well developed though I have to say in the end there was one scene where my only reaction was \"WHAT?\" Goodkind is a good writer but there are some scenes in this text that one can do without, ie the scenes with the Deanna, the Mord-Sith, were prolonged and slightly too involved and explicit for my tastes. With the exceptions of these scenes, the overall writing style was great. The story was well developed and a good prelude to the rest of the series. I would highly recommend reading this book though the length is somewhere in the 800 or so pages. Highly recommended Wizards First Rule was a horrible mess of a book. There was absolutely no charactur development, and I could really care less what hapened to them. Dont start this series because they are all aweful. Read books by J.R.R Tolkien, George R.R.Martin because those are much better written then The Sword of Truth series. Horrible book! I started with tv series n am now on too the books n I'm hooked way better than the show I hated in the show that Richard n kaylan were kept apart can't wait too see how it work out with them together on to the next book love it love it love it yipeeeee Amazing This book is the beginning to what has to be one of the greatest series ever written. I personally loved this book but it's only a start and the farther in the series you get the better it becomes. Goodkind questions, pokes and prods at modern society giving praise to individuality and original ways of thinking. If you've read any Robert Jordan and liked it you'll love Terry Goodkind because the two series are easily comparable and both are amazing. A great beginning. I have a very literate friend that always berated sci-fi fantasy books as trash literature. Until I read this book I never really quite understood what it was that she saw in them that she found so offensive. This book is quite literally trash. Characters constantly burst into cliched conversations about love and friendship, and they continuously act and react in ways that fit the plot but are totally out of character and or without sufficient motivation. The writing is horrendous. Never have I cringed so much at poor writing than I did when I read this book. I know of course that it must take a lot of talent to be able to fill 800+ pages, but still the writing stinks.With that said, this is however actually a pretty interesting book. It starts off incredibly slow; I think that Goodkind must have assumed that readers would be so immediately enchanted by his main characters that they wouldn't notice the lack of plot in the first half of the book. It does, however, really start to pick up the pace towards the middle of the book, and by the end you won't be able to put it down. The story is typical fantasy; a back woods guy has a chance meeting with a mysterious woman that results in a series of events that will determine the fate of the world. Nothing really new here. If you can get over the aforementioned cliched dialogue and completely unmotivated actions, the characters are pretty interesting and likeable.I have read a couple of the books that follow in this series and while they suffer from the same aforementioned problems they are more interesting than this first novel and thus make reading the series worthwhile. All in all, I would have to say that if you are interested in reading a long series, and don't really care if your brain will turn into mush, then the Sword of Truth novels are not a bad choice. I would however recommend Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" series instead. A pretty interesting piece of fantasy trash The good things about this book are Goodkind's crafty use of words, the memorable characters and its readability. However, these strengths are outweighed by the fact that the story moves too slowly as you often find yourself waiting for something of importance to happen. If an author is going to write a book of this length, he or she must be sure to keep the plot moving--Goodkind fails in this respect. Also, Goodkind goes beyond an average level of violence to images and events that are graphic, vile and just plain disgusting. What is worse is that these scenes have little bearing on the plot and just seem to be included for shock value. I don't recommend this book because it just isn't worth the time. Not enough story for its size Ok I am not going to try and compare this to the Wheel of Time series. The main reason being that I have never read the Wheel of Time series, although I plan on it. I have heard of the similarities and all I say is I don't care. This is hands down one of the best books I have ever read. I can't say it is my favorite because there are 6 books in the series and they are all equally fantastic. I have never cared about characters in a book as much as I care about these characters. I could not stop reading it. I read the last 600 pages in one day. I was hooked. As for Dragonlance, I think is is a great series, but nowhere close to SoT. This book has action galore, it is intelligent, and it never loses its focus. You find yourself rooting for the characters and holding your breath as you turn the page. You have to view this series apart from Jordan's. Even if he did borrow ideas, who cares? These books are so great I would reccomend them to anyone. Go read it, you will not regret it. Start Respecting 6 Years ago I bought this book,I read 20/30 pages and thought &quot;potboiler&quot;.In year 2000 that word still applies.If you have read any classic/cult fantasy in the last 20 years,then this book should be avoided.Why you ask?,well it is for those of you who read,David Eddings,Terry Brookes,Raymond Feist,Robert Jordan and that never ending stream of sausage factory Tolkein clones.Of course this may just be your bag,but if you want thought provoking fantasy,try the works of Robert Holdstock,Jan Seigel(Prosperos Daughters),Terry Windling,Charles de Lint,Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett(aka Lord Dunsany) And of course you could always read LOTR again for the 20th time.The worst thing about this type of series is that once you have bought the first you feel bound to buy the rest,in the vain hope things will get better.Just like Robert Jordans door stoppers,which by all accounts do not.Therefore, in summary we have a book which fulfils all the needs of the mainstream fantasy market,without really pushing back the boundaries(no pun intended)of fantasy writing.The style of writing maybe grittier and more involved,but it does not matter how many times you repaint and touch up an automobile,it's still the same beaten up piece of junk you bought 20 years ago. Nothing That Has Not Been Seen Before I can't believe the praises other reviewers have posted here. The book is way too long, underedited, in fact. The author wasted a good number of pages explaining things that are obvious to readers. This style may be beneficial to young fans but with themes like pedophilia and sado-masochism, it is clearly a mature book without the mature writing style. Yes, Mr. Goodkind is inventive in his plot twists and characterizations, the overall plot is a cliche. He also crammed the interesting parts near the end. As a result, the ending was rushed since too many important events are happening without much explanation. Probably because he devoted too much time on the little things (a crime the Wheel of Time series is also guilty of). I'd rather read Feist's books. Even if the plots are cliche, they are still good reading... Overrated I have all the books in this series and they are falling apart from constant reading. This way they won't wear out. Goodkind People usually say that Goodkind has a lot in common with Jordan.The only thing I think he has in common with him is his ridiculously long books.Otherwise there are not as many pointless characters,the magic is as in depth as Terry Brooks,and the plot is fast moving and gripping.Richard Cypher,an unsuspecting person in the Westland,suddenly saves a mysterious woman called Kahlan Amnell,who tells him some disturbing news:Darken Rahl(the evil dude)has two of the boxes of Orden and is searching for the third one.She has come to the Westland searching for the only wizard powerful enough to destroy Darken Rahl.When the wizard turns out to be Richard's old friend Zedd,Zedd appoints him Seeker and gives him the mission to destroy Darken Rahl.This is a tale of romance,adventure,and wonderful magic .Buy it. Splendid. I can understand, to a certain extent, the popularity of this series. It provides a fairly well done presentation of standard fantasy conceits and themes - a common man who becomes a hero, the old wizard, the evil master who is on the verge of conquering the world of good people, and the quest to defeat him via a powerful artifact or artifacts. These themes do work quite well - they resonate with readers on a very basic level. The problem, though, is that they have been literally done to death in the fantasy genre. In fact, the themes listed are those of the seminal high fantasy (swords and sorcery, if you will) text, Lord of the Rings. They have been reworked and repeated again and again - by Terry Brooks, by Robert Jordan, and by many others.Goodkind gains an advantage in his presentation by claiming not to be a fantasy author in the traditional fantasy, not a part of the clique, if you will. This may make him more approachable to those not accustomed to reading the genre, but it masks the fact that, when it comes right down to it, his series is in fact quite typical and even pedestrian (save, perhaps, in its very graphic violence). It's themes - even in detail - seem cribbed from other works (Jordan and Brooks in particular, but experienced readers will see Martin and Tolkien as well). Perhaps this is not unexpected, if one accepts these themes as archetypal in fantasy literature, and many of them are.But this very fact in the end demonstrates why Goodkind's series is really nothing special. It breaks almost no new ground in fantasy literature. In fact, much of modern fantasy - even high fantasy - overturns or twists the very archetypes Goodkind (apparently unknowingly) embraces, attempting to present a new perspective on the usual expectations. Though Goodkind's popularity stems from the fact that he - and his expected audience - do not know that his works fall into long established trends within the genre, his series must still be judged against those other works. Goodkind's assertion that he is not a fantasy author or fan does not mean he cannot be compared to other fantasy literature.Examined in this way, Goodkind's series - and this book in particular - cannot be seen as anything except second rate. The themes have been done and redone before. The writing itself is not noteworthy, rarely rising above the level of a pulp novel. In fact, the emphasis on graphic violence, the broad, simplistic, and stereotypical characterizations, and the pedestrian presentation all fit quite neatly into this category. Its themes, as discussed above, are typical fantasy fare, with almost nothing except minor detail to differentiate them. In fact, in many of these minor details one is reminded again of pulp literature - Goodkind's villian, Darken Rahl, has many aspects in common with classic comic supervillians.Certainly there is nothing inherently wrong with following the established boundaries of a genre, but at the same time any author who does so must exceed expectations with his or her work. He or she needs to present a story better crafted and more finely wrought than those of hsi or her predecessors. After all, those predecessors are the ones who first defined the limits of the genre, creating something new in the process - a writer who is following those footsteps cannot be noteworthy unless he or she surpasses those who came before. Goodkind fails in this; in fact, I would classify his work as pulp fantasy, akin to dozens of similar works - certainly nothing special or noteworthy within the genre.I do think that Goodkind's series is noteworthy for fantasy in one respect, however. In presenting it as literature first and fantasy second, Goodkind manages to break out of the literary ghetto fantasy literature has traditionally been placed in. As I stated before, this is the source of its popularity. But the real benefit of it, as I see things, is that once readers begin to compare Goodkind's works to what already exists within that ghetto, they will realize that fantasy literature in general isn't as tripe or absurd as is commonly believed (even though Goodkind's series will also be shown as nothing more than pulp fiction). The contribution of Goodkind's work, I expect, will be to reveal that fantasy literature does contain great works that deserve to be judged against \"standard\" literature on equal footing. Certainly, its legacy won't be to \"redefine\" the genre. The fact that Goodkind believes he is doing so, and that his series breaks new ground in fantasy, simply reveals how ignorant he is of the genre. Goodkind hasn't read fantasy? It shows. OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; READ: 2000 (revised review early April 2012).CONCEPT: A young woodsman is chosen as the Seeker, a long lost position of power given to a warrior of ultimate good in distant lands. Now, he must go to those distant lands to face the Evil controlling it, as well as to deal with issues of truth. Along his journey, his position is tested as his love for his new lady love. (This didn't hit me as big of a concept as say HUMA or THE HOBBIT. But, it attracted a lot of fantasy readers, who tend to be more thinkers, and it holds a great deal of promise). MARKETING APPEAL: This story dealt with archetypes and LEVEL ONE readers; it was above average of most fantasy novels; used archetypes and the mythical Hero's Quest to appeal; good characters and focus on context; less on plot and surprises. Richard was very noble and easy to anger when faced with lies or difficult appeal; I think this resonated with many readers who are tired of the BS in our society and desire simpler times; characters are interesting but only on a simple level; if you want gray characters and profound thinking and interactions, you won't get it in this series. I suspect this is a VERY HEAVY LEVEL ONE series.SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)DIALOGUE: B STRUCTURE: B HISTORY SETTING: A- CHARACTERS: A- EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: C+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B+ SURPRISES: B MONSTERS: A- PACING: B LITTLE THINGS: B OVERALL STYLE: B FLOW OF WORDS: B CHOICE OF FOCUS: B TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B+ COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: BOVERALL GRADE: B to B+OVERALL STRUCTURE: Spent a lot of time building up the characters. This is much more a story of context and characters than of plot or fast action. A great deal of time is spent playing off the character relationships, describing the landscape and people and monsters and also in laying out the History. And actually, the History is pretty interesting as are the monsters. There were several character revelations which weren't surprising in this novel since it was so character focused. A few surprises and such, too. Richard Cypher is a good and moral character. Perhaps a bit too much. He is the typical innocent yet good youth (from mythology) who sets out on a mission where the odds seem insurmountable.WHY IT WORKED FOR ME: As described above, the monsters were orchestrated nicely into the ecology. The dragon character was fresh enough and the description of the travels along the wilderness were interesting. The interplay between Richard and Kahlan kept my interest. Enough tug and pull and conflict. Zedd was introduced naked which was interesting and new. He wasn't stereotypical either and had enough of his own lines to make him stand out more. Also, he wasn't some big buffed dude. I liked the way he manipulated in a good sense towards other people to achieve some better end, but still felt bad over it. The viewpoint of using a child and changing the word usage was good, too. The villain wasn't different but interesting enough. The sexual debauchery made them even worse. No doubt this was to create moral outrage. Have to say Richard is no warrior in the first novel but that's okay. He seemed to get out of jams enough times. Not clever. More noble and good that he gets others to help him as in the case of the Dragon. Interesting how Richard went through pain whenever he took a human life and had to deal with the results. Magic, in other words, has its limitations. Great details of the world and History; in regards to the lands being divided into three areas; the red fruit that is poisonous in the magical lands; the illusions used to fool the hero and heroine; the limitation of magic users; the confessor development and History; the Seekers and info. on their creation; the ecology of the monsters was something new and entertaining (many fantasy books forget that there are so many monsters that the ecological system would be destroyed); great interplay between the lovers even though some of the dialogue was a bit simple at times on Richard's part (of course, he's supposed to be a simple character so I won't hold this against the author). Pay attention to some of the names: DARKEN RAHL (for evil) and Richard Cypher (for DECIPHER since he's a seeker of truth). Those are the main ones which come to mind but I'm sure there are others. Also interesting were the little phrases that permeated the storyline, giving it texture. For instance, Zedd the high wizard had the best ones: \"Nothing is every easy.\" and \"Bags!\" (a swear word). One other thing I found interesting in relation to truth was Wizard's First Rule: \"People are stupid and will believe what they want to believe.\" This came in handy during the story when many of the townfolk were told to blame the good people for their problems and used those good people as scapegoats. So too, Richard's people were told that the magic lands were dangerous to their well being and created an army to put an end to it. It's little points such as this, as well as blends with style, that pushed this up from a solid B to a B+. It would have gotten even higher if the themes of truth had been elaborated upon more so. Why not have someone who is compelled to tell the truth all the time in difficult situations to show the flip side of being honest? Psychologists tells us that our society couldn't exist if everyone told the truth b/c it would come across as tactless and because most people aren't good at taking conflict or criticism. While being honest with your intimate partner is an ideal, being honest in the workforce or with people you hardly know can sometimes be destructive. Too much self disclosure to such types looks bad and weak. Another area that I felt was missed on truth was to develop the local populace opinions on what they felt was right. While Goodkind did a good job with it, I felt he could have really mined this area more to make it more thought provoking.FLAWS: Too much introspection can turn some readers off. The discussion of truth wasn't taken far enough or really hammered into the them big time. The part about Richard being a bastard child of the villain was revealed a bit late and made it anticlimatic. Perhaps it was intended and the next book will tell. The story lacked surprises. There were certainly a few but not enough for such a long novel. As I said above, it was more of a page turned for appreciation of the characters than a great moving story with lots of surprises and mysteries to it. It tended to be formulaic in the quest and perhaps it would have done Goodkind well to hold back some of the information of the story rather than reveal too much up front as he did. COMMENTS: A lot of details to characters and somewhat of a hit on truth and what is truth. For those interested in such areas, it's an entertaining read. I wouldn't advise this for people who don't like innocent, good hearted youths (since Richard dominates most of the text), or people who are more interested in a plot driven fantasyGRADE REASON: I am giving this an at the cusp B+ (higher than I give most fantasy novels) for the reasons listed above). The fact that Goodkind followed the typical mold of the innocent, good youth on a quest doesn't really place it any higher because it follows a typical pattern that has been done over and over by fantasy authors. So too, the love story got melodramatic at certain points (losing the feeling of this being love than just effects) and there weren't as many surprises as I felt there should have been. However, it had some truly amazing characters in it, even if parts of the love story got irritating at times. Moreover, the history setting of the land divisions, the rules on magic, the History of seekers, confessors and wizards, as well as the ecologically sound monsters pumped it up pretty high. There were certain points where it lagged at times, but perhaps that is attributed to the required page count of novels at a 1000 pages now. Very long. Geesh. It probably would have gotten a solid B+ or even an A- if Terry had analyzed more issues of truth and really pushed the limits upon the characters. However, since there was so much story to cover, I can see why there were problems in doing so. Perhaps additional books will cover these matters in the future. Of course, he would have had to develop his Evil antagonist beyond a caricature, too. I think it should be mentioned that Goodkind is dyslexiac and spends something like 12 hours a day working on his books (6 or 7 days a week). The man is obviously driven. Some have claimed he stole many ideas from Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME (I only read the first book in the series and found the passive male characters and constant meandering not to my liking) but I don't see this as much as they claim. If anything, I would take Goodkind over Jordan since there's more thinking in the head. It is no surprise to me, however, that this book broke the record and Terry was awarded $275,000 for the first novel. There are a lot of great ideas in here, as well as characters (if Richard's simple philosophies are not viewed as abhorrent) and it delivers on several components of the genre. All in all, this is much better than perhaps 75% of the fantasy books I have read in the past. MY GRADE: B to B plus. Every once in a while something special happens...Often you have no control over that event, occasionally you do.If you want to read something that will leave you spellbound (pun intended), and asking yourself questions way after the book is complete then this is the novel for you.As much an encapsulation of most popular genres of fiction all rolled into one this book is not for the faint hearted, containing many suspenseful scenes, much horror and gore, packed with drama and a beuatiful love story in the making.Be warned the novel is quite lengthy, and may have you burning the midnight oil to reach its dazzling conclusion.Goodkind has an uncanny and rare talent for making you care about the fate of the characters and leaving each chapter craving you for more. Additionally, there is a fantastic fan based site on www.terrygoodkind.com where you are welcomed to discuss and debate all aspects of the book.This is the first novel in the 'Sword of Truth' Series and the tenth (including a brief prequel) is soon to hit the shops.Some people might be put off by the length of the novel (over 700 pages) but almost from the onset its an incredible tale and one which continues to build as the adventure unfolds.Some people might compare elements in the storyline to 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars' or a few other classics. I'd beg to differ - Its a tale that works on so many levels - there is an underlying philosophical structure, a multi layed intricately woven storyline and something that will appeal to teenagers and adults alike, each finding much to appease their interest.Try it for yourself.. what have you got to lose? Suspense, Drama, Romance, Horror, Fantasy...its all here! The story and the writing style are excellent. The problem is that Mr. Goodkind likes to wallow in depravity. While many other modern authors (eg, Robert Jordon, Guy Gavriel Kay) also deal with cruelty, torture, sexual perversions and the like, they use it to show evil for what it is and &quot;go on.&quot; Goodkind, however, writes continually about it, focusing on it like some extremely unhealthy obsession with a death camp and its methods.Again, the story is good and the writing is lucid, but he leaves you feeling very dirty afterwords. Good writing, but extremely perverse This is, simply put, the junk-food equivalent of the fantasy world. If you seek semi-intelligent reading, this is not a book for you. The ridiculously derivative plot allows an experienced fantasy reader to guess nearly if not all plot \"twists\". Fantasy for the feeble-minded It has an interesting and inventive story but is executed poorly. The writing is so bad it makes me want to throw it into a fire. The only thing that keeps me going is the story. It is a shame that the editors didn't have enough guts to get the author to rewrite or bring someone else in to co-author. Case in point: When Richard is going to Zedd's house we are told that the \"old mans house was to far to reach before dark and the trail too treacherous to travel at night.\" But when they leave the house 100 pages later, \"It was an easy trail, almost a road.\" If this is not the same trail, then why not take it in the first place? This is a slight example of a regular occurrence. Don't start this book unless you want to know first hand what bad writing is. Horrible writing This book was amazing. It had so much character development, and it really kept you reading till the last page.The next few books in the series were pretty good, the second equally as, but then it started to drag on a bit...The main character Richard started to seem a little too perfect. So if you want to start reading a complete series, I wouldn't reccomend this book, but if you want to just read a great fanatsy, then this is the one for you. My favorite fantasy book I read this book years ago before I read Jordan's books. It is still fun to listen to, but wow did he copy all of Jordan's ideas? Good book The only reason that I even bother saying anything about this book (or shall I call it a piece of junk?), is because almost every reviewer of this book likes it! I can say countless bad things about this book (the names, the descriptions, the bad atmosphere, the wierd characters and lots of more), but I'll concentrate on the major problem of this book (or is it in fact Goodkind's problem?):There is so much graphic violence, sex, torture and other disgusting things that is in this book! I feel pity for all the young boys (or girls) that have read this book, mainly because of the perverted Demin Nass who favours young boys!!!!!!!!!! What the hell is this Goodkind? Is this the kind of thoughts that are created in your mind?There are countless other perverted parts and other things that I would not like to mention, I believe that you all know what I mean. This is firewood, not a good book! While I'll admit that it is not the most original concept in the world; Evil wizard, exotic women, magic sword; He takes such basic concept and makes them his own. But thats not the strength of this book. Goodkind is a master philosipher and really relays a powerful message in all of his books. He makes you really feel for the characters. All in all Goodkind is a master in the genre and doesn't get the respect he deserves. Truly a Masterpiece Who can read this DRIVEL? Poorly written, with an almost juvenile writing style. Boring. Predictable. The interactions between the Kahlen and Richard, laughable. They have known each other for, um, one day, and already she has \"a secret smile just for him!\" Ugh. I kept reading parts of it out loud to my family and LAUGHING! I had to quit after about 100 pages. I am surprised I managed to get that far and shocked that this is a bestseller. Compares in my mind to the Eragon books by Christopher Paolini, except his are written by a teen, and for a pre-teen and teen audience. Still can't stand them, though. I would skip this book without hesitation. does it count if I couldn't finish it? Go buy George R.R. Martin, or even L.E. Modesitt instead; you'll thank me later. There are SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, kind of.1) Characters are *constantly* changing their tone. They'll use stiff language one sentence, shunning all use of contractions, then use contractions left and right the next sentence. I hate this. It detracts from their believability -- characters should have a consistent feel to them, and if their speech is stilted and distant in one sentence, their speech should continue to be stilted and distant. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, which there aren't in this case.2) Plot elements are thrown in willy-nilly. I like a good plot progression. I enjoy good writing. I hate it when an author smacks my head with a ten pound hammer to get a plot element across -- Zedd's a WIZARD?! Who would have guessed? Goodkind makes it nicely obvious, then (in case you missed it), makes it explicit, then (just in case you're a ...) has the protagonist talk about it alot.3) Logical consistency is lacking. The concept of the boundary is logically inconsistent with the heart hounds, the timing of the boundary makes no sense in relation to Zedd's being the high wizard or Darken Rahl's appearance, etc. etc. etc. It's been THREE GENERATIONS, folks. People who were around *BEFORE THE BOUNDARY* are still alive. Why are the characters so surprised by each other?4) The writing is inconsistent. One second Zedd will be giving a wonderful exposition of how a Seeker should act, the next his language is muddled and he's calling people 'dear one'. What up?I'm running out of space. This book bothered me -- the pubescent love-at-first-sight [stuff], the instant friendliness. There's a quote on the jacket from Marion Zimmer Bradley saying this book would \"sweep the country as Tolkien's work did...\" Good Lord, I hope not. What a waste of time that would be.- Andrew inconsistent & badly written, but with good potential Wizard's First Rule is a great start to the Sword of Truth books, Goodkind is a master at his writing. Had me at hello! At first read, Goodkind's book comes across as derivative. In fact, you'll make the inevitable comparisons to Tolkien, Jordan, Eddings, and others. While there are obvious nods to the above-mentioned it must be mentioned that the 'best' in the genre rip off from older traditions. Look at Joseph Campbell's writings on myth and its framework to see what I mean. Consider that the formula of 'farmboy-turns-saviour (even god?)' is used to effect by the above-mentioned, and has even been recycled as space opera in George Lucas' original 'Star Wars' films. Ditto for the Harry Potter series and alot of Disney's successful films, and you'll also find that Herbert's \"Dune\" (which is ostensibly a 'scifi' epic) is structured using this very same template.Let's face it folks... Goodkind's opening formula is NOT original, and has not been since that bygone day when Man first started telling stories. Hell, that's part of what makes it so good, and which makes the cycle worthy of standing amid the ranks of fantasy literature's luminaries. Does that make it bad? Absolutely NOT.All that being said, the second half of this book WILL throw you for a loop. Once the archetypal set-up is out of the way, it soon becoms apparent that the hero is both vunerable and fallible, not to mention weak on many levels, and Goodkind exploits these vulnerablilites to effect.I guarantee that by the middle act of \"Wizard's First Rule\" you'll be as flabbergasted about its outcome as I was. Goodkind takes these plot twists and builds upon them, and he's not shy about using more 'twists' in subsequent volumes of his series. I'm halfway through Book IV of the Sword of Truth cycke, and I have yet to be disappointed, but it has been a fun ride the entire time.Pick up this book. You'll be pleased. That's my affirmation of Truth. (wink) First impression isn't always correct.... This comment is for Kindle readers only, who do not get Amazon reviews.I have been intrigued by the popularity of this series for a long time. So, when I saw it become available on the kindle, I purchsed it since I love fantasy. I have started it recently and it seems like pretty standard fantasy so far. I amwriting this now becausw Amazon deleted a Kindle review which was very helpful to me as it allowed me to set my expectations much more appropriately and also let me understand this story ccould be read on a standalone basis and the later books disappointed many readers. So I suggest you read some of the more balanced reviews on Amazon. I stilll bought the book, but with much different expectations. I hope that Amazon leaves this Kindle review posted since the other one helped me. Read The Reviews On Amazon Website - For Kindle Readers Do not fear. You can pick up Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time seriesThe Wheel of Time (Boxed Set #1)and read what Terry Goodkind horribly tried to imitate. If you read them both you see what I mean. I did not believe the Wheel of Time was as great as everyone said but I enjoyed quite a bit and find myself waiting for each new book. The characters have more depth, the story line makes sense, and the action is realistic. Goodkind's characters just do whatever they need to to continue what almost passes as a story line. They do not follow descriptions or previous actions or dialogs. It reads like a child cheating at a role playing game. Great fantasy writing in English has one name, George R. R. Martin.A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1) Place on shelf and back away quickly Let me start by saying, \"What a FANTASTIC story!\" I am not an avid reader... it is rare that I pick up any fictional title. I mostly read non-fiction books if I read anything at all. I actually listened to the audio book during my lengthy car rides to/from work, over lunch, over dinner, while walking the dog, while going to sleep, etc. I lived deep within this book for over 30 hours, and loved nearly every minute of it.Rage, Love, Hate, Passion, Truth, Lies, Betrayal, Devotion, Triumph, Failure, Fear, Terror, Suspense, Anger and Pain are the many facets of this book. Invoking groans, laughs, discomfort, disgust, and compassion are some of Terry Goodkind's talents. I highly recommend this book (especially the audiobook) to anyone interested in starting a LONG series in this magical world of fantasy.In my relatively limited experience with fantasy novels, the characters are amazingly intelligent and observant, yet painfully slow to realize/act... often deliberating on some critical issue to the extreme. I found myself generally getting ahead of the character's thoughts... often knowing the answer to their problems before the author gets around to spitting it out. Don't get me wrong, I like knowing that I'm right, and I honestly think that agreeing with a character before they make up their mind makes one more empathetic with that character (perhaps what Goodkind intended all along). The lead characters are richly entertaining; each with a unique, albeit conveniently noble, history/lineage. Much of the book is predictable; not to say there were no twists, because I was misled as many times as I was on track.Goodkind really does make the characters come to life... you love and cheer for Richard, you wish you could wrap your arms around and gaze at the stunningly beautiful Kahlen, wish you could discuss philosophy with Zedd, and wish you could decapitate any number of villains (which I think he paints better than all the rest). Villains are deliciously evil in this book, perverting the idea of power over others (especially those who are helpless/defenseless), pushing the limits of reckless disregard for others' wellbeing, and poignantly portraying how corruptible political leaders can be. I am particularly impressed with how well Goodkind is able to make me disgusted with a young princess in the middle part of the book... I'd say more but I don't want to give anything away.I enjoyed how original the magic of this world seemed to me, and although I haven't started book 2 (I will tomorrow), I assume there will be much more to learn about the various different magics described in the first book. I also enjoyed the creatures in this book as they were familiar (like dragons) to non-typical night-wisps, deathly shadow creatures, even a carnivorous creature with a symbiotic relationship with blood-flies to help them locate their next meal...Overall it was a fantastical book with a good albeit \"typical\" fantasy plot... what really makes this book are the devious and perverse enemies, laughable and loveable heroes and the authors ability to craft suspense between sub-plots... and how could it not, there are so many hundreds of pages that I can't imagine this book not covering a little of everything. Predictable & Unpredictable; Imaginative meets Tried and True I stumbled upon Terry's work accidentally. I workout a lot and like to listen to books while I workout, so I was looking for a very long book to listen to...and I stumbled upon \"Wizard's First Rule\" by Terry Goodkind, which had over 30 hours of listening time. As I listened to the book I became enraptured with the characters and the storyline. I told my parents about this wonderful author by the name of Terry Goodkind and his Sword of Truth novels. My parents started the series - and have been fans ever since. Around the time I was finishing \"Stone of Tears\" (the second book in the series) I was having difficulty with my middle son. He started acting out, getting into trouble at school, bad grates, etc. He was diagnosed as ADD/ADHD when he was a young child so I have always struggled to keep him focused. As a form of \"punishment\" for acting out, he had to read out loud to me. I chose \"Wizard's First Rule\". He would read a page, I would read a page, and so on and so on...this would continue for an hour every night. On the third night he picked up the book, took it into his room and read without me. He informed me that he couldn't wait for me and that an hour a night was not enough. My son finished the series and has been an avid fan of Terry's since the first book...as has the rest of my family. My son is now in the Marines - and although he could have chosen many directions in the Marines, he has chosen to be an infantryman. Terry's books have captured my families interest and are inspirational. Also, I have three nephews that also have read and love Terry's books. Captured When I first picked up this book I was looking for a hefty tome to keep me enthralled for a good long while. It's easier than finding something new to read a few days later. This book fit that description and promised future volumes with which to enchant me. Great. I could only hope now that it was a good series and we had a winner.Well this first book was truly great. I enjoyed it immensely and finished it in a little over a week. That's pretty good shelf life for me. I went out and bought the next book in the series, still good but not AS good. Onto number three, ok now there is a definate downhill slide that gets progressively worse as the stories continue. I was soooo disappointed, I really liked the first book and was truly eager to read a great big long series (at that time I think Goodkind was on book Six) and get lost in a different world. And I tried too! I kept reading them all despite my lack of interest, all the way up to book five and it just didn't get better, only worse. So I can't speak for future volumes of the saga but if you make it that far then you are a much more patient person than I.My advice would be to read this book, because it is very good, but leave it at that. You don't have to read any more of them for this to have a satisfying end. Of course there is the obligatory refernces that the evil wasn't completely destroyed, but hey you can just pretend it was. Because it was still alive in some form as far as book five and giving it that old geriatric try. The monotony was more frightening.I hope this was helpful. The Best Book In The Series Bought this a number of years ago and only read a few pages. Then picked it up again and read through at upwards of a couple of hundred pages in a day. Agree with the comments about writing style but did not want to look ahead to his later volumes to see if his style has matured, and so my comments are specific to just this novel. Also agree the plot had many elements of other fantasy novels as well, though it also had some interesting twists. As some have pointed out, it starts out like it is written for young readers, but towards the end becomes very adult in its content.Yet in the end, it had me page turning for hours on end so clearly it easily held my interest. Despite issues of his writing style, he gets one critical element right. Fantasy series such as by a number of English writers flood you with too many characters too quickly. The result is you lose the plot trying to remember who a particular character is and why you should care. Goodkind introduces characters and then spends enough time that you remember them the next time they show up. This helps the plot move along at a good reading pace.There were enough twists, turns, and surprises to balance out the groaners. Remembering that this was the first novel in the series, the real question is whether you would want to read the next. I usually alternate series, but in this case, I am moving into Volume 2 right away. Four starts for the first novel flaws, but otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable reading. Long Overdue Reading Assignment The Wizard's First Rule is an excellent book that created a very believable alternate world with a relucant hero who uses strong character traits to win the respect of all with whom he works or battles. He is exceptionally believable in his behavior and holds to his values, making him an exceptional character. The story has some great twists and turns that are totally unexpected. The ending is exceptionally satisfiying, to the point I have gone back a reread it a few times just to relive the satisfaction.This was my first experience with this author, but certainly not my last. He is on my list up there with Orson Scott Card for writing the most believable fantsy with well-crafted characters. Finely crafted writing This book had potential. But turned me off with the sadistic torture of children. Unnecessary. One of the reviews on the cover compare it to the work of Tolkien. That is a stretch. Wizard's First Rule this book is great. Up to par with Tolkien. An amazing storyline and an amazing ending. Two-thumbs up. Excellent book, never read anything like it If you like a well written fable of a young man who grows into his manhood with liberal sprinklings of magic, swordfights, adventures and a bit of romance then this is for you. This is a totally engrossing story which will whisk you away to a far land where you can spend many happy hours exploring and living the life of a hero. I'm not going to tell you the ending but the hero ........... Do Heroes always win in the end? Mild spoiler alerts in this review. A standard fantasy structure: humble young protagonist who grows into the hero he was meant to be, opposes powerful evil ruler, aided by magical companions, motivated by a deep romantic love and a world-saving calling, on a long journey through detailed, beautiful, and treacherous landscapes, and undergoing various sub-quests along the way. The author has a penchant for manipulative and graphic sado-masochistic scenes, and there's quite a bit of fantasy violence and endurance that exceeds credibility, but what else would one expect? Goodkind is striving for a balance of believability and world consistency within his premise. I often find the promise more enticing than the product; some of his ideas were intriguing, such as the boundaries between the worlds, and the drama of passing through the boundaries. Goodkind's Ayn Rand-ian views came off well when voiced as wizardly lore. This is the first book of a long series, and I felt it tried to do too much; the ending was too convenient to be satisfying. I felt less and less engaged as I read through this book, and by the end I was not inclined to read more in this series. I read the whole thing, despite liking it less and less This whole series is one which will be a classic as the Tolkien books. Terry Goodkind's ability to make a novel so real you can see the event happening as you read. I could not put any of these books down. Thank you, Terry for many hours of breathtaking enjoyment. Exceptional Series This the first book in a huge saga of books that follows the tale of Richard Cypher and the start of his epic tale and the meaning behind what is happening to him. I first found out about this series watching season one of the Sword of Truth tv series and I wanted to read the series after that. After reading this book I realized that this is an amazing story. The author isn't afraid to write about anything, which can make this quite interesting.Even though it may seem as a straight forward evil versus bad type of book, it does have its grey areas and I think it really expands upon Richard as a person. He goes to a ton of places throughout the story and he does have various combat situations that pop up and can become really intense. It all leads to a very satisfying conclusion.The writing and editing IMO are well done. I read through the 800 pages seamlessly and didn't have to stop reading due to bad writing. The quality of the book is pretty well and even though it had a bunch of creases in the middle after I read it, it didn't fall apart or I lose any pages.If you're a fan of middle ages themed book with a great story and tons of action, I recommend this book to you. I really enjoyed this book and the great start to a long series of books. Start of Richard Cyphers epic tale For some reason, this is one of those books that people have strong opinions about. I scanned through many of the reviews of WFR and was suprised to find quite a few angry pans of it. I can understand those who think WFR is flawed and that Goodkind's writing is strange. I can even understand the claims that WTR borrowed themes and ideas from other fantasy writers. I caught myself thinking the same things about WFR. However, what I don't understand is the pathos of some of Goodkind's critics here. They seem darned angry about WFR's success for some reason.I suspect some of it has to do with Goodkind's arrogance. I must admit, judging from what Goodkind says in his interviews, he does come off as a pompous, self-important jerk. It's quite clear that Goodkind takes himself very seriously, and that he also seriously believes--as his book often points out--that people are stupid. Of course, all you have to do is look at the pictures of Goodkind to figure that out. The guy actually LOOKS like a jerk. But, I think that art should be judged separately from the artist, and so, I'm willing to overlook Goodkind's obvious egomania, although I am sympathetic to those who find it distasteful.The rest of the ire spewed in Goodkind's direction revolves around the character of his writing. The claim is frequently made, for instance, that WFR borrows heavily from other fantasy authors. However, I don't know of many fantasy authors who don't borrow heavily from the grand daddy of fantasy fiction, J.R. Tolkein. Without the Lord of the Rings, many of today's writers would be pretty hard up for material. The key though to using the ideas of other authors (and yes, all authors do this whether they claim to or not) is to take only the essence of the idea and somehow change it, filter it, mutate it until it becomes more a product of your own thinking than the originator's. So, when I happened upon a Gollum-like character midway through WFR, I worried that Goodkind was traipsing on thin ice. Then, of course, that character had an extremely minor role (about 20 pages and very little dialog) and seemed to me to be a very different kind of character than the one many of you will be aquainted with from LOTR. Apparently, there are other more egregious plagiarisms in WFR, but I'm willing to bet that the parallels seen by other critics are a bit exaggerated for the sake of justifying their dislike for Goodkind.Additionally, many critics dislike the sadism and overt sexuality of some of the passages in WFR. However, I believe these criticism are also exaggerated. At no point did I find the sexuality, rape, or torture present in WFR to be gratuitous. All of the depictions of violence and depravity in WFR had a purpose to the story. I think it's a good thing for authors to depict these kinds of depravity in an explicit and horrible light because they are indeed horrible things to behold or be the victim of. No one should be flippant about the psychic and physical impact of rape, murder, or torture. I believe that Goodkind's writing attempts to depict real suffering on the part of his characters and in doing so draws an enlarged empathy from his readers. Shying away from those subjects would remove a great deal of the emotional impact of the story.My own criticism of Goodkind is that his interpretation of love is dismally simplistic, and far too sexual in nature. Love is not limited to male/female partenships, yet again and again, the main character, Richard, is propelled by his love of Kahlan as by no other motivating force. I've seen this kind of drivel before in many forms and it always strikes me as (sadly) a very male interpretation of love. The idea always seems to be that the \"power of love\" and specifically, sexual love, will overcome all obstacles. History shows this to be an abysmally ill-conceived notion. In fact, the love demonstrated in WFR is of a fundamentally selfish and one-dimensional nature. That's very unfortunate since Goodkind built the entire story of WFR around this very kind of love.Additionally, to use the \"Power of Love\" to turn the sword of truth white--to kill with the \"Power of Love\"--strikes me as a desecration of love itself. I've heard of ideas like this before, but it's usually from boyfriends and husbands who beat their wives. \"I beat her because I love her so much,\" is the kind of rhetoric you'd hear from them. Goodkind takes pains toward the end of the book to show how love and brutality can become linked and that it's unhealthy, yet he falls into the trap of justifying brutality if it's done with the \"Power of Love.\" The \"Power of Love\" is a trite and dangerous idea, one I wish more authors would avoid, and I'm disappointed that Goodkind is so simplistic (and ignorant) in this regard.However, there are good points to WFR. Its pacing is great, and the plot twists are often jarring (in a good way). The story kept me on my toes and held my interest...no small feet after 800 pages. I also applaud Goodkind's attempt to inject emotion into his story, something other fantasy authors are often reluctant to do to the degree Goodkind has. It's refreshing to see fantasy subject matter depicted in this manner.But, in the end, I don't recommend this book. While the intent behind WFR is interesting and inspiring, its execution is poor...including the editing. I Guess You'll Either Love It or Hate It The first 40 chapters were great, so I bought the whole 9 book set... too bad the writer has a morbid fascination/imagination in chapters 40 plus... I would not recommend this book to anyone.. sorry nope While this book has all the basic fantasy elements, an old wizard, a hesitant hero and a strong love interest.. It makes the entire experience new with the amazing hero's and the characters that you can really root for and that are amazing to follow since they make mistakes and they are relatable. The story also has amazing philosophy that speaks to everyone about life and the value of each person. This is a MUST READ that simply cant be put down, and will have you racing for the next installment in the series. Captivating This book was my first experience with science fiction fantasy. I couldn't have made a better choice. Wizard's First Rule was spellbinding from the first page to the last. The characters were real and extremely likable. I look forward to reading each book in the series. Wizard's First Rule this was an incredibly great book. if u r into great fantasy books then u really need to try out this goodkind book. it will have everything tthat u could want in a book. a must buy A friend of mine pointed out to me that there was a new show called \"Legend of the Seeker\" based on books by Terry Goodkind. i instantly remebered reading Wizard's first rule and after watching a few of the episodes on TV and enjoying them i went to the library and brought Wizard's first rule home and started to engulf myself in it.......then i realized how much i hated this book. My 4 year old daughter has the same writing skills as Mr Goodkind does. the characters seemed to change on how they acted from page to page. The \"original\" story lines we outstanding. I mean when you think of the sword of truth nothing comes to mind like Terry Brooks.....i mean Goodkind, and lets not bring up all the little stuff he ripped of from Robert Jordan (yes his books got a little tiresome too but that was after book 5 or 6 not chapter one in book 1 ). I had to stop after ten chapters just to keep my sanity. if you want to read something fun and original try Brandan Sanderson's \"Mistborn\" series and his \"Elantris\" solo book. These books are fresh and fun with great writing. forgot all the bad parts This is the book that got me hooked reading fantasy novels. You will not be disappointed. This book is the first in a series called the sword of truth series. It has your basic fantasy elements (magic, wizards, evil people trying to bring the world into utter darkness, soldiers, beasts that can fly) and will keep you reading right to the end to see how the story finishes.To be honest the reason I love the book so much is because it has a compelling love story between the main character Richard Cypher and a woman he meets named Kahlan. The world that Terry Goodkind creates is very descriptive and the characters believable. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fantasy lover. Also if you like this book you'll definitely like \"A Game of Thrones\" by George R.R. Martin. One of the Best Fantasy Books Out There The most striking piece of Terry Goodkind's _Wizard's_ First_ Rule_ was the re-creation in prose of a Sam Peckinpaugh-esque cinematic device: the slow-motion death of a villain, described in vivid detail as the his head erupts in a spray of gore, courtesy of the protagonist's sword. It captured a phenomenon I have experienced in real life, temporal distortion. While some will find that sort of imagery offensive, the scene had me &quot;inside the story.&quot; The same was true of some scenes near &quot;the Boundary,&quot; an interesting device that is well thought out.Sadly, these gems are exceptions that highlight a long winded tale. The story lacks timing and punch, although I admire the sustained effort to capture the sarcastic banter common among team members sharing a difficult task. Magic is far too commonplace to allow any sense of connection to &quot;reality&quot; -- the suspension of deibelief required is too great. Contrast with Jordan's first WoT book, where the wonder of &quot;magic&quot; shows how rare it is, and how it intimidates normal mortals.In general, the characterizations aren't deep enough, and the contrived emotional tension between Richard and Kahlan is overdone. The vignette covering the abuse/brainwash/mutilation of a preadolescent boy seemed out of place in this story, a mere &quot;proof&quot; that the villain is thoroughly evil. We didn't need gratuitous child brutality to figure that out.Insofar as providing a setting/world/background, this book falls woefully short of many other works. Descriptions were eratic, and did not paint a very complete picture of the setting.Do I have the patience for the next three books of this series, hoping the style will tighten up? The size of the paper backs does not bode well for that outcome. I give Goodkind credit for energy and productivity, however page count does not equate to greatness. It is the quality of the paragraphs that make for enjoyable reading, not the quantity.For those entusiastic readers who gush about Goodkind being the next Tolkein, or on the same level as Martin or Jordan, you obviously have not read enough different styles or genres. Try some regular fiction, some non-fiction, some short stories. Read the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, at the very least. You will see that a tight prose style is a key ingredient to successful story telling. Not a classic, but it has some interesting moments When reading high fantasy, I rarely have high hopes as to originality of plot, and there were no surprises here. I do generally expect more writing skill and better dialogue than Mr. Goodking bothered to provide. The dialogue seemed forced on almost every occasion; the writing seemed to be that of a sophomore in high school. If it weren't for the low standards I hold the genre to, I would have rated this book as a 1. A \"Meh\" worthy book Being a long time magic lover, I fell in love with the story after reading the first page. It was mesmerizing, filled with excitement, humor, wisdom and human frailty. It was easy to read and provided hours and hours of total entertainment. I highly recommend this to anyone who misses Harry Potter. The Wizards Rule! I have read fantasy since I was seven years old (starting with C.S. Lewis and Tolkien), and this book was on the 2nd grade reading level. The authors writing style was simplistic and redundant, and 90 percent of the images in the book were hackneyed and trite. The Bone Woman and multiflavored Gars were the worst. The only original part of the book concerned the Mord-Sith and the still somewhat cheesy training by pain. If you want a serious good book do not look here. CLICHE AND CHILDISH I have never been an avid reader of fantasy novels, yet Goodkind has spellbounded me with his wondorous writing style and magnificent characters. You begin your read with such appreciation for the pace and direction of the story, that putting it down is almost painful. His characters are strong, intelligent yet not above pain and suffering. They are each representative of who we are in so many ways, and who we fantasize to be in our minds. The story itself never stops moving, not for a second. I loved that best of all! Terry does not write this book as a screenplay for Hollywood (as so many authors I find do today) he writes this as a true storyteller. I cannot say enough positive things about this book. Treat yourself by engulfing your mind into a fantastic story of love, hate, strength, weakness, and best of all magic! Enchantingly absorbing...... an absolute &quot;Must Read&quot; I hesitated when giving this book a 4 star rating because my impulse was to give it 5. After some thought I decided to give it 4 stars instead when compared to 'Lord of the Rings' books for example which are masterpieces. I first became aware of the book through a friend that shared my love of reading. I was blown away by the vast complex world and I was hooked. I have since read the entire 'Sword of Truth' series as well as all of Goodkind's books.The story centers around Richard Cypher, a woods guide, who becomes our eyes and ears in this magical world. He is as mesmerized as we are by the strange landscape and inhabitants. He travels through this new world after the death of his father with a young woman he saved from four men which makes the beginning of his perilous journey. This wonderful tale is written with excellent descriptive and detailed language. The character development is intricate and satisfying for a reader. You manage to get invested quickly and end up scratching your head after going through eight hundred twenty pages as fast as you did.Beware of the violence: torture is the favorite pastime of the evil. If you have a weak stomach, this may not be your book.In conclusion, if you are looking for a good story with great characters, and wizards, and dragons, and magic, then this is your cup of tea. The overall story has clich&eacute;d elements but the heart of the story is interesting and refreshing. I read this book/series at least once every couple of years. It makes me happy. :) Solid Fantasy! Nice little door stopper/paper weight/S&amp;M novel form the writer who apperently thinks that if a book has enouth words in it it will somehow reach criticall mass and become good blah blah blah I thought this was a good book. It's easy to read, has easy to like characters and the plot is not to difficult to discern. Read it for yourself, develop your own opinion, and you may find that you like the book better than you thought you would. Better than you think The good:The first 300 pages. Careful and sensitive location and environment descriptions, primarily in the woodland areas. It's worth also mentioning the spine-chilling chapter where Richard & Kahlan are in the middle of the boundary crossing, which is written brilliantly - It'll make your hair stand on end! At this point I thought I was in for a cracking read.The bad:Almost the whole of the rest of the book, starting with the mind-numbing stay with the mud-people. The uninteresting sections of this book go on for just far too long. The last 100 pages descend into soap-operatic farce, with almost any improbable scenario being made up in a rush to get to the excedingly disappointing climax.The Unnecessarily perverse:I do not want to read 75 repetitive pages detailing torture and horrendous cruelty if it does little in terms of developing the plot. I do not want to read descriptions of children being raped, molested and killed, even if it does help develop the plot. I understand the need for mature content, but this type of subject matter pops up far too often to make reading this book an enjoyable experience for any decent person.I was ready to love this book after I read some great sequences near the beginning - to be fair there are some original ideas, and Goodkind's writing style has a soft sensitive warmth at times that I haven't come across elsewhere. However, ultimately as time wore on it wasn't enough to stop my mind wandering, and when the end arrived I found myself breathing an apathetic sigh of relief. The Good, the Bad, and the Unnecessarily perverse Is that abomination of an editorial review supposed to be helpful? I'm left wondering if the editorial reviewer actually read the book!Wizard's First Rule is one of the most unique and intriguing books you'll ever read. The characters are a fascinating representation of the true human condition; their interactions, relationships, challenges and journey will draw you in, deeper and deeper, until you've completed the entire series and are left hungry for more.Human issues, romance, murder/mystery, war, religion, thriller, fantasy, philosophy. This book has everything and more.CMCEverett, WA This is the beginning of the most amazing story arc you'll ever read, period. &lt;=== Wizards First Rule begins to take you on an adventure that will challenge you. Once the book is picked up you can become totally engulfed in what is going on. You see the challenges that Richard, Kahlan and Zedd will face and end up cheering them on as the story progresses. Which will win? What will the outcome be? Richard and Kahlan are characters that are believable. You can get lost in the book. It was a rewarding read. I loved taking the lessons that were learned in the book by Richard and Kahlan and seeing how they ended and how the characters changed through the series. I know I learned a lot of life lessons from the series and look at things differently. I am a better person because of it. Wizards first rule and the series reminds you of the important things in life that we often forget to remember or take the time to do. I learn something new every time I read the book. Thank you. \"Your life is yours alone, rise up and live it\" Wizard's First Rule is only the beginning to the most hauntingly beautiful and enthralling story I have, and will ever have read. It lays predcessor to five other books that match and consecutively and increasingly improve upon what I first percieved as pure literary genius. After reading all six books, Sword of Truth has made all other books I have read in the past and ever book I have picked up since seem pale and dull in comparison. Read these books. Epic Fantasy of Unmatched Beauty and Writing Skill I picked this book up on the recomendation of a book seller and I was desperate for something new to read.The first time I tried to read it, I didn't get through the first chapter. I should have taken it back and demanded my money back. But I tried it again years later. I can read 2 or 3 books a day, but it took me 2 weeks to slog through this drivel.It's so forgettable that I remember now is that it had a hero... no worthwhile female characters and someone that liked to torture along with sex so that they would become intertwined. Gee thats really uplifting. I have seldom read a book I have despised more. totally forgettable except for the gratuitous torture Imagine if Christopher Paolini had decided to write Wheel of Time fanfiction. That's what this is. Oh, and it gets served up with a side of Ayn Rand (excuse me while I vomit).Is it bad? Well, kinda; I really would place it about on the same level as Eragon in terms of originality (none) and writing style (juvenile). However, I put it lower for two reasons: Paolini actually WAS just a kid (granted, a kid with publisher parents) whereas Goodkind was not; and Wizard's First Rule spends a great deal of space on some rather unpleasant topics (murder, rape, torture [much of which has sadomasochistic overtones]) which would be difficult to handle even in the hands of a more gifted author. With Goodkind it's just miserable.The characters are cutouts, Richard in particular. I would say that all of them, again especially Richard, get worse as the series wears on (starting off here as bumbling dupes and eventually turning into sociopathic dictators to serve as the author's mouthpiece) but I'll try to restrain myself to just this book. The world is rather flat and unrealistic, with nothing that really pops out. Unlike, say, Jordan. They both use lots of words, but Jordan turns his words into worlds. Goodkind just lets them stay words. The fantasy elements don't really work, but then Goodkind has said that it isn't really fantasy; he's somewhat ashamed to be considered such.I've been told that this is actually the best of the series; I only made it through the first three before deciding I really could find better things to do with my time. Would I recommend it? Eh, if you want something that's not too taxing and you don't expect much from it, I guess this one (AND ONLY THIS ONE) is okay. Otherwise, just skip it. If you need to kill a weekend Don't waste your time on Terry Goodkind. He doesn't have an original story element in any of his books. I have read his first several books in the hope of finding something interesting. Unfortunately, he apparently can't come up with his own ideas. If you have read much fantasy, you will recognize ideas he has lifted from Tolkien, Jordan and a number of other authors with actual talent. In some cases it is so blatant that I wonder the other authors don't sue for copyright infringement. Don't waste your time or money on these books. Read the originals. What a hack. I read this book on a recomendation of a friend. It took a bit of effort to get started. It started out a Luke Sywalker Character then he meek Ben Zoolander Kanobi and Princes Leigha. Out of the blue Richard Sywalker saves some random girl that comes wandering by his home. He has some megomanic brother that has gives this speech against fire. Richard Skywalker finds out that Drunken Darth Rahl is planning to take over the world and he gets the light saber of truth. I would even venture to say that there is the Han and Chewy characters.I would have given the book four stars up to 3/4 of the book. The main characters can't comunicate and hold a great deal of secrets from \"best friends\". It is very plausable that Darth Rahl would have been stopped if the whole group stayed home and not bothered. There is some quest for the last box to complete the total control of the universe. The box is secured from Darth Rahl and the good guys get their hands on it and get it back to Rahl.There are so many missed opertunites and walking into traps. I didn't mind the sex and violence and creepy characters. That was the best part of the book because the rest of it was so lame. They seem to have it won then they screw it up or by the way there is a spell you have to go back.The philosophy and set up for the story was really good despite the overly good characters. The quest was fun trying to figure where the box was. They have it in their hands and just when things are settled by the way something really messed up happens. That happens four or five times. Finally Richard Skywalker ends up in a confrontation with Darth Rahl and uses a lame trick to save the day. Good start but tedius I read this book awhile ago and a friend recently asked to borrow it from me. I gave it to her. I got through the first book barely and a couple chapters into the secound book I just gave up. This book was so predictable, and not in the \"wow I want this to happen\" way. The main characters were way overdone and not at all interesting. I just couldn't find anything I enjoyed about the book when it was done. too predictable I had a hard time getting into this. It took me awhile to get everyone straight and to figure out what was going on. Once I did, I enjoyed it very much. The rough start could have been helped if I had read the prequel BEFORE I read this one. But alas, I failed to do that and didn't pick up the prequel until I had closed the curtain on book #1. There is a formula that books in this genre follow, this one was no different, but I enjoyed the journey to the same old story/plot/ending. I will try book two of this series as well. Don't Forget the Prequel Advice to Goodkind: If you *must* imitate someone, it's best to imitate someone better than merely adequate. But this isn't a Wheel of Time review. No, it's about the tawdry little thing called Wizard's First Rule. The predictable Gandalf-clone mentors the predictable Rand-clone into the Full Use of His Awesome Powers (tm). There are a few (woefully rare) excellent stylistic moments, but the plot is strictly by-the-numbers and the characterization is down there with Larry Niven. I finished it, but it was a pretty boring slog through the last third, after I realized Goodkind wasn't going to really work with the relationship of overwhelming rage to good/evil at all, which was the one interesting core idea in the book. Still, Piers Anthony sells books, so I suppose *somebody* finds this worthwhile, and who am I to spit on their little pleasures? By all means, read W1stR, and get the rest of 'em if it appeals to you. It keeps Goodkind off the public dole, and I suppose someone would have processed that wood into pulp anyhow. Does Jordan know Goodkind's biting his gig? I love the Sword of Truth series - I've been reading it for years and with two novels left to read, am very excited to reach the end. Goodkind's main abililty is creation of characters that you truly care about; they grow and change as the series goes on, they have real motivations and reasons for the things they do, and they have flaws which make them human (or whatever race they happen to be). New characters move in and out of the series, creating a large network that gives a sense of a real world. His themes range from the more traditional fantasy, like love and power, to the very contemporary, like rape and child molestation. This merging of the two worlds is perhaps Goodkind's greatest achievement.That being said, like any author, Goodkind has his flaws. He does have some very hackneyed plot points, most evident in this, his first novel. He grows as a writer, however, as the series continues and starts to move away from overused ideas to some truly original creations. Goodkind is no Robert Jordan, though, and lacks in seriously intricate plot weavings and political manuervering. But by the same token, you won't need a glossary just to have a clue what's going on. His main weakness is with language, where he stuggles with more adult sentence creation and word choice. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; it does make the series very accessible. And although Goodkind has a way with people, he lacks in his creation of a robust landscape. This is very evident in his map, which is by no means a Tolkienesque feat. The world is really just a large area cut into three pieces.Overall, if you're willing to commit to a series of 12 books (most end on a cliff-hanger so you'll probably be stuck in the series before you know it) the Sword of Truth series is a worthly addition to almost any fantasy lovers bookshelf. A Great Author - Even With His Flaws There are a lot of self published books that are far better written than this thing. Very slow going, the hero is presented as some sort of imbecile, the characters aren't engaging. Don't waste your time. boring, slow going, poor writing style Wizard's First Rule was full of fast paced battles, inticate puzzles,an exciting plot line,and agreeable characters which blinded me from ever noticing the book's size. Richard,the main character,starts off as a normal woods giude when a conffesor crosses the boundary and changes his life,this starts thier heart pounding journey to save everyone from the merciless rule of Darken Rhal. This book contains all the great elements action,romance,drama,and even some comic relief. Terry Goodkind has woven a wonderful story that surpassess the writing of many of the great fantasy authors I have read.This is how Jordan should have written Wheel of Time series. Wizard's First Rule is for everyone to enjoy. FANTASTIC BOOK TO START GREAT SERIES The first book is a tediously slow start to what ultimately becomes a very engrossing and detailed epic. Why then are there many low and mediocre reviews? There is an underlying ideological theme that develops as the series unfolds. The first book takes a long time to develop due to the intricate plot and scope of the full series. Anyone who sees the book as simple, trite, hackneyed, etc. simply does not posses the intellect to comprehend so many contiguous and interwoven storylines, plots and characters. You either get it, or you don't. The underlying \"political\" ideology regarding the evil of a government that dictates \"what's best for the common good of the people\", will bring cheers from those more conservative minded readers, and jeers from more liberal readers. The full series gets 5 stars, this book is a weak start to a great epic. Book review on Wizard's First RuleA trail guide, Richard, finds a lady, Kahlan, in the wood that is being pursued; he later finds out that she is of a high status. The lady tells him that the barrier dividing her region from his is failing and will soon be gone. Shortly afterwards he is appointed a Seeker of Truth by his old friend, Zed, who turned out to be a wizard. He goes out to avenge the death of his father, who was killed by Darken Rahl. In his quest for truth he was finally able to prevail against Darken Rahl.The book Wizard's First Rule was influential because it showed how righteous anger can be a good thing if you know how to use it since it allows you to finish your goal. Anger also has a negative side that can make you do things that you regret later. The book also shows that the truth is not what always what you want to hear. Another influential part is the wizards first rule \"People are stupid, given proper motivation; almost anyone will believe almost anything.\" The book Wizard's First Rule was very influential to me.The book tells me that all people have a temper just some people can hold it better that others and since all people are stupid. It also shows that some people side with the power hungry people who have a larger probability to win because of their unethical methods. The power hungry people will eventually be overthrown by the rest of the public who dislike the person. It also shows that in the short time that those people are in power they can do irreversible damage. The book revealed some things about people that I hadn't known previously.The author style was narration with short paragraphs and chapters. The author also used many adjectives to give a vivid image in your of the setting. He gives all his characters unique personalities and makes sure you don't forget them. Review on Wizard's First rule Wizard's First Rule is a very enjoyable read. I was recommended this series by a work mate who also put me onto Game of Thrones. Reading this book straight after finishing all the Game of Thrones books is probably not a good idea. They are two totally different reading experiences. I have to admit although I love the story in Wizard's First Rule, and all the information about magic, I found the dialogue a bit wooden and not very sophisticated. The thing which irked me the most was the character of Rachael the little girl talking about \"having to go potty\". I know she's only a little child but really...it just grated on me...Also, Samuel seemed very much like Gollum from Lord of the Rings and the Mord-SITH??? Star Wars anyone??? But, in spite of all of this I recognise it's a totally different book, series of books, and a totally different writer to Game of Thrones. Having said that, after I finished each GOT book I was desperate to start the next one, whereas with this one, well I have bought the second book in the series, because I do want to follow Richard and Kahlan on their journeys, but I am not desperate to begin just yet...So, all in all I enjoyed it very much, and in spite of referencing other fantasy/sci fi stories it's a very original story. I am glad I read it and I will pick it up again in the near future. Hard act to follow after Game of Thrones &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; shows the brilliant and creative imagination of Mr. Goodkind. I found myself unable to place the book down. His intriguing and descriptive usage of words, pull you in from the first to the last page.This book displays a mixture of fantasy, mystery, and suspense. Towards the end of this book, you think you have finally solved the puzzle, when out of no where, Goodkind adds another detail and the puzzle--you realize--is now missing pieces. Once again, you must put your mind to the test and rearrange the characters, conditions, and settings. At times, it is very contradicting!Throughout the story, Kahlan Amnell, Richard Cypher(Rahl)--a once quiet and modest woodsman, and Zedd--the last of great wizards--stand together to battle evil and protect the innocent throughout the lands of Westland, the Midlands, and D'Hara. During their journey's, Richard discovers many dark secrets about his past and is named the Seeker.The Seeker carries the Sword of Truth--now you understand where the series' title comes from--and searches in the name of truth. Richard travels to D'Hara and the People's Palace primarily to stop Darken Rahl and to destroy the boxes of Orden. During the course of the tale, things turn out as hoped, but other things fail. At the end of the book, you want to run to the library and pick up the sequel in order to find out what happens.I recommend all of the books in the Sword of Truth Series! Amazingly, the sequels are always getting better and better!Though some argue that Mr. Goodkind's books tend to be on the graphic side, I tend to think that because they are graphic, it means Mr. Goodkind has been able to place words in such a way, we are able to picture what he is writing. Only talented writers such J.R.R. Tolkien and Terry Goodkind are able to make the words flow with such intensity. Tolkien has Competition After having read this book for the third time, I'm still not entirely sure what I think about it. There are parts of it I like, there are parts of it that I hate and in this book they are more or less evenly mixed. While I feel that there are some glaring issues in this book that detract from the overall story, it's not as bad as the books that come later in the series. It is a little bit difficult to forget what is coming and that does give me a slightly more unfavorable than I would otherwise.The story in this book is really pretty interesting. There are some unique characters and adventures that take place that drag you deeper into the story but there are also some things that I feel were borrowed from other fantasy series. This makes me lose a little respect for the author but it's pretty popular in fantasy series these days so it's not that major. The story is intriguing and keeps the book moving forward but sometimes I had issues with the pacing. It was like jumping from major event to major event without much down time between. I prefer to really get into the story rather than just jumping into danger after danger after danger. That's probably more personal preference than anything else.One of the other things I really didn't like about this book (or this series) is some of the characters' inconsistencies. I don't need perfect realism in my characters but I should be able to relate and believe them. Their emotions and actions should make sense given what I've been told about them. I don't feel like this is a case a lot of the time. One character that this really irritates me with is Kahlan. In several scenes, she is almost on the point of killing someone only to be crying on their shoulder or cuddling with them the next. It doesn't make sense and is unrealistic. It's highly unlikely that she would have revealed as many of her secrets as she did to Richard on their first day of meeting, much less spent the night cuddled up with him. Nor is it realistic that as soon as Richard sees her (from a vast distance, no less) that he's already head over heels in love with her. There is nothing wrong with love in books, it's a natural human emotion. But love doesn't develop instantaneously as it seems to have this pair. Nor are many people as inconstant in their emotions as a lot of his characters seem to be. Kahlan can either be a strong character or be a weak, typical woman. It's demeaning to her as a character to make her both simply to advance the love story along or make her more relatable.But that isn't the only issue that really bothers me with this book, there's more. I dislike the way Richard is sometimes. At some points, he's a wonderful, respectful young man who is always eager to help and avoid fights. Other points, he is completely intolerant of other people and their cultures. He is even described that way when they are with the Mud People (really original name there). If the story is going to have one clear, cut hero the reader really should like him. And at this point, I don't.Additionally, there are several points in this books where the author clearly trumpets his views using a thin veneer of story. If you think Socialism is evil, that's fine but I don't want to read about it in your fiction. Write a nonfiction about it and be done with it. I don't want conscious allegory; I don't want to feel like I'm reading a scene written only to reveal the evil of a worldview; I want to read a fantasy novel that may make me think about those things. But please, don't insult the reader's intelligence. Most of us don't need taken by the hand and led to your beliefs. I'll get it whether or not you clearly spell it out and have a lot more respect for you as a writer for it.All in all, the story is pretty decent but it is constantly let down by its writer. From what I remember of the series, it only gets worse at it goes on but we'll see as I give this series on last chance. If you're looking for an exciting, intelligent fantasy series, I'd highly suggest A Song of Ice and Fire or The Wheel of Time. Both of them provide a better, more immersive reading experience without leaving a lot to be desired. There are far better fantasy series available I find it hard to believe that some folks are giving this book 4 (or FIVE???) stars. This book is awful.First the good. From the first page, to the last, there were 2 decent memorable scenes. During those scenes, I had to force my imagination to fill in some detail, and ignore the dreadful prose.One scene was the creature with the flies on it.The second scene was our heroes navigating through the \"secret\" break in the impenetrable force field. (Oh, there MUST be a break in the impenetrable force field you see, because our hero MUST get through... SOMEHOW!)As a general statement regarding the good parts, they only rate \"good\" because they were interesting IDEAS presented with the ever present junior high school writing style.That's it for the good.Now for the bad. The main character, Richard (bleh) is about as sappy, and cliche as possible. The female that he's going to cliche fall in love with (you'll know it's part of the cliche plot it's so bad) is as cliche and syrupy as possible. I can't even remember her sappy cliche name. Probably \"Mary\" or something equally uncreative.The cardboard characters move around the cardboard world with all the excitement and stilted emotion of paper doll cutouts. The concept of \"character development\" is taken to the extreme lower depths of creativity as our hero Richard repeatedly \"runs his fingers through his hair\" until I was ready to scream at him to stop the idiotic behavior. (Ohhhh, the use of \"behavioral quirks\" though! Yes! It's necessary so the hero's friends could identify him later by this annoying behavioral quirk.)Character development is the worst I've ever read.The dialogue is horrendously bad, and holds the dubious distinction of being the WORST I've ever read.The ridiculous plot is so bad it's almost the worst I've ever read (The House of Doors holding the bottom spot). The entire story is replete with the author withholding information that the characters (especially the female sidekick) would have, could have, and SHOULD have told our hero under \"normal\" circumstances. But to do so would cause the story to fall apart. Instead of rethinking and editing the story for a smoother plotline, the author forges ahead and forces the female sidekick to cliche \"bite her knuckles\" and offer various clich&eacute; ways of:Mary gnawed on her knuckle and sniffled \"I... I just can't tell you Richard.\"::shrieks::God it's bad. It's cliche hell.And then we come to the end of the story where our cardboard hero finds himself mercilessly tortured by sadists with maximum magical torture devices. And, naturally he falls in love with his tormentor. (Oh, he'll do ANYTHING for her love!)About this time, I began to puke onto my copy of this book.Apparently, the author had come across information regarding hostages occasionally falling in love with their kidnappers, and stupidly applied that psychological abnormality to someone who's being TORTURED. His lack of research on THAT subject leads to the idiotic ending.The final revelation as to the nature of the Sword of Truth and it's purpose, and the nature of the female sidekick, reveals even MORE clich&eacute;s, as if we had an insatiable appetite for them.Apparently, the author had a warehouse full of clich&eacute;s and decided to package them up in this story to get the inventory down.I had to force myself to finish this horrendously bad book.If you're looking for a few ideas for use in a gaming world, you'll find a couple interesting ideas that could be further developed, but if you are looking for a decent story, this isn't worth your time, let alone your hard earned money.This book sucks in all ways, from all angles, from start to finish, and I was personally furious that Mariam Zimmer Bradley gave a review (that encouraged me to purchase this piece of crap) that said \"I honestly believe this will take the world like J. R. Tolkein\" or something to that effect.Yeah, right.Believe ME... this story, and the writing, is terrible.- Alleyrat A few interesting scenes, otherwise lousy This is the first book of a series. I've never cared for Fantasy before, but I was hooked from page one. Goodkind is a master storyteller. The plot and characters are highly imaginative and lots of fun, a real page-turner, hard to put down. I highly recommend this story to those who enjoy both high adventure and deeper thoughts. An Excellent Story Well, my boyfriend got me reading this series, and it was amazing that he was able to, seeing as though I have never liked fantasy. But, I gave it a try, mostly just to humor him, and I was shocked: I actually enjoyed it! Even though it's well over 800 pages and is very slow in some parts (hence the 4 stars, not 5), the overall story more than makes up for it. The love story between Richard the Seeker and Kahlan the Mother Confessor is a beautiful one. And the main villain plot was interesting, though I think it could have been more climactic. I highly recommend that anyone (excluding maybe younger readers) read this series, even if they're not into fantasy. Hey, I wasn't, but I am now. Seriously, you will not be disappointed. Fantastic! Wizard's First Rule (by Terry Goodkind) is absolutely one of the best books I've read in a long time!! I purchased the book in audio version because I have a very long commute. The book kept me well entertained and my mind off the traffic. The world that Goodkind creates is rich and creative. The narrator's (Sam Tsoutsouvas) voice is deep and seems to fit the story well. His voice is soothing, but not boring -- it's puts me in the mind of my Grandfather. I'll continue onto the next books and I can't wait!!FYI: I wish they would have kept the same narrator for the other versions -- but they didn't :( A very short review of the audio version....BUY IT! I'm giving this book four stars because I ENJOYED it, even though the enjoyment is a sort of pleasure I'm not proud of. Most of the criticisms in the negative reviews are true. This certainly isn't The Lord of the Rings. I can't say that it's any worse then Robert Jordan. Although one should note that Goodkind seems to have copied a lot of Jordan's ideas, one should also note that Jordan copied stuff from fantasy genre books before him. So who can say that this is less original than Jodan? At least Goodkind seems to have finished his series. I gave up on Jordan after book 6 or 7 (forget which) when it seemed like he had no intention of ever finishing the series; and I was right, Jordan died before he finished the series.I liked the sado-masochism stuff. Kind of. Do all fantasy writers secretly want to be dominated by women?The writing is very simplistic and I often feel like Goodkind is talking down to me as if I'm a 12-year-old child. It feels like Goodkind has tried to repackage Atlas Shrugged for precocious middle school students.One should also ignore the author's ramblings in which he gets upset that the world considers his book derivative fantasy genre instead of Great Literature. In this case, the world is right and the author is wrong. The author should just be happy that he's making a lot of money while entertaining a lot of readers.But in the end, Goodkind has created a book where you want to keep turning the pages in order to find out what happens. I can't ask for more from escapist fiction. Enjoy it for what it is instead of complaining about what it's not. I'm currently most of the way through the second book, which is better than this one. Fun escapist fiction This is a book of good taste and brilliant wording. I love this book so much that I started telling people that my book was eating me due to the fact that it is so good i dont want to put it down. I find myself alternating between the book and reality as if the book was a reality of its own. This is a book of great poportions and should be read by all. Wizards First Rule MY FAVORITE book EVER... At first my favorite book was in the eyes of a dragon by steven king...then someone let me borrow this one and I must say it is the BEST fantasy book ever. If you like fantasy this is a MUST READ. It just amazes me where he gets his imagination from. I have read the whole series and can not wait for the next book to come out. Reader You know what, guys? Some of you just take literature far too seriously. I mean, it's just a book for God's sake! Sheesh! The following is a review of the book as well as a review of the reviewers.First, the book. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I'm a big fantasy fan, and I thought this was a worth entry into the genre. Sure, some of the scenes were a little silly. Some were gory. Some were intense. And some were really graphic. But a book this big and involving was never meant to be read by twelve-year-olds. You're an adult, you should be able to handle it. If you can't, no one's forcing you to continue. Take the book back to the library, sell it at a used book store. Whatever.Anyway, I liked it. The writing is such that the reader really begins to feel for the characters. I still get the shivers whenever I read about Richard's capture and subsequent torture. And the reader really cheers when Kahlan snaps and kills the bad guys with her magic. Like I said, a worthy entry into the genre.Now, the review of the reviewers. What the hell is up with you guys? Mostly, the folks that enjoyed the book are very good-natured. They liked the book, and they basically just wanted to say their piece and leave. The biggest complaint from the book-haters has been the bad grammar in the reviews. Well folks, nobody's perfect, all right? One review by A Reader (didn't want to leave your name, huh?) said that everybody's grammar was terrible. Well, pal, you know what? When you're using the possessive, the word YOU'RE is spelled just like that, not YOUR. And English is capitalized, too.My whole point is that you should all lighten up. If you liked the book, that's great, but if you didn't, don't call us morons. Just say &quot;I didn't like the book. End of story.&quot; Learn to handle your stress in healthier ways. Wow Wizard's First Rule is a remarkable book. It's probably the only book in the series that should've been written (Faith of the Fallen is a possible exception, although with it begins Goodkind's fall into explicit, philosophical moralizing). I love Richard and Kahlan. As archetypal heroes they are perhaps the most numinous I've encountered in high fantasy. I just wish they'd been treated more respectfully. The tortures they've been made to endure have been difficult for me to bear (not only narratively, but also literarily [Wizard's First Rule aside]). I would rather he had written a trilogy than a... meandering hendecalogy.In all, the series reminds of many I've seen on T.V. Shows like: Alias, Lost, Heroes. Each had great first seasons, but from there descended agonizingly into Soap Opera. It is appropriate, then, that the final insult has been delivered to the Sword of Truth Series and there is now a Legend of the Seeker T.V. show. Apparently Goodkind was excited about this (judging by the press blurbs on his website), but I wonder if he still is. I watched the first two episodes on Hulu and find it difficult to believe that such a great vision could be so handily slaughtered (it's as if they were handled by an anti-seeker, a master of destroying noble visions). But then, I've seen the many attempts at Dune, so I don't know why I was surprised. I get the sense, from the books, that Richard is in or nearly in his 30's. That before meeting Kahlan he was already a mature, quiet man, whose slightly older brother was the political leader of the region. In the series, however, he is cast as a muscle-bound 21 year old with a disproportionately small, immature face. In the book Zedd had been teaching Richard, covertly, his entire life. In the Show, Zedd was just a \"crazy old man that talks to chickens\". Kahlan is played by an actress without facial musculature necessary to express true depth of emotion or judgement. (I only speak of the T.V. Show to give a second example of the sort of betrayal the original vision has endured.)I like the philosophy that Goodkind presents... within reason :) Having read Ayn Rand long before I picked up his books, I recognized immediately the sense of life he was portraying. But he falls into many of the same errors as she did. Not the least of which is shallow, unbelievable depictions of the \"other side\". I admit, the anti-life philosophy can be comical when stripped of its dressings and custumes. It can also be depressing to realize how many people really \"live by\", in essence, the abdication of the Self. But I don't think the sanctity of life is truly expressed by simplifying beyond recognition the complexities of the ways we fall into error and the difficulties we face in prising right from wrong. One dimensional representations of man cannot provide the necessary contrast for a true appreciation of the great achievement that is a truly moral life.In summary, the trajectory of this series of books is as follows: what started as an archetypal human struggle against darkness has ended in the sado-masochistic catharsis of an author. Does Goodkind enjoy torturing the soul-personified with his agiel-pen? I don't know, but many times I've had to put my inner hero in'an inner box to protect him from this series' relentless cruelty.-Jerome Meyers Epic beginning This book kept me up all hours of the night! It was put togeather so well that I read it twice befor I moved on to the second one. I have never seen a book with char. develpoment as good as this. I reccomend this book to every one, once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down. This book gets more then 5 stars i give it 10!!!! Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1) This is the best fantasy book that I have read to date. I used to read the Shannara books and think that they were the greatest (still the second best fantasy series), but Goodkind's world is entrapping. The way that Goodkind brings the characters to life is remarkable, and the plot keeps you turning the pages. If you've read Harry Potter and liked it, then you'll love this book. It's rich fabric is extremly more involving and it's characters are more real. The best start to a fantasy series that I have read so far. Great Fantasy I loved, loved, loved this book. It is classic fantasy full of magic swords, magic animals and magic characters. The story is complex but not confusing. I couldn't put it down. I'm kicking myself for not reading this when it came out in the 90's - but as with all good books, age has not diminished it. Why didn't I read this years ago? Wizard's First Rule is a classsic good versus evil morality story. In true sci-fi form, a &quot;good&quot; person is enlisted in the service of overthrowing an evil emperor. In this case, Richard (the good guy) does not have any clue about things magical (or even the existence of magic). Nonetheless, he is forced to face his destiny with the help of colorful people who are so well developed you cannot help but feel that they are your friends too. Likewise, the evil forces are well drawn out, and make you detest them and fear for our hero. You will enjoy this book, as well as the sequels. terrific story told in classic sci-fi style Be warned, this book has a lot of thoroughly described violence in it. If you enjoy the current crop of shock films, this won't be a problem. More conservative readers will find the book gratuitous.Goodkind borrows a handful of cliches and binds them together into a linear plot line. The story begins with a problem, and works towards the improbable solution. There is a requisite allusion to the sequel. Like Star Wars, the book is hardly thought provoking, but entertaining. Given his motivations, Goodkind would certainly disagree.Goodkind introduces a number of Skeptic, Athiest, and Objectivist philosophical themes throughout his series that will appeal to some and offend others. If you're \"on the fence\" with your religion and you like fantasy, it's worth reading just to introduce further topics for research. 20-something males positively love this stuff. On his web site, Goodkind clearly states that his first objective as a writer isn't to entertain, but to pass on his message in an easily digestible medium. Consider his work the modern equivalent of morality plays, and you'll find things to appreciate.The mediocre writing would be quite acceptable if Terry didn't arrogantly state on his web site that \"writers are born, not made\" and that he eschews the publishing industry's methods for acquiring, vetting, and editing work. I found it cheapened the books' message, especially considering the modesty of the main characters. His press releases and responses to fan questions are a real turn off. Read the books before getting to know the author. Light, \"R\" rated reading I am a fairly new reader, of only six months, in that time I have plunged into every fantasy book I can get my hands on and by far this book has brought me into like none other. I have read all the complaints about \"Wizard's First rule\" about using magic to escape, to win fights at the last second,and being too unrealistic, yada, yada, yada. Well i dont read books to read about how real it is, if i wanted to do that i would just buy a history book and not a fantasy. The book is truly great, with a fantastic story and great characters. I felt for all the characters, even when it did not involve richard (who is one of my favorite's I've ever read about), they all seemed to have a purpose and a great personality to them. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. If you truly love to go to another world I'm very happy to see Wizard's First Rule available for Kindle. This book is a real favorite of mine. The characters of Richard and Kahlan immediately caught my interest, and I followed their adventures through the 11 book Sword of Truth series.Many contemporary authors tell stories that reflect an ambiguous take on evil. While they can be entertaining, I found it refreshing to see the heroes distinguish between good and evil, delving into what each consists of.But more importantly, I had a lot of fun just taking in the story. For me, Goodkind's first novel more than makes up for a few awkward turns of phrase with its colorful characters, and page-turning plot. This is good old-fashioned edge of your seat storytelling tackled with enthusiasm and energy.I expect that Kindle and Goodkind will gain more fans from this arrangement. An old favorite meets a new medium As millions have already found out, The Sword of Truth Series is not just a book series, but rather a creative world outside our own. I've read many classics in my lifetime and never have I been so fortunate to come across something so creative, imaginative, spell binding and emotional. I came upon this series purely by fate. For the longest time when I was younger, my sister tried to get me to read this book. I refused because I preferred more \"realistic\" literature. Finally, after considerable persistence by my sister I gave in reluctantly to appease her. Of course, the conditions were set by her.. \" Let me read you the first two chapters and if you don't like it..then I'll stop\"... Thinking this was a quick way out, I accepted. She started reading. It wasn't long before she just suddenly stopped. Confused, I asked her why she was stopping. Sure enough, it was the end of the two chapters. I must admit I was almost insulted that she stopped. I begged her to continue on. By chapter 2 I was already hooked on this book like a drug. Since then, I've read the whole series. I've given NUMEROUS people the same challenge. I've been loaning out my first book, and buying more of it and giving it to my customers at work! This series is so amazing, I want to share it with the world! So, in closing.. I give you this same challenge... Read the first two chapters... if you don't like it.. you can stop. Just keep in mind when you get hooked on this series, you WILL lose sleep, you WILL go to bed later, your time will NOT be bored if you have one of these books with you. You will laugh, cry, get angry and refluff your pillow, you will hope, you will talk about this everywhere you go.. you will think about it every waking moment. You will use this series as an escape from this world. You will do and be a lot of things, however you will not be disappointed. I promise! A life changing story I think that sometimes a book sells well because it came along at the right place at the right time with the right cover art. That must be the case with Wizard's First Rule, because nothing inside justifies it's apparently immense popularity. I'm not saying it was trash, just that anyone who has read more than 5 or so fantasy novels will keep having deja vu, and that more experienced readers will feel patronized by the overly-simplified style.As other reviewers have pointed out before me, the writing is undersophisticated. I would guess the appropriate reading level to be 13 years old, which is actually inappropriate if you assume that the average scifi/fantasy reader is probably quite a bit older than that. If the awkward sentences were supposed to be from the point of view of a kid, then perhaps I could understand, but the hero is a full-grown adult.Even more than the bad dialog and prose, the author seems to have hit every cliche in the genre. The love interest established in the first chapter, starting on a quest to stop an evil lord with a ragtag band that somehow includes a wizard, the enchanted sword, the sorceress they meet along the way who speaks in riddles. A villian named Darken Rahl (Star Wars, anyone?) I could go on, but if this sounds familiar so far, you've had enough to get the picture.Yes, Goodkind has a few smatterings of original ideas, but they're not enough to pull the book off. I only made myself finish it because based on this series' success, I kept hoping that it would get better, and because I have a rule that if it's worth starting, it's worth finishing...but now I'm not so sure.Bottom line: if you're new to fantasy, and/or under 13, this book will be just your speed. I kept hoping for a huge plot twist to squeeze the cliches it is more like a 3.5 stars, but the first law itself is so right and amuzing, that i had to round it up instead of down.becuse this is a very not good book, which is only saved by the concept of trying to trick your enemy instead of stubbing him with a random sharp piece of metal. lack in prose, good plot I liked this book overall. The plot was your pretty standard fantasy fare, but there were enough interesting wrinkles to keep me engrossed. Some other reviewers have commented on the wordy or repetitive nature of the book; I did not find that to be the case. Rather, unlike other novels which cover a lot of ground, and jump around from character to character, this one stays with a scene for a long, long time and slowly builds until that scene concludes and then the next scene is begun. So if you prefer your action fast and furious, with lots of threads simultaneously interweaving, then this is probably not the book for you. Instead you will stay with the same characters as they slowly work their way through a particular part of the story (Westlands, Boundary, Mud People. Agaden Reach, Tamarang, People's Palace pretty much it for 800 pages); I could see that being tedious for some readers who want things to move along faster, it was not so much for me, although I would agree the part with the Mud People started to drag, and the graphic scenes with the Mord-Sith did feel gratuitous so that part could have been trimmed to take some of the brutality out. But overall an enjoyable ride. Enjoyable if slow This book is excellent, there is never a dull moment, it's written well and it's not too technical. There arn't hundred of different characters to remember or complicated alliances, cryptic magical nonsense, or anything like that. So even if you're not used to reading fantasy you can follow what's going on. Unlike Robert Jordan whose books become overly involved to the point where you don't know what's going on anymore unless of course you're used to reading books like that. They do have a lot of reference to magic of course, but it's pretty basic, and when they backtrack and mention history it's also not complicated so when they reference it again as it relates to the present you kinda go \"Oh yeah, I remember that, now it makes sense\" Great UNCOMPLICATED fantasy book This book was great. I couldn't put it down. I swear I broke out in a sympathetic sweat as the character traversed rough terrain and overcame obstacles. This is one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to see the rest of the series on the Kindle. Awesome I literally just finished WIZARD'S FIRST RULE five minutes ago and here I am, about to order the second one. That's how good it is. It's really worth the read. If you are the type that gets scared easily, be warned: it does get a little bloody, but not too much. That's why I give WIZARD'S FIRST RULE four stars instead of five.Be careful of the gars and of when the Seeker, Rahl, or a Mord-Sith kills - it made me uncomfortable, but no story would be good if it didn't have the &quot;bad guy&quot; and all of his demons. And believe me - this book is GOOD!! Recommend this book! Convinced by online critics that Wizard's First Rule was horrific, I never gave Wizard's First Rule a chance in the past; Terry Goodkind's books were crossed off my list without even batting an eye.One of the greatest virtues I have learned later on in life is not to pass judgement on someone's work based on other critics opinions. Donning this mindless logic is an easy trap to fall into; Fooling myself that I had the cognitive ability all great critics do because I apered their words.Terry Goodkind is dyslexic, yet he was able to overcome his handicapp and become a bestselling novelist. Dyslexia brings out the worst and best in people, some give in an quit others are tenacious pitbulls that someone find a way to be successful. Coming from a depressing dyslexic background myself, I can identify with Goodkinds hardship; thus when I was searching for famous dsylexics and stumbled across Goodkind I decided to give his novel a chance.Openings are critical to my judgement of a book; Goodkinds opening to this book is unorthodox and is a refreshing change to the action laden openings all too common in fantasy novels. Subtle and almost impallible, his opening description of a basalm fir ebbs my curiousity. Spoiled I become in Goodkinds lavishly written prose; my thirst for articulate descriptions is sated immediately.Unorthodox writing styles can either make or break a novel, Goodkinds unorthox prose kept my interest all through this book. Some people cringe at the grammatical flaws when they read something unorthodox while others are able to appreciate it's artistic splendor.Creativity is the hallmark sign of a Dyslexic; Undoubtedly, Goodkind is endowed with a flair for creativity other authors so desperately wish they had. A unique unorthodox writing style I read through it, hearing all the good reviews, and I could see some elements that were true fantasy archetypes.However, I felt bludgeoned by a couple things that took me completely out of my immersion. The first was the blatantly evil, blatantly Communist regime.The second was the society of Sado-masochists. I don't see an entire society based on this core concept as one that will last long.These elements, to me, were written in a way that lacked any sense of subtlety. The reader was not tasked with thinking about these elements in this book.I haven't read any more in this series and I won't be re-reading this one any time soon (if ever). Others may find this book to your taste, but not everyone is going to enjoy it. I had to make myself finish it... Do NOT buy this, or any other of Goodkind's books. Here's why:Most of the action sequences happen for no reason other than to have something happen. I mean, in his interviews Goodkind whines and complains that his books are not fantasy even though, give it up man, they are. There's one part in this book towards the end where all of a sudden a dragon comes into play. WHile you are reading this you're thinking, 'why am i reading this?' It's like even though he protests that his novels are NOT of the fantasy genre, he takes the stereotypical elements and puts them in his book. Oh, everything accept elves and dwarves and the like. That, it seems, it too below him.What is really annoying is that after most of his characters meet each other, within moments they are sharing their life stories and comforting each other like they were best friends for life. I don't know about you but it takes me at least more than a few hours of knowing someone before i open up and tell them just about everyhting about me.His main character Richard (wow, how creative on the name front, huh?) runs his hand through his hair on just about every page (check for yourself if you don't believe me) and should be friggin bald by like the third chapter. Kahlan, the other main character, is supposed to be this tough as nails heroine from way arcoss the other side of the UNCROSSABLE boundary. She crosses the boundary, and after meeting Richard and deciding they need to get back through the boundary, they actually look for help in crossing the boundary as if she didn't spend the first part of the book telling him how she crossed and how dangerous it is. Then, after they begin to cross the boundary, friggin Kahlan cries, has tears in her eyes, wipes at her tears, has tears swelling/stinging her eyes and so on and clutches to Richard through the whole process as if she has never even been there! I don't even feel like going it because of how ridiculous the story becomes.There are so many holes in this story that you shouldn't even bother 'renting' it from your library. Goodkind uses commas in his sentences like they are going out of style and puts adverb after adverb in his sentences even more so - a BIG wiriting no no. WHat gets me even more is that he likes to string them to the end of dialogue tags; \"Richard said angrily\", \"Kahlan whispered quietly\", Chase said abgrily\". OMG how was it that he ever even got his book published? You know what? I think that someone saw his 400,000 word manuscript and thought \"hey man, we can get a lot of books out of him so let's do it\" then without even having an editor look at the thing sent it into print.There are actually books written bad on purpose for aspiring writers to read so they can see what NOT to do and Goodkind's books actually resemble them very much. His books are a miracle, alright. It's a miracle they ever got published. Whatever you do, don't waste your money. You'll have a better time re-reading one of you favorite books reguardless of how many times you've already read it.Oh and by the way, this book has a nice BIG SECRET ending that sickens the reader when they get to it. I think Goodkind watched Star Wars one too many times while writing this book because that tired old \"Luke, i am your father\" scene is actually used in his book! HA! HA! HA! That's supposed to be the big twist/spin/surprise of this novel. It sure did that to me when i read it, only it was my stomach that twisted/spun/surprised me when i retasted my lunch. BLAGG to this book, most definately. horrible I learned of these books by watching the television show &#34;Legend of the Seeker&#34;. Whenever presented with the opportunity to read the books over watching the movie or show I of course say &#34;YES&#34; because the books are 90% of the time better. I expected that many things would be different and must say I am pleased with the book overall. However, the author is repetitive in odd places. When things don't need to be repeated, they are repeated multiple times. All-in-all the story is captivating, it just seems to be written for a younger audience I suppose. Great story line, the author is a bit repetitive... I just figured I'd share -- I tried five or six times to try and read this book because it has gotten such good reviews. However, the storyline and characters are atrocious. Clue 1: Richard's evil politician brother early on delivers a diatribe against the evils of fire and how they have to strive against it, and the people listening to him don't think he sounds like a dork, railing against fire? give me a break. Clue 2. After the aforementioned speech, the brother goes over and [touches] Richard's new woman friend Kahlan upon being introduced to her, and while Richard and Kahlan are naturally surprised, their reactions are very inauthentic, and the narration does not bother to point out how ridiculous it is for the brother to come over and [touch] a woman he's never met right in front of his brother. Clue 3: Richard, who is not the adventuring sort, gets the Sword of Truth; he and the woman Kahlan meet up with some ranger friend of Richard's, who despite knowing that Richard is not the adventuring sort, listens to Richard explain how he must go on a quest for about 2 minutes and then very solemnly declares that he will protect them -- as corny as it gets. Other clues -- there's very little originality in the book. Maybe if it had an original concept or magic this would redeem it, but it doesn't. Even the bad guy Darken Rahl has a very derivative name. one of the dumbest storylines ever It was a great book to listen to. Even when I could only listen to and from work each day. suspence full and wonderful. Loved It First and foremost, this book was wonderful! Ignore all the silly nit-picky negative reviews. If you like a good fantasy novel with great character development that doesn't pull any punches, then this is the story for you.It had been at least 7 years since I had really picked up a good book. I had gotten a bit burnt out on the WoT series, and I just couldn't make myself get that same spark I used to get when I picked up a new book. But after 100 pages of this, I couldn't out it down. I poured through it for days until I finally finished it. Now I'm on to book 2!I highly recommend this book for any fantasy lovers out there. Reinvigorated my joy of reading! WIZARD'S FIRST RULE, SWORD OF TRUTH BOOK 1BY TERRY GOODKIND: While Goodkind's first book in his now complete 11-book Sword of Truth series begins with an eerie thorn bush that sends its thorns burrowing beneath your skin as if they were alive which immediately grabs the reader's attention and interest, Wizard's First Rule is a classic first epic fantasy novel that sets the stage for a great series.Richard Cypher is your classic, innocent, ordinary guy who has grown up in a simple family with a relatively simple life. His mother died when he was younger, but his father has supported him and his brother since then. Early on, the reader learns that his father has died mysteriously, to the point where he may have been murdered. Then he meets a woman, Kahlan, fleeing for her life from four men who he helps her to kill. The woman is very beautiful and Richard is immediately smitten with her. When Kahlan meets Richard's good old friend, Zedd, there is a strange connection between them, as if they know who and what each of them are.It is then that the story begins to unfold. Zedd is a powerful wizard who has been in hiding for some time. Kahlan is what is known as a Confessor, a woman with the ability to \"touch\" someone and make them become obsessed with the Confessor and will do whatever they are told. And then the decision is made by Zedd that Richard Cypher is to be the Seeker and bearer of the mighty Sword of Truth. There is an evil man in the far east, Darken Rahl who is taking over, killing many, and looking to control all the known world. It is up to Richard, with the help of Kahlan and Zedd, too stop him.From this description, Wizard's First Rule seems like any ordinary fantasy series, where Richard is a Frodo-type or a Rand-type from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. And yet there is a startling harshness to this series, it is a gruesome world, there is sex and lust, unlike that of Jordan's or Tolkien's worlds. It shocks the reader, but keeps them reading, wanting to know what will happen next.[...] Wizard's First Rule I had heard of the Legend of the Seeker spin off and wanted to see where it stemmed from so I tried this book. This is my first read of a Terry Goodkind book and I really enjoyed it. The characters may seem familiar and the story a bit formulaic but it is excellently crafted with twists and cliffhangers throughout to keep you interested.The book made me desire to know what was going to happen next and this made it very difficult to put down which is the real measure of a book. My only criticism is the level of romance in the book (too much for a macho guy like me!) and the 'love conquers all' theme was a bit over the top sometimes but that's down to personal taste.The fights were brutal, exciting and well written. Several times you read a character doing something and you feel like fist punching the air and saying 'Hell no He did not just do that!' The constant struggle and vulnerability of the characters keeps you cheering for them too.Worth a look! Looking for a good Fantasy book to try out? Try this. I read this book when it was first published and thought that it was worth the read (then again, there's not much of any genre I won't read, and I was only a teenager at the time). My problem now is that since the death of Robert Jordan, I took it upon myself to actually try and slog through the Wheel of Time Series for the first time, and the similarities between this book and his series are just too \"coincidental\". I've read arrogant interviews with Terry Goodkind where he proclaims he has changed the genre and his books are unlike any other, but now I wonder how he had the audacity to actually voice that opinion. (Though many of the similarities are also included in his later books of the series.) Goodkind's \"banelings\" are remarkably similar to Jordan's \"Darkfriends\", the Keeper is Jordan's \"Dark One\", and Richard (the innocent woodsman), like Jordan's Rand (the innocent sheepherder), is usually marked by his sword. SPOILER: The paternal parentage of both boys also come into question in the books. There are many more throughout the whole series, too many for comfort. I'm not sure if anyone else has commented on this, I didn't read all 1300 reviews. Just throwing it out there. Other than that, the first 5 books in the series aren't so bad that I wouldn't read them. True, they are very cheesy and reminiscent of a bad romance novel, but like a really bad horror movie: its so bad, its good. So bad, its good. Goodkind's first book in the sword of truth series sets the standard. His novel ideas set in Richard Cypher's world of fantasy keep the reader turning pages. Amongst its peers in the world of Science Fiction and Fantasy literature, Wizard's First Rule is a cut above the rest. A Creative, fresh breakthrough Wizards First Rule was an easy, enjoyable read; the type of novel to peruse in front of a fire on a cold day. Each character played a specific, defined role and, in some aspects, read like a script. The real star of the novel was the plotline. Still, it was a fun read and I would recommend the book.

         "This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \"wordy\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it! Incredibly Powerful I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella. Amazing depiction of characters that stick with you and linger even after finishing. Amazing Read The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights?\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of. Human Nature VS. The Human Condition. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm not sure how I got through school without reading it and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed it as much in my student days. However, it truly is a wonderful peek into human nature at its worst and at its best. Terrific study in human nature I too am one of those high school kids that was forced to read the book freshman year. But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book. I am not an avid reader but this one was awesome. I could not put this book down. Awesome I love the fact that I can download classic pieces of literature for free on my phone. I don't own a Kindle and only read on my phone when I've forgotten a hard copy of a book. The pages are crisp and clear and I can bookmark easily. Free Classics To say Great Expectation is \"Classic\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired. I highly recommend Great Expectations and eagerly look forward to A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist.Dawn Kurtz author ofSecret of the Mexican Doll Better than a Highschool Read! I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \"great expectations\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \"sponsor\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work. Quintessential 19th Century Period Piece This book is so boring, I have to read it for my Honors Preparation English Liturature and Writing Class. It is really difficult to understand also. A extremely boring book. Understood classic by others, but it bored me. Then again, I had to read this for school. I found it to lack in a real plot. I am a fan of Charles Dickens but this one was not good. Alright- Not that good Great Expectations reveals the life of an orphan, Pip, who is alone in a desolate world even though he lives with his sister. Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life. This novel, in all its intensity is filled with details that make reading enjoyable and very realistic. Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life. A Memorable Experience This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example, the meeting with the convict in the churchyard is where the action starts to pick up. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics. One High School Student's Review Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you of its quintessential nature, but hopefully it will open your mind to possibly the greatest novel of all time. How do you rate heart and soul? I appreciate this edition for its introduction (which is interesting for literature buffs and beneficial for serious students/readers), for the end notes (which are definitely helpful in explaining Victorian allusions and other references for readers who have little or no background or experience with such), for the inclusion of the original ending (which provokes a variety of options for discussion and examination), for the discussion questions, and for the presentation (easy to read pages). My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story). Helpful for students I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres.

Quintessential 19th Century Period Piece I did not like this book. I was unable to finish it. It started off slow and there was nothing about it that was \"great.\" Awful Started off slow and not at all what I expected Over the last few years, every other book I've read has been Dickens. This is, so far, my favorite. It is an absolutely brilliantly woven tale. Dickens was remarkably talented at creating characters that captured the essence of what makes us human to the point that he was able to create characters who are completely real, and might be found walking amung us today. If you are new to Dickens, this would be a great place to start. One of my favorites I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless. Great Book! Pages are all different size and roughly cut. A bit rubbish, really. This is not a reflection on the narative, which of course is well reviewed in general. Looks like a reject book. Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \"Great Expectations\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \"learns his lesson\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone. Worth Reading In Spite of Itself I've always adored Dickens, and even read eight of his novels for a class in undergraduate school. I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \"castle\" and the \"ancient\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile. Frank Muller brought Great Expectations to life This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter. Some chapters start in the middle of disks or even in the middle of tracks. My 7th graders love to listen to it, so it has been worth the aggravation of trying to find which chapter is where. Wonderful Version...horribly organized I had to read this for my AP English class. At first, it didn't catch my attention, but to my english teacher's urging (Mrs. Brodmerkel) I read on. Actually, if she wasn't there to explain each chapter after we had read it, it wouldn't have been As good. This was a great book, and I think everyone should have to read it. There are so many different social conditions that still pertain to life today. Dickens does well in making this novel timeless. Great Book! Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \"classic\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \"Great Expectations\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . . Slow Read This is a wonderful opportunity to read the classics, this book by Dickens gives us an insight in the life of the under privileged in older times. the way Kindle works is great because it has a built in dictionary which becomes very helpful. Great book In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him? A convict wants to give all his money to Pip because he scared him so much he got him to do what he wanted? I could go on some more, but I'm bored, 3 stars for the writing. okay It left me wanting more. This was a very beautifully written love story. I found the attraction between Estella and Finn was more true and captivating then Romeo &amp;Juliet. Wanting more! My objective is to read as many of the classic books as possible. I found this book to be very hard to put down and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. Another Dickens masterpiece! A pleasure to read. I am really enjoying it To be cliched, it is a classic and I would reccomend it to anyone. Great characters, some mystery, humour and emotion. excellent this story is timeless. Could have been a Greek Tragedy. The image of ms backhand, waiting... Moves me. Excellent work! dickens Sgt pepper The classic story we've known, loved, and shared with our children.However the page size of this edition is so small, it makes the book difficult to read and overly thick.Given the choice, I'd pick a version with a more conventional size. Great classic story! Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that. Great Expectations for Great Expectations? I down loaded \"Great Expectations\" after hearing some friends talk about it. This electronic translation was ALMOST perfect but the few mess ups were tolerable (and distinguishable). I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to explore a well written piece of classic literature. Great Classic!!!!! This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-) It's great. This is a true classic that everyone should read at least once in their lives. I loved it and will read it again and again! Classic Must Read This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \"I'm rich and you're not,\" and \"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring. BO-RING! Who knew that a book written almost 150 years ago could be so great? Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \"Mrs. Joe\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \"rampages\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Expectations Greatly Exceeded Some audio books are unlistenable, with inept hammy actors mucking up the text. I recently had that experience with one of my favorite books, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which was so appallingly read by a horrible ham, I would have thrown the CDs out the car window if they hadn't belonged to my local library.This GREAT EXPECTATIONS is probably the best \"book on CD\" I've ever heard. Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature. Classic novel SUPERBLY read by Michael Page This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm. A classic for all times. The book \"The Great Expectations\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \"turn around\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end. Cadillac's Review Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read. Great Expectations Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book Not my cup of tea Great Expectations follows Pip's life goes from childhood to adulthood with many twists and turns. Some predictable others unexpected. Many hours of good reading. Good Read I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books! CHARLES DICKENS IS EXTREMELY OVERATED! I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \"Great Expectations\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\"Great Expectations\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \"Great Expectations\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \"Great Expectations\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \"Great Expectations\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \"Hard Times\" and let those who want more seek out \"Great Expectations\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here. A true masterpiece This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book. Abridged copy I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class. A celebration of the middle class One of my favorite books of all time. A love story with a twist and very well conceived but the author. Great book.. The best This is a great classic. One of my favorite books by Dickens.A book everyone should read at least once....(though you will probably read it more than once!!!!) Love Great Expectations!!!!! I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+ Social commentary, mystery, romance and a great story... This book was almost as good as A Tale of Two Cities (I read the two Back to Back.) It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes. A good classic read. A Close Rival to A Tale Of Two Cities This is a priceless piece of history that reads excellently on my Droid device. This book has a tale that never gets old. priceless It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \"having already been read\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition. Read the Masters as an Adult! Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages. Slow start, but riveting end I recently reread this wonderful classic and was mesmerized by it all over again - a must read for anyone who has not read this book. A timeless classic What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic. Outstanding - one of my all-time favorites! Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere. This book is another classic, telling the great story of a once simple orphan boy named Pip. I greatly enjoyed this book, with Charles Dickens' enticing use of imagery, it is sure to keep anyone reading. This book could make one cry, and smile. And to me, for it to cause any sort of such emotion, it has to be a truly lovely book to read. If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \"Great Expectations.\" A Charles Dickens Classic; Four stars! When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+ this is what we read for There really aren't words for this book. The characters were as lifelike as possible, the plot was intreeging, and the writing was supperb. I am only 12, but I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read. What can I say? Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are. An Amazing Story This is often listed as a reading requirement for college and high school classes alike, I read it in college. But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good. But even the best of author's can have a mess-up every now and then and \"Great Expectations\" is certainly not one that I would recommend reading. Not as great as I expected When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \"intellectual\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century. pure enjoyment This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slow, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example the meeting with the convict in the churchyard. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics. One High School Student's Review Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \"grown-ups\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day. Possibly the greatest novel of all time In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb. High Laurie (TV's House) reads Great story written by a great author! No complaints!The way he described the boy's thoughts, the way he described the environment, etc, so attracting.BTW, there are indeed pictures in the book. Great book! Great Expectations Saw the movie and loved it so figured the book had to be better.I wanted to read it for years Great Expections Great Expectations was not that great of a novel. I found it to be dull and a bit on the boring side. Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal! Not a Bestseller I had a chance to see the film several times. I really loved it. It is a bitter-sweet love-story of a boy with deep feelings. It is not an easy-to-read book, not everyone will like it. It is much better, than the film I also like. Sweet story Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it. (I've read an abridged version four or five times!) Slow but certainly worth a read OK. I like reading and everything but when I read at the begining of this school year, I was bored out of my mind through the whole book. I found absolutly no point to this book Boring I got into reading a lot this past fall and haven't been able to stop. I read in a couple of different series one of the main characters mention reading a few old books from Great Britain. I decided to read them to see what I was missing out on. I love this book. I never care for endings... that means I have to find a new book!!! LOL but this has up, downs, twists and turns; I am so glad I took the time to read it. Oldie but Goodie Any one with a passion for literature (and those who don't) should read Great Expectations. Not only is the story itself wonderful, but Dickin's underlying messages of about life and circumstances that lead people to their destinies are amazing. While a bit wordy at times, the style is superb and outlives the era to speak to modern people as well as it did one hundred years ago. Please, don't let your view of Dickins be &quot;old&quot;! This book is as relevent today as it was when first published. Read it today! An amazing book Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper Too Many COINCIDENCES!! I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+ Social commentary, mystery, romance and a great story... Loved reading this classic again. Enjoyed it as a youth but as an adult, it had a more realistic effect on me. Excellent classic. Better the second time I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \"must read\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece. Great classic story! I was an avid reader, but somehow things changed in my life, but thanks to my Kindle I am getting back to reading. With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \"classics\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read. Classic book, glad I finally read it. Great Expectationsby Charles Dickens; I know that had I been required to read this book for 9th grade English, I'm pretty sure that I would have hated it. As it was it took me better than a month to get through the first half of the story... and then I raced through the second half in a couple of days on my Christmas Kindle. A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work. Lots of interesting examinations of British class separation and discrimination, expectations, and dry humor. Looking forward to more by Dickens. my first by Dickens Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written. Great Expectations I remember really liking this book the first time I read it. The second go around, not so much. Oliver Twist is a much better Dickens novel. It's Okay i was first introduced to this book through the summer reading required at my school. I wrote ten pages about the story of Pip's journey through British life and how he changed as a person....It was not a happy journey for me, i just want that out in the open. I had to pore over endless details from a book that was confusing enough to read anyways. I do not recommend this book, especially if your looking for a cheap thrill...there is none. I think that if you sequestered enough polygamy to get you through Kenneth Branaugh's Hamlet, then maybe MAYBE, you can get through this boring, endless, fairytale of a novel. Thank you, and good night. a book of a lifetime Love it! Still love it and will continue to love this timeless story. Now i am sharing it with my kids. Great Expectations never disappoints! I loved this book. However unlike others, this one keeps things somber. It is not some frilly romance novel but a little more realistic with many twists and turns. realistic The classics are always good to re-visit, this is one of Dickens best. There are always subtleties missed at the first reading Dickens the great For the price a very sweet deal. have had it for 2 months now and no problems. would buy again from this company school This classic was all I thought it would be & more. Descriptions wonderful. Characters stay with you. Dickens moves a story along in his own unique way.GKE Met my expectations Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed! fantastic twists , fateful turns, humorous, and good morals and much more! Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \"brought up by hand\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \"friend\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \"Great Expectations\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \"Great Expectations,\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \"a man in waiting\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \"Great Expectations,\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \"Great Expectations\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \"Great Expectations\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \"I saw no parting from her.\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \"Great Expectations\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \"Great Expectations\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip. Redemptive Themes are Always Among my Favorites in Books This book could have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length novel it lacks both and entertaining plot and characters that one can truly empathize with. A short story told in 400 pages. Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \"Bildungsroman\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \"Nicholas Nickleby\",\"David Copperfield\" and \"Great Expectations\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \"David Copperfield\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \"Great Expectations\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\"Great Expectations\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \"oncommon\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \"by hand\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \"marry her by hand\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \"David Copperfield\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \"David Copperfield\" thoroughly before writing \"Great Expectations\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \"Great Expectations\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \"common\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \"old convict\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \"Great Expectations\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft. A Saga of Human Expectations and Failures I got a few classics for the kindle app, can't go wrong with ant classics in my opinion! Better yet, they were free!!!!! Gotta love it! Reaching deep into himself, Dickens created this novel of moral exploration, high comedy, and page-turning narrative power. Pip, an orphan raised by his bullying siter and her sweet-naured blacksmith husband, discovers one day that he has a mysterious benefactor. The good-hearted Pip suddenly has &quot;great expectations&quot; of his life and begins to reject spiritual values for materialistic ones. Depspite his financial windfall, things don't go well for Pip. Estella, the beautiful but haughty young woman he loves, coldheartedly tortures him. And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip. Great Expectations represents one of Dicken's greatest triumphs. It manages to be both funny and moving. A Great Worldwide Classic &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history.

Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\" Marvellous I had to read this book for my English class and at first it was so boring! It about a young boy named Pip and he is trying to find his true indentity. At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a &quot;gentleman&quot; because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring. Boring beginnig, Good ending I had not read this book since I was at school many years ago. Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are. I would recommend to any one wanting to read some of the old classics. Great Expectato s After having a very diffiult time enjoying A Tale of Two Cities, which I found to be unappealing, austere, and excessively verbose, I was prepared to denounce this book as well. However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance. A pleasant surprise and a fine read First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated! A \"Regular People\" Review This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic. To conclude, I belive that the chapters are cycled like story line with many charictors and an entire chapter with Pip talking to himself and talking about his expectations. Thank you for reading my review. This book was a very big disappontment Clean good story. Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand. Great This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free. Had to have it. one of the classics Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: `Too long, Sir!' `Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to `teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of `reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better. One of the Best, but ... The way the story started just pulls you to know more to know where it is leading. A great book by a great author Classic I enjoyed this edition, I am happy with the endnotes and the inclusion of the original ending. A good read and a great edition &quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story. While a very good book I Expected it to be better i was first introduced to this book through the summer reading required at my school. I wrote ten pages about the story of Pip's journey through British life and how he changed as a person....It was not a happy journey for me, i just want that out in the open. I had to pore over endless details from a book that was confusing enough to read anyways. I do not recommend this book, especially if your looking for a cheap thrill...there is none. I think that if you sequestered enough polygamy to get you through Kenneth Branaugh's Hamlet, then maybe MAYBE, you can get through this boring, endless, fairytale of a novel. Thank you, and good night. a book of a lifetime This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \"wordy\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it! Incredibly Powerful What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic. Outstanding - one of my all-time favorites! Great book! Very deep reading - life lesson with so much meaning. All members portrayed different characteristics that had a major effect in the life of Pip. Everyone should read before starting life's journey. Great expectations I have always been an avid reader, always in search for a book that would enlighten and ispire me. Great Expectations by Charles Dickens fulfilled this. It is a compelling story about a young man who through a series of circumstances meets a beautiful yet cold hearted girl named Estella. The book follows him through his adolence an adult years. To me this book still hold very true today. It tells about love and how time may not heal all wounds. And also about how some people are manipulated, as Estalla was, into living out others lives. An Inspiring Classic Excellent book. Great tie in of all the characters and relationships of each to the main character. I preferred the author's original ending. Great Expectation Appropriate Title First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated! A \"Regular People\" Review This came at indicated. I was going to get it for my Ipad but it is for my daughter for High School and so she would need to take it each day to school so I got it at the end of school and it was a great price. Great expected This is the classic version of Dickens's masterpiece. It is very nicely done and very enjoyable. From my point of view the price is fair for what you get. It is not a cheap copy from the corner bookstore but also not overpriced. The quality is totally fine and it looks nice . About the story, well you can read that in the other reviews or look for it on the internet. I really enjoyed reading it and would recommend it at any time.Regards,B. very nice book Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times. An Bittersweet Rite of Passage Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book. Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have. The Height of My Expectations A journey of place and time, yes; but above all a journey of heart. Pip's retrospective honesty gave me cause to reflect upon my own errors through the years and ultimately celebrate our shared human capacity to grow in heart and spirit. Entrancing I am a teacher and tried last year to read and teach this novel but used the original. (6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer. great expectations! Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb. It is also very easy to read. The plot is well developed and the number of characters and the interaction of subplots is masterful.When a terrified four year old Pip is coerced into bringing an escaped convict food, he sets into motion a chain of events that will determine the direction of his life and explain that of others. Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him. And the lovely Estella, for whom he craves, could she be part of this inheritance? Why is someone grooming him to be a gentleman? Who? All these questions and more are answered as the story unfolds in this powerful work. Great Introduction to Dickens This book is classic Dickens. It's a winner. It lives up to my expectations. Anyone who loves Dickens will enjoy this book. Again we see a young person growing up on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" become a hero in his own right. Pip learns many things in his journey and comes to terms with the folks who shaped his understanding, even though they are simple folk. Great Expectations Granted GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today. Things Aren't Always What They Appear To Be. Pip is an orphan. His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \"play,\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \"Great Expectations.\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon. I always have Great Expectations when it comes to Dickens... This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend. An enjoyable read. Amazing, classic, and beautifully written. A strange pauper-gone-prince tale where all the threads of fate's loom are intertwined frequently. Amazing! Great Expectations Though this is a decent, affordable edition of Dickens' late masterpiece, any mildly curious reader should buy the Oxford Classics edition instead. The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime). Great novel, not so great edition I enjoyed reading this book in my school days. Its a very great book with a good story.One of the greatest works by Charles Dickens. Very Good Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel. Very Good Story How cold you not love this book? It's a classic. The internal struggle Pip goes through and crazy old Miss Havisham are brought to life through the author's mastery of the written word. Dickens Classic I love the free books for the Kindle. They greatly expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library as well as allow us to keep a copy as long as we need. school resource Since a potential buyer might be wondering which edition to buy, I've decided to give a brief review of the edition instead of one of the story.This is the 2003 reissue of the 1986 edition of the Bantam classic edition. This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \"caved in\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \"more acceptable.\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \"happily ever after\" one so much as one that leaves the door open. I can't think of anything more suitable for a book entitled \"Great Expectations.\" What's in addition in this edition As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!! Emotional and Suspenseful Great Expectations was not that great of a novel. I found it to be dull and a bit on the boring side. Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal! Not a Bestseller I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime. If the schools are trying to expose antsy kids to Dickens, they may be better served with A Tale of Two Cities, which moves a bit faster in my opinion. From A Different Era The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\" whats going to happen next?\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory. in my own words I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations. Expectations Prevail I enjoy Dickens, so when I decided to read Great Expectations, I had just that... Great expectations. Unfortunately, this novel is the most boring tripe I've ever read. The 'hero' is nothing but a whiner with a 'poor me' complex.Don't waste your time, read one of Dickens' other books. Great Expectations - Major Disapointment! I am amazed that it took me 61 years to get around to reading this book. I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon... A Fantastic Story To say Great Expectation is \"Classic\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired. I highly recommend Great Expectations and eagerly look forward to A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist.Dawn Kurtz author ofSecret of the Mexican Doll Better than a Highschool Read! Definitely not a modern read, but that can be a good thing. The style of of writing in Mr. Dickens's era may seem a little over the top by current literature, but the character's grab you, you want to know how they do, what they do. Inlove good storytelling. Read in context... The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild. Good seller. good buy Charles Dickens is absolutely classic. I read this book in high school myself, now my son is reading it. I'm sure he'll enjoy. It's a brand new paper back book at a great price. You can't go wrong buying this. Classic book at a classic price I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once. Dicken's Best Book In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb. High Laurie (TV's House) reads Who knew that a book written almost 150 years ago could be so great? Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \"Mrs. Joe\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \"rampages\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. Expectations Greatly Exceeded This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\" The Hobo Philosopher Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions. My personal favorite movie version of Great Expectations is the 1999 Masterpiece theatre version. a high school boy's review This book was literally the worst thing thats happened in my whole entire life.I was forced to read this long. boring book for english class and either fell asleep, or sat there and sared off into spce.THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!The only GOOD thing about this book is that I hav found a new way to doze off without sum sleeping pills (just read the first two pages and WALLA ure fast asleep!!!!!!!) HORRID!!!!! Reading isn't usually something I choose to do in my spare time. My daughter was reading this for school, so I decided to read it too because of her reaction to it. This is not your every day novel! The more I read it, the madder I got. I couldn't read it for an extended amount of time, because I would become too angry to continue. But then I had to pick it up again to find out what happened. This book is a pure emotional ride. I love it! Love/Hate Reading Well written and the drawings are wonderful. The story itself is well written and put in a time period which was a difficult time for children who didn't have much finances or many options to obtain employment they would enjoy. the thoughts through the boys eyes are amazing after all the situations he gets into. even a little trouble could be a really big deal back then. Great Read I am so sorry I didn't get to this before today...I thought I had done it already.....please forgive me....totally my fault....I have so enjoyed this wonderful book and its just as described...thanks again..will buy from you often....GREAT SELLER!!!! AAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++ Classic Book I started reading this over a month ago and I'm still not finished. I can't get into it at all! It's like a really boring nightmare! I mean, the parts that take place at Satis House are mildly interesting, but no part of it seems to be building up to anything. The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't! It's just sitting there in its stupid rocking chair knitting and petting its cat by the fire, which isn't even burning! OMG!You want to read something fast paced and interesting?Try Daniel White's Hellstone, available right here at amazon.com (plug). Now that's a good book. White's influences span the ages, and don't skip Victorian, if that's what you're into, which you obviously are, or why would you be here?Don't get me wrong. I like Victorian literature. A Christmas Carol is a very good story, as is Dracula, and Frankenstein, and most of Poe's works. It's just this particular book that I don't like...and anything by Jane Austen.In conclusion, buy Hellstone. You'll be happy you did. Hello! My name is Pip! I'm an annoying little crybaby with no personality! Will you join me for tea and crumpets? i received the book today and it is brand new! great book and i recommend this book for all ages Great Product The reason that I chose this book was because I saw the play at my high school.I thought that this play was performed really good by the student body,so i decided to read the book, and the book was pretty good. I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together. Great Expectations Review I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect. The old english styled language at first was a bit difficult to comprehend the first few chapters, so it took me a while to read them. However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend. A classic, must read. This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book. Great Book - if you read it all. Clean good story. Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand. Great",

         "A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)",
         "This was the first IAD book that I read--and I was blown away. Fabulous characters. Great twisting plot. This story definitely puts a new spin on paranormal romance. The hero was dark, and he struggled with his growing feelings for the heroine. The action was non-stop, and I couldn't put the book down. I like werewolf heroes, but Cole took her hero to a whole new level. And pairing him with a half-vamp heroine...so good! Definitely recommend this book. Hooked on Immortals After Dark Lachlian a Scottish Werewolve (the king of the Weres) from the highlands. He is angry, bitter, mentaly unstable, strong as sin, and so hot its painful.He is tourtured undergrown by Vampires for almost 200 years when he finally escapes. He finds the streagth to do so because he smells his fated mate above ground and thinks that his only refuge will be to find her; that with-in her he can heal his emotional wounds and all that good stuff.When he gets loose by tearing off his own leg (no worries it regenrates in a week), hits the streets of Paris on a rampage and finds her. Its then that he discovers to his outrage she is a Vampire. He lothes Vampires, which is understandable, seeing how he was toutoured by them for 200 years.The chapater in which he captures her, by chasing her down in the rain and climbing ontop of her in a park is oh so shamefully good!She is scared near to death. One -- she's never been away from home, has never seen a Werewolve, and was raised by druid/elfs/witches so she has never even seen a Vampire other then herself. She has no idea what he wants of her and no idea of what he entends to do with her. She is young for an imortal only in her 70's and her name is Emmaline.He makes her take him to her hotel room where he plans to make up for all that time in hell. Since she is a Vampire he can't help but treat her badly; he doesn't want his mate to be a leach. Then again he is torn, he doesn't want to loose his mate after waiting for so long. the guy has been underground for 200 years and isn't right in the head to put it midly.Emmaline is pretty liakble, you feel for her. She is young minded and neive. In the middle of the book she is a tad inmature and annoying, but that changes. The story is great. Emmaline never knew her parents. Her mother killed herself and her father just happens to be the head baddy Vamp of the \"Horde\" a warring faction of Vampires who drink to kill. When Emmaline finds this out its a shame because her father just happens to be the man that put Lachlian away for all that time.Emmaline has to do some soul searching and it envolves confronting her father - I won't spoil it sorry, but the last half of the book is thrilling!Great book!!! Super hot Werewolve! I never thought Werewolves could be Hot till this book! This was the first book I read from the author kresley cole and I haven't looked back. I have bought every single book from this author. It has everything a story should include: chemistry, love, passion, action, adventure ect. She is one of my top three authors. Loved the book After enduring years of torture from the vampire horde, Lachlain MacRieve, leader of the Lykae Clan, is enraged to find the predestined mate he's waited millennia for is vampire. But now he has scented her, his mate, the one woman for him alone. I love the way he Loves Emma,(his Emmaline) With all of his revenge and hate for Vampire's, he could have done her great harm, but he did not. I like the way, the story was written, I went out and got the next book(No Rest for the Wicked). The Immortals After Dark Series I am not much on writing long Reviews but I will say that I am very glad I read the whole book and didn't put it down or stop in between. It was an awesome read and very SEXY and HOT. I enjoyed this book and it is worth your time. I am glad I read I was looking for something after Black Dagger Brotherhood Series and this was a PLEASANT surprise to say the least. ROMANCE, LUST, ADVENTURE, SUSPENSE..and plenty of PARANORMAL activity ... great book!!!!!!!! FROM START TO FINISH ADDICTIVE Lachlain is the long lost king of the Lykae Clan, taken captive by the Horde Vampire Clan for the last 150 years tortured endlessly in the fire pits below the city of Paris, France. Emma the Timid is the cherished, sheltered and protected half Vampire and half Valkyrie raised by her Valkyrie aunts. Emma has never seen another Vampire and certainly not one of those animalistic Lykae. Emma is in Paris looking for information on the father she never knew, Lachlain is chained to the fire below the city when he scents Emma and knows she's his mate. Lachlain severs his leg to escape the pits to get to his fated mate. Emma is alone and hungry in the city when an enraged beast grabs her and forces her to take him back to her hotel. Lachlain is enraged that fate would give him a vampire as his fated mate! He decides then and there he will make her pay for all the years that he was held captive by her kind. Will Emma the Timid's gentle nature tame the wild beast?In this book Emma really grows as a character going from Emma the Timid to Emma the King Killer. Throughout the book you watch as Emma develops a back bone and starts living up to both sides of her heritage. Using the training her aunts forced on that she never excelled at, no longer is Emma the Timid running from sword practice and avoiding conflict but a true Valkyrie in the flesh with silver in her eyes and passion in her heart. By the end of the book you kind of feel like a proud momma watching your little girl grow up and become a woman as she stands up not only to her fierce man but her exceedingly difficult aunts.Lachlain as a character I am somewhat torn. As a male that was tortured for 150 years I expected him to be more tortured in mind and spirit. I tend to like my \"tortured\" males to be more brittle and haunted in spirit except for a couple of rages he seems to keep it together better than you would expect of a man/beast that was kept in the pits of hell for over a century. As an overbearing over protective Lykae he plays the part perfectly. You can't help but like him and keep hoping he is able to win over Emma in his botched attempts to win her heart. Kresely Cole really helps you get into Lachlain's character while writing with the Scottish brogue. It is absolutely delicious!Overall this is a great read; there is plenty of action in and out of bedroom. You get to watch Emma grow as a women and Lachlain struggle not only to win Emma over but to acclimate to the 21st century that he has been thrust into, having never seen a TV or a car. You are introduced to new characters that you will be seeing in several books to come. And as always you find yourself laughing from Kresley Cole's humor. I love a book that can make both your heart race from the steamy passion and then turn around and make you laugh. I'm hungry for more Kresley Cole I absolutely loved this book! I'm currently reading the 3rd in the series \"wicked deeds on a winter's night\". I enjoyed the 2nd and I am enjoying the 3rd with plans to read all in the series. Loved it! Great novel, I liked how it started and focused on the main couple, not going to other stupid topics, like many other paranormal novels~However what really made me like this story was lachlain, i like his nature, the way he thinks. ^_^as for emma, she was emotional, and had a unique personality, which made for a more intresting story :)I'm very thankful to the friend that recommended this story to me~&lt;3 &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 Plenty of details about the book can be found on other reviews..so I'll go ahead and dive into a different sort of review! I've been reading romance novels since I was 13 years old and much to my dismay the genre has taken a downhill nose dive lately. I'm a huge fan of Feehan but I find that her newer books in the Dark Series lacked the excitement of previous installments! I was skeptical when I picked up my copy of A Hunger Like No Other but much to my utter delight I adored it! Run out and grab a copy you won't be disappointed! Ms. Cole does an amazing job with this book and I'm very eager for the next installment! If you feel bored with romance lately, you won't with this!!! Sizzling, Funny, and a perfect story is all found between the pages of this one! My keeper shelf hasn't seen a book in a while...this has an honorary place on that shelf now! Holy Hotness Batman! Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on \"Lover Awakened\" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ...Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ...Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ... I was SO disappointed I liked the vampires, the lycans, the valkaries.I liked the way the story was told. I just liked this book.Can't wait to get the second in the series! Hurry up Amazon and send it to me!!! I really liked this one! The IAD books are great but the beginning of A Hunger Like No Other was amazing, I have never been so grabbed by a book before this. I hope everyone will read and enjoy this book as I have. the best beginning of any book ever In the beginning, they seem unlikely. As the story wound on I kept waiting for chemistry between Emma and Lachlain. But he kept being forceful and she kept hating him. When I hear about relationships that are like this from friends I think \"Those two need to break up...now!\"What really bugs me is if Emma can't lie and she's \"the good one of the two\" (if that's possible--they're both monsters!) why doesn't she give a damn that her people have tortured Lachlain for 150 years and that's the real reason he's been so gruff with her, because he's still hurting about that. And she's mourning the fact that she's an outcast hybrid breed. Both have parents who are dead, so, I guess that makes the couple even more of \"headcases\".The bottom line is as the story goes on, your hope for these two fades faster and faster and by the time they actually \"do it\" on page 250, I really don't care anymore. The author has made it such an unenjoyable read and I don't believe that they'd want to \"do it\" at that point. Why??? What has changed so much by page 250? She just took his gifts (a locket and horse), and didn't even say thank you. What a spoiled princess! If it was me, I'd be highly insulted and would snatch the gifts back.Honestly I might skim to the end, but after page 250, I set the book down and just want to go to her next book. I've heard that's the best one.EDIT: I did read the ending. It was actually pretty good, I wish the rest of the book had been like that. Emma growing up at the end was great.EDIT #2: After reading all six books in the Immortals After Dark series, and the prequel \"The warlord wants forever\" I have to say, I LOVE THIS SERIES. If you don't like book one, go on to the other five books and the prequel, which I enjoyed ten times more. With each book Kresley won my heart until by the sixth book, Kiss of a Demon King, I accepted the fact than I'm a full-on fan girl now! Kresley is awesome! These two need to just stop! This author knew exactly what she wanted and how to accomplish it. This magnificent novel is one to never forget especially with the realistic characters, perfect plot, and wonderful ending. This series is one of my favorite. I just hope she keeps on writing. (Hopefully she'll start working on nix's story.) Hungry for more!!!! I have been seeing this series come up in comments on paranormal pages I subscribe to so I decided to give it a read. Wow! I was hooked from the first page! The characters were amazing! The story pacing was great (it was very hard to put this book down to go to bed) and I am absolutely looking forward to every book in this series! And anything else written by Kresley Cole! Hungry for more This series has been recommended to me constantly on every internet board and from all my friends and family who read books similar to me. I finally gave in and bought a few of them. Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy are two of my very favorite genre's. I've greatly enjoyed many different books from the Dark Hunter to the Carpathian series and from Kate Daniels to Mercy Thompson.I cannot think of a time I've been this disappointed in a book or series. I didn't like the characters at all. Emma was a whiny, spoiled, timid little thing - and even the ending could not save my opinion of her. Lachlain deserved far better than what she was offering that's for sure. As for him he started strong and then deteriorated to some whipped puppy giving Emma baubles and trinket's and hoping she'd stay. He's the Lykae king? Really?There are some other characters introduced as well - I found all of Emma's \"Aunt's\" to be obnoxious and without too many redeeming qualities. They're very weird as well. I still, after I finished the book, hardly understand what they are, what that means, and how they are all connected. And the way they talk - OIY! Juvenile and insipid - they sound like they are trying to be teenage girls. It just comes off as extremly lame. Lachlain's contingency was better - his brother, assistant, and the female werewolf were pretty good.As for the plot it too started out strong like Lachlain but it fizzled mightily in the middle wandering a bit aimlessly. The last 50 pages actually brought my rating from 1 star to 2. To be honest much of the book left me confused about how this world worked - and why. It was too much and not enough information at all once.And the romance - start, stop, start, stop, start, stop and so on and so on and so on until you want to scream. Unfortunately not in a good way! The sexual tension seemed forced and awkward. The scenes themselves were written fine - the characters just didn't fit well.I see this book gets good reviews but I cannot figure it out. When my sister called last night to ask me how the books were even she was shocked at my reaction. I did ask about the rest of the series and if they got better and then she told me \"the news\" that the next book is about one of the \"aunt's\" (the ones who raised Emma). Ugh. No thank you times 10! I don't think this series will be for me but I'll try one more. If you've got a recommendation for which one you'd recommend please share it.I don't have to love a character to like a novel - and on occasion I've even hated a character and loved a novel. However I cannot deal with characters that annoy me so much I want to throw the book across the room. Probably the biggest book shock I've had in years as far as expectations. I'm full thank you very much - majorly disappointed! Technically this is Kresley's first full novel and I am going to say that it was wonderful. Her most recent stuff is better but that doesn't mean that I don't give two thumbs up to this one. Lachlan, after being tortured for 150 years scents his mate and will do anything to get her. Poor Emmaline is gentler than a fly but after meeting Lachlan she toughens up and becomes his Mate. Even killing a vampire in the process. It wasn't easy to make Emmaline fall for Lachlan though. Read to find out how he did it. I will say her lust for him was one key part ;) Wish I was a Valkyrie Loved it can't get enough of the lore!Was caught from page one. Cole has the best characters and story lines. Again loved it! Hunger like no other A hunger like no other was really a delicious read but what stopped me from giving this book a five star review was that Emmaline (the Heroine who was half valkyrie and half vampire) managed to get on my nerves quite a few times. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying the chemistry her and Lachlain shared.Both the hero and heroine's coming together was just sizzling H-O-T. It left me wishing that my room had an air conditioner. What made it even better was all the sexual tension the two shared right up until that moment.Lachlain is one of those alpha-males (and he's a werewolf!) that you don't want to miss reading about. By the end of the book, I was waiting for my very own Lachlain to appear, claim me as his mate and then kidnap me away.I warn you ladies, if you're going to pick up this book, make sure you have either a box of chocolates or an available man handy so that you can take out your sexual frustrations after you're done reading! Absolutely Scrumptious Admission: I have never read a romance novel before A Hunger Like No Other. I write myself (don't we all), and I read mostly things with cobwebs on'm. Faulkner, Dostoevsky, Handyman's Guide to the Cursed HomeOwner--you know, no modern fiction. But I've always been fascinated by the vampire myth, and it hasn't left me. Quite the opposite as I approach death myself. The dark world is darker around me, but this Kindle demanded to be fed, and I said, read some good vampire book, thriller. Stephen King is too wordy and not much there anymore. What to do? I scrounge around the net (like a lykae through a Valkyrie garbage dump), and I finally found this K. Cole who many said wrote interesting things. Well, god bless its little heart, the Kindle delivers up samples of the books it's offering, and I think that if a book can't start well and grab you, then screw it. I downloaded \"A Hunger....\" and it caught my interest. Try reading the beginning offered unto you, and you decide. My screenwriter side said immediately, this is very visual. That means movie or t.v. series. Why, you ask? Because it's a love story struck from the white marble of wildly improbable lovers, a world unseen by humans that coils around our reality, and a great gift for writing supremely erotic passages but staying within the bounds of eumpemistic altruistic good taste (and believe me, there's a lot of tasting going on between various creatures). Ms. Cole obvious realizes that even werewolves and vampire and strange critters from the halls of ancient pagan imaginations need to lick and suck and swat at shapely butt. Our author wraps quite a deep seated wildness around the cobwebs of darkdom, and it works! Plus she weaves the language of the modern world in with mythical creatures that seem would only exist outside the world. No, we are in the world, but this world of Ms. Coles is big enough for lots of furry, hot-bodied critters. I read Ms. Cole is married and has kids. I would imagine, that Ms. Cole has padded her bedroom with foot thick oaken walls, redolent with the scent of old blood and screams of pleasure kept from her kids. Her descriptions of love making and lust are so real and so accurate, that no imagination could have conjured them up without at least experiencing most of what ere she writes. And it goes to show yah, that even regular folks, walking around the mall may be incredible lovers and romantic as all get out, but we only can hope, huh?One more thing I admire about her book: she knew how to finish it. Usually, the hardest thing to do with a movie, book, play is to have a good ending. Beginnings are a dime a dozen. And working one's way through from the beginning is just labor, usually. But to have a coherent whole, and a day new mount of edible proportions (with a bit of incest hinted at) makes for some wild narrative directions and conclusions.If you want a sexy, strange, but vaguely familiar book to read with one's hand perched nearby, just in case--then read this one. You can hold a Kindle with one hand. I promise you. And so, in Florida, lives this blond housewife with her family, and her very lucky husband from in the depths of them all springs forth red hot writing, writhing, and wanton abandon. And lots of cool sword play and nasty ways of torurting vampires.... stuff I'd never thought of--the ramifications of being immortal and always being able to heal...... Ms. Cole coldly makes that the stuff of a level of Hell Dante's Virgil could never have stumbled across.Buy the thing. Read it. Emma, you hot little wench. Such a baby-doll of a vampire, but what a supremely carnal and sensual babe you became! Green Grow the Lykae With alomost all of my favorite Paranormal/Paranormal Romance authors letting me down with thier latest releases, Sherrilyn Kenyon and L.K. Hamilton being the biggest let downs, I was beginning the think the genre was on it's way out.Thank you Kresley Cole for restoring my faith! This was a huge breath of fresh air and brilliant writing. Her paranormal world is vast, interesting and filled with wonderful people you can't wait to know more about. Her Hero and Heroine are spot on! I can't thank KC enough for helping to keep the genre fresh are exciting while others are failing. Finally! I loved this book and hope it becomes a new series! I will totally be getting more books by Cole. A Hunger Like No Other This book was hot, steamy, AND had a plot! The author didn't take up the whole book with superfluous love scenes, but the love scenes it did have were well integrated, storyline appropriate, and definitely left you panting for more.Emmaline Troy is a rare female vampire/valkryie hybrid. She lives with her coven of Valkyrie who have raised her since she was a baby when her own mother, the legendary Helen of Troy, died. She doesn't know who her father is since her mother refused to tell anyone. On a trip to Paris she hopes to find information that will lead her to her father. Unbeknownst to her Lachlan the king of the Lycae (werewolves) lies trapped beneath the city, burning continually. With his superhuman senses he detects his mate in the city above. In a crazed, mad frenzy he amputates his own leg (don't worry it regenerates) in order to get free and find his mate who he has waited for for over a thousand years. Following her scent he tracks his mate down. To his horror (and hers) he discovers his mate is a hated vampire, the very creatures responsible for his imprisonment and continual burning for centuries. Outraged and half-insane he takes out his fury on Emma. Eventually, his anger ceases but its too late now for Emma (known as Emma the Timid) is terrified of him. Eventually, they come to love each other. But just as they are settling into their relationship Emma comes to a horrible realization. Her father is Demestriu, King of the Vampire Horde, and the one responsible for killing Lachlan's brother and imprisoning him. Believing that she is tainted, and that Lachlan will hate her because of her father, Emma flees to Demestriu's hidden palace to kill him. Surprisingly, she accomplishes what so many have failed to do, her father's death. But she is mortally wounded and heads back to her Valkyrie coven. Lachlan tries to see her but the Valkyrie distrust him and refuse to let him see her. Eventually everything gets worked out and they all live happily ever after. This book is a great beginning in this new paranormal romance series with great descriptions and in depth characterizations. This is a definite must read! Great Start for a New Series I really liked this book. It was a good start to the series. I fell in love with characters and wanted more after I finished reading it. Kresley Cole did not dissapoint! Great first book to The Immortals After Dark Series Now comfortably organized among my favorite novels, I can't plug this title enough to friends and family who are fans of romance - paranormal or otherwise. Super hot page turner, it had me giggling within the first naughty (*ooo! naughty!) ten pages, and two days later I'm ready to pick it up again for the long weekend. This is one you hold on to and keep rereading.Thank you Kresley Cole! My tastes run more historical with romance genre rather than preternatural, and after my last fiasco into the category, I was ready to call a major time-out (see my reviews). However, this is as perfect as it gets - a super-charged attraction, endearingly flawed hero and heroine, compelling backdrop. You don't have to wait before it gets going. The tension starts on the first page and doesn't end until the end... ah, wonderful, wonderful cheese!He's the ancient werewolf king (of course, heh) recently escaped from a tortured imprisonment, and she's a recently-spawn half vampire / half valkyrie, but a compassionate wimp - a creature who can't bring herself to harm anything - even to nip enough blood to keep her healthy. Admirable, but worrisome. I've a penchant for the whole 'alpha-male / alpha-female / trouble ensues' and usually slink away from the 'weak, whining female stereotype,' because normally, I just want to slap them, but fragile Emmaline Troy has enough modern-style chutzpah to take on overbearing protagonist Lachlain on her own terms. On the streets of Paris, she's seeking the story of her unique lineage, and when he scents her deep within his horrifying confinement, he draws strength enough to break free in search of his one true mate (ahhh, me). Enter the conflict: vampires, werewolves and valkyrie tribes have been battling for countless centuries... the gods must hate them both. When he abducts her, the journey is a never-want-to-end romp of desperate desire, hilarity, property damage and ooooh, mature sexual content... mmmm mmmm good!Kresley Cole is able to masterfully mix the familiar with her own spawned lore, and throw in a few contemporary references to make you laugh out loud. She adeptly mixes IPods with primeval weaponry and nail polish with ancient customs. It's a smart book, well-written and an absolute keeper. The characterization is fully formed, locations lushly depicted, supporting characters quirky and interesting... and I'm sure I'm not the only one impatiently waiting to see which one stars in her next novel. You'll just love Emmaline's doddering valkyrie aunt Nix, and feel for Lachlain's friend Bowe's misery. Try not to double over in laughter when you learn who Emmaline's mom is. The boyfriend almost made me stop reading for fear I would choke myself with it. Poor guy, he had to sit so patiently when I was compelled to give him a play by play of the plot.Read this book, it's so entertaining. Warning: don't bring this as beach reading, you're likely to forget to turn before you get a serious sunburn. Get all the chores done, find a quiet spot indoors, turn ON the air conditioner and enjoy! Turn ON the air conditioner... the definition of a 'page turner' Kresley Cole is an amazing writer, I have read all of her releases to date. She has created a world and people that I never want to see go. I feel like I know each character, all their quirks, strengths and weaknesses. Love Kresley Cole I will be the first to admit that I am experiencing Twilight Saga withdrawal and was looking for a little Vampire Romance. I am an old school Anne Rice fan from the 90's and hadn't read much in this genre for awhile. Well, this series is no Twilight and is certainly for mature audiences. But, I enjoyed the book. I also think she is a funny writer. Half-way through the book, I looked the author up to see how she looked because her writing was so humorous and contemporary. I am glad I found this series. She definitely has a new fan. Wow, so good. I have read all Kresley Cole`s books and all of them are 5 star reads. Yet this one is absolutely the hottest one. It was a perfect start for the serie. Lachain is an animal. 100% alpha. Emmaline seems fragile & weak compered to him but has an inner strenght matching her mate`s. Simply perfect! Best Of The Best from Kresley Cole! This is the the second book in the series( first book is in an anthology tittled playing easy to get) and one of my favorites. if you like to laugh as much as you like passion and down right steamy sex senes, you will love this book.(as well as the series)a brief desciption of the story..lachlain is a lycke a.k.a werewolf who has been trapped and tortured for over a 100 yrs. when he smells his mate from his dungen, he breaks free to find her. only to realise she is one of his most hated enemies, a vampire.this book is fast paced, funny and very sexy, can't say enough about how much I love this series. I gave this book 5 stars, but I'd give it 10 if I could. a hunger like no other imortals after dark series book 2 It was thrilling and romantic to the end. Can't wait for the next one. suzie10 Witty and interesting characters. I would like to read more from this author. Talented author This book is delicious! This is an addicting tale with all the supernatural creatures of the world.A great battle is in the midst between all the clans of the Lore. Vampires, Lykae (werewolves), witches, ghouls, and Valkyries, are all out to win over the other at all cost. However, Lachlain, the Lykae King escapes from being imprisoned and tortured by the vampires and begins the search of his one true love, the real battle begins when he finds her, Emma, half vampire and half Valkyrie.This is an exhilarating story on the challenges of when love is forbidden and what extremes have to be conquered to get to that happy ending. Delicious, addicting, and exhilarating! I was up until 2am trying to race to the end of this book....to say I was having a good time, is putting it mildly. Go, buy this book, you can thank me later...and you will, thank me, that is.Why are you still here, reading this review..GO BUY THIS BOOK!Were's, vamps, ghouls, demigods, witty banter, a hot guy, what more do you want?? Go, get out of here and spend some money. Delish-delight-defabu! OMG! indeed. I simply cannot get enough of this book! I'm rereading the IAD series, but this is my favorite! I've read it at least twice since I purchased it this last March! Searing passion, awesome characters, action, vampires, Lykeas, sharp wit, humor, and the clear, strong voice of the writer, this is a definate keeper. If you love big, strong, handsome men who want to take you away and ...bite you and make you his forever then BUY THIS BOOK! You will NOT be disappointed! Bitten and Smitten The energy of this novel! It's years after I first read this book and I still sit around thinking of how fun the trailer would be... option this whole series--get Joss and watch the millions roll in! This was the first novel I ever read that had the immediacy and diction of my every day interactions. Ms. Cole has stayed current linguistically speaking, enabling you to more closely relate to her non-human characters-- who seem all-too-human. Her multi-dimensional characterization is just one reason to enjoy these action-packed books. Optioned?! Nevermind the title- I almost didn't bother reading this because it sounded so over the top, but I can't tell you how glad I am I took the chance.This is the first full book in this series. I admit to not having read the short story that actually begins it! Ms. Cole has created a compelling world with many supernatural species and clever ways of bringing about fated romance.Although the romance side of things is somewhat predictable and at times cliche, it is actually more of a comfort than anything else. The characters can be ridiculous and fun and the romance starts of rocky (to say the least). Watching them work through seemingly monumental issues of birthrights, cultural disparities and prejudices is just downright fun. At times, it can feel like a guilty pleasure to read this book- and the ones that come next!In the end, the important thing to know about this book and the ones that follow is that they are very much like chocolate. Sinfully delicious, guilty pleasures. You have to read them! Passion & fun I had a little trouble with the first couple of chapters, the main male character is such a domineering alpha-male *&^% (insert expletive here). Once beyond that, I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed the Valkrye, Weres, and Vamps. If you like paranormal romance, you'll enjoy this one. If you like this one and haven't tried: Charlaine Harris or Kelly Armstrong you should. Don't let the first chapter turn you off After being unable to put down each of the three MacCarrick series books I raced to grab this too. But sadly there are so many things off in this book, I'm absolutely astounded by the rave reviews.Main Characters: Both are unbelievable and borderline cliche. Lachlain is your classic super hottie, powerful, werewolf king (thus making him also extremely wealthy), who is good at everything he does. For bonus \"hot points\" he's also a scottish werewolf because we love it when gravel-voiced men say things like, \"Lass, I doona want you to leave, ken?\" Well OK we do love that but lets keep it for Highlander books or other historicals where its reasonably germane to the plot and not just tacked on for fun. Supposedly he is tortured by the 150 years of pain he suffered at the hands of an evil vampire. Although frankly this barely surfaces other than as a somewhat weak basis for his poor behavior at the beginning of the book.His mate, Emma, is little better. She's a small wafish beauty who is gentle, sweet, and innocent. Although she also seems to prefer to dress an extremely provocative way that seems to go against the \"sweet and innocent\" description (the picture on the cover says it all - read leather S&M; ensemble?). She is supposed to be younger (a mere 70 years) and her only interests prior to traveling to Europe and meeting Lachlain were watching movies, her iPod, and regularly painting her toes. She never comes together as a plausible or interesting character.Mythology: So the main immortals are the vampires, the werewolves, and the valkyrie. They all have some concept of finding the ONE (though they go by different names) which brings out a huge passion and has the men using the word \"MINE\" a lot. Clearly Kresley is setting the stage for a long and lucrative series of romance novels here.However the Valkyrie were particularly frustrating. They are warrior women who live on electricity (instead of food). However they also seem to produce lightning whenever they're upset. Or they poop lightning, I couldn't quite figure out how that worked. They also seem prone to screeching and histrionics. When not screaming they also have a fondness for toenail polish, movies, and making popcorn which they don't eat but like throwing about like a hoard of 12 year old girls. Supposedly they are unearthly gorgeous although it was hard to anchor this fact alongside all the screeching and popcorn throwing.There is an enormous cast of background characters mentioned briefly and they clearly placeholders for future books. Every mention is a mildly annoying distraction - throwing out 1-2 leads for future books is acceptable (Ward heavily leverages this technique) but I felt like this book was planting the seeds for a 20 book series.Romance: As many have mentioned, their first encounter is unsettling in that it is borderline rape. Their next real encounter is when he marks her under the full moon. I think it was supposed to be a lusty romp in the woods but frankly it was too abrupt a turnaround for the innocent virginal girl who wanted nothing to do with him 5 minutes ago and now is rutting in the mud with wild abandon (I think she has like 18 orgasms, I lost count and started skimming at a certain point).JR Ward is flawed but I would recommend over this book. The MacCarrick trilogy is fantastic and I hope to see more from Kresley Cole! Wish it were a hot mess...because then it would be hot JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood \"Lover\" series got me hooked on paranormal romance. I've been on the look-out for anything that is even close to as good. I've tried Nalini Singh's psy-changeling series and although interesting, it's not in the same class as the brotherhood. After reading Cole's first two Immortal After Dark books....the first being the novella in the book Playing Easy to Get and now A Hunger Like No Other, I'm convinced that this series rivals the \"Brotherhood\" in it's intensity and appeal.This is a story about a Lykae king and his half vampire/half Valkyrie mate. Lachlain is the king who was imprisoned and tortured heavily by a vampire. He is in agony, chained to a wall in a fiery furnace like hell when he scents his mate. He amputates his own leg to escape and find her, only to find that she is a vampire...the same kind that imprisoned him and are his sworn enemies.Emma is none to pleased either when she is taken to his home and told that she was his mate. Their journey to Lachlain's home is laced with humor and sexy interactions as both try in vain to fight their growing attraction.I really like this world that Cole introduces us to. It's not difficult to understand like I've found Singh's to be, and I really like all the different aspects of the Lore and how they relate to each other. As in the first book, The Warlord takes a Bride, this book is speckled with fun secondary characters that would make great books of their own.No matter what, \"A Hunger Like No Other\" will remain a favorite. I loved the evolution of this relationship. What begins as disappointment and disillusionment with each other becomes \"oh so much more\" as they realize just how suited they are despite the seemingly unsurmountable odds they face. This is a passionate, sensual, and unique love story.Don't Miss It! Ward's Brotherhood series has some competition! After reading Kresley Cole's novella in \"Playing Easy to Get\", I went directly to the bookstore to buy \"A Hunger Like No Other\". And yeah baby, it is good! (... just the cover is worth the buy all by itself; awesome, isn't it?) If you read the publishers' summary, you know what it's about: Lachlain MacRieve, king of the Lykae, was shackled in Paris' catacombs by the Vampires - mortal enemies of the Lykae - to be burned alive again and again. For 150 years he endures the pain and only when he finally smells his mate does he get the desperate strength to break through the chains. But when he puts his paws on Emmaline however, it's to discover that she's a cursed vampire; as he's still three quarter crazy from the last 150 years, he's much rougher on her than he should. As for Emmaline, half Vampire/half Valkyrie, despite being raised in a Valkyrie coven, she's not tough, and not brave either (her usual response to confrontation is flight). So Lachlain's harsh treatment does not to endear him to her.... despite the way he raises in her a desire she never (literally) felt.This book is Cool (no, the uppercase C is not a mistake) and the world Cole develops, with the intermingling Lore creatures and everything, gleeful; the posturing and reparties between the Valkyries, for example, are terminally hip. As for when Lachlain finally let go of his prejudice... yummy-yum! Also, the way Emmaline finally comes into her own make for good moments - even though it takes her a loooooong time to do it. In fact, and this is the only bad thing I have to say, the way the relationship between Lachlain and Emma goes (take-tow-steps-forward/take-two-steps-back) becomes annoying after a while... Yep, she's good - 3 stars and a half I was into the contemporary romances and didn't realize that the contemporary paranormal romance better. Mrs.Cole captures her readers and brings them into a pleaseruable realm. She has taken the paranormal genre and created her very own legends and lore...filled with ultra entertaining characters.Emmaline is half vampire and half Valkyrie. Trying to find her place in the world. Being different, she feels lonely because there are no other half vampire and half Valkyrie.Lachlain has spent the last hundred and fifty years being tortured by the vampire Demestriu. He is slowly going mad and then...he scents his mate.And his mate happens to be Emmaline.He must battle his hatred for vampires, and welcome his llove for Emmaline.The Capulets and Montegues had nothing on this new 21st century romance of Romeo & Juliet. desirable I put this on my Kindle because I recently got into PR and saw that it had such a high rating from an established author. Big mistake. Should have read the reader reviews more carefully. Make *no* mistake. What happens within the first two chapters of this book is sexual assault. No \"sort of\" or \"almost\" or \"close to\" as suggested by other reviewers. Take it from someone who has worked in the system: what the so-called hero commits is flat-out kidnapping and sexual assault. If that's your thing, proceed. If not, turn away from this one. Shame on you, Ms. Cole. Assault by any other name",

         "Manhunt Cassette",
         "Easy read and would have probably liked it better if I had not just finished the whole Plum series which are WONDERFUL! Good but not as good as the Plums Although I like Janet Evanovich's more recent offerings, her early romance novels are a lot of fun, too. This one is a trifle different, starting out with a savvy city girl who sets out to find a husband in the untamed wilds of Alaska. Although the heroine makes some mistakes in this challenging place that land her in some wacky situations, she manages to use her vice-president-of-a-big-company brains and experience to tame both her environment and marriage-shy man of her dreams. The title and cover were initially a bit off-putting to me, but I'm glad I read it because it is a rather interesting take on the traditional romance. Love in Alaska Another fun book to read from Ms Evanovich. Simple. Easy to read. Enjoyable! I'm sure you'll agree... A fun Read Manhunt was thrilling and educational to read. When I was first introduced to the book, I thought to myself what more can I learn about Lincoln's assassination. To my surprise, the book incorporated the back-stories and people I was unaware about. James L. Swanson successfully tells the story from many different of angles. He swiftly and easily jumps from person to person to give different people's point of views. For example, when the assassination just occurred, he places the reader into four different people's shoes. On many occasions, I find myself needing several minutes to process what is happening. This along with the immense amount of detail the book went into were the most enjoyable part of the book.Swanson often uses pages and pages to describe the smallest things. Like why Booth brought a knife and single shot pistol rather than a revolver. Another part I loved about the book was, Lincoln's assassination took place in the first 100 pages of the book. This was important to me because it kept the book rolling. Even from the first 100 pages, I was able to learn so much more than I had already knew. I was not aware that Booth tried to kidnap the president days before the assassination. Another aspect I loved about the book was how Swanson was able to tell the facts without it sounding like a history textbook. He is able to incorporate the emotions of people making it easier to relate to the charters. This is important to me because I like to place myself in people's shoes and see how I would react. From this book, I have a better understanding of all the players involved as well as Booth.Prior to the book, I had no idea how the U.S. government was able to catch the fugitive. So I was able to learn how he fled Washington and eventually to the location where he died. I will not give anything away but I can assure you it's very exciting. The book also sheds light on some conspiracy theories people have about the assassination. After reading some of the theories, I can conclude that they are not true. Manhunt is a real page turner. To conclude, if you want to know more about this historic incident in American history, Manhunt is the book for you. A review by Peter Jackson Love the Stephanie Plum series, but this was terrible. I usually stick with the worst books no matter what, but I gave up on this one after stomaching 2/3rds of it. She had something, a glimmer of setting, character...but it was cheesy, patronizing, insipid, ridiculous, cliche...icky boring mess. The daffy but determined heroine, the strong, manly man...and in two days of cliches, they realize they love each other. Ugh. This is a book for a thirteen year old girl, except for the abundant soft porn sex. Way different from Plum This was a fun book to read and I laughed outloud. I keep it for times when I need a good laugh so I can reread it again. The young woman gives up a posh city job to go to Alaska where she bought a cabin and store sight unseen. Of course both are in sorry state and her high heels and suits don't really prepare her for a workday in Alaska! Some predictability but the characters are nicely wrought and are off-beat. If you need a smile or a chuckle this is for you. A Fun Read Just started this book. So far it is very entertaining. I like this author and will read more of her books. I like these books because they aren't really long books so if I start and stop I remember the things that are going on. Janet Evanovich This was the first of Janet Evanovich's novels I read, and I fell in love with the author after reading it. Evanovich has a great sense of humor, and has created a quick, fun read with MANHUNT. It entertains as a romantic comedy without the long, drawn out \"scenes of passion\" so well known for romance novels. Instead, it had me smiling, and laughing from beginning to end. Cute, Fun, Romantic This was my first Evanovich book...I was not impressed, but will take other reader's reviews and consider reading other books of hers. It was just too step-by-step, boy meets girl, etc... Predictable If you looking for funny characters entangled in a quirky fast-moving story line, this isn't it! I'm giving up on Janet E. Giving up on Janet E. this book was in the condition described and arrived in a timely fashion. i am satisfied with this purchase. timely delivery",

         "This is a wonderful book! I bought this book for my daughter when she was two years old and she still has this book and she is in her high school years. This book is written in free verse form. And to the critic who commented that the book was \"hard to understand\" well...there is nothing complicated about the storyline. The message is simple and beautiful: love yourself for who you are. Great Book--Great Lesson! When our friend gave us this book I was not thrilled. With the wiggle eyes poking out of the cover I thought it was going to be nothing special, relying wholly on the gimmick of the eyes to carry it through. Boy was I wrong! Not only are the illustrations fantastic throughout, but the rhyming thoughtful words bring this book home. I love the message that shines through to be true to yourself, you can accomplish great things no matter what size you are.We have read this book so many times that the words are engraved in my heart. I have memorized every line and love to read it to the kids. This is a wonderful addition to any child's library and a book your family will treasure.E's Thoughts (9yrs old):I liked this book because its about sea creatures. It's funny when Max eats pizza. I really like that the book rhymes. It's really well written and fun to read. The illustrations are very colorful and cartoonish. I would recommend this book to all kids, boys and girls. Everyone in our family loves to read it and I think your family would too!H's Thoughts (7 yrs old):I like that Max is trying to be big, but instead he gets fat. The googly eyes are cool too. I think Max is weird and cool. I love the pictures and watching Max grow.M's Thoughts (5 yrs old):I really like that there is a snail on every page. I like to search for them. I love Max's seahorse Sam. The pictures are all really cool. Of course, I like the eyeballs too!W's Thoughts (3 yrs old):I like about the oogly eyes. Great Story, Great Rhymes I would give this book five stars, but the wiggly eyes prevent this book from lining up on a bookcase.I disagree with the reviewer that said that the narrative in this book was poor. It's just fine. My two year old son enjoyed it tremendously and it is a fun read aloud. Wild Wiggly Googly Fun",

         "Alwaleed: Businessman, Billionaire, Prince",
         "Really well written. A great insight into the man. Certainly, worth the read. Alwaleed His Royal Highness Prince Al-Waleed is one of today's most extraordinary, important and fascinating muslims.This authorized biography largely projects him as he wishes to be seen. Many may argue that this may be very different from how he sees himself, which may in turn be very different from how he is in reality. Critics may allege that the account is sugarcoated at best, or a 100% manufactured confection at worst.I believe, like the Prince, one must always be precise. Being precise means to abandon extrajudicial opinions and thinking i.e. unsubstantiated opinions based on heresay, speculation, suspicion, innuendo, logical fallacies and ill-intent. This kind of sloppy thinking is unfortunately more widespread in the urbane \"educated\" population (likely to be reading this review) than in the razor-witted yet simple bedouins that accompany His Royal Highness.A principle of Islamic Law states that the burden of proof lies upon the accuser(s). Another Islamic principle is: \"Be hard on yourself and easy on others\".Obviously HRH is not perfect. But How many muslims can boast not having missed a single prayer in 25 years? How many are as disciplined? How many are as punctual? and How many would retain these and other qualities after having a net worth over $20 billion?Ofcourse, being a connected Royal must have helped, but out of the over 5000+ Princes how many are as successful? or half, or a third as successful? Clearly, he did it on his own merit.Fate deals us a hand in everything, whether it be genetics or circumstances, it is up to us to best play that hand. It is all about tapping into potential and maximizing the \"IRR\".I certainly believe the account narrated by Riz Khan puts HRH squarely in the same league as Gates, Buffet etc. To suggest otherwise is sloppy thinking. In fact, in some ways he supersedes them.To me this book indicates, in general, the future of Islam and Muslims since I view the Prince as a symbol of religious belief, tradition, progress, hardwork, fairness and youth.He is just as similiar to the common muslim, as he is dissimiliar.Reading this book was a humbling, inspirational and revelatory experience. (I am not getting paid to write this!)I give the book 4 stars because I feel from a technical perspective the book could have been better written. It is sometimes redundant. A Muslim Visionary",

         "&quot;The Encyclopedia of Women's Travel and Exploration,&quot; by Patricia D. Netzley, packs a lot of information into more than 250 pages. The bulk of the book consists of alphabetically arranged short articles. Also included are a bibliography and index.The entries themselves fall into a number of categories: general subjects (Accommodations, Clothing, Culture Shock, Military Service, etc.); places both general and specific (Africa, Asia, Mount Everest, etc.); important books in the field of women's travel; types of female travelers (Missionaries, Pilgrims, Pirates, Queens, Spies, etc.). There is an assortment of other articles on various interesting subjects (Mountaineering, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the Iditarod Dog Sled Race, etc.).There are also many entries devoted to individual travelers and explorers. It's truly a multicultural and international gathering of women: Clara Barton (a Red Cross leader), Nellie Bly (journalist), Susan Butcher (American dogsledder), Hsi Kai Ching Yih (19th century pirate of China), Jane Goodall (pioneer in chimpanzee research), Zora Neale Hurston (African-American anthropologist and writer), Margery Kempe (religious pilgrim of the Middle Ages), Junko Tabei (Japanese mountaineer), Edith Wharton (American writer), and many, many, more.It is fascinating to read of the lives of these women and learn of the huge diversity of reasons that led them to travel or explore. Netzley incorporates bibliographic references into the entries, so interested individuals have starting points for further reading. The book also includes a wealth of black-and-white photos of various women profiled in the book.

Brings back many fond memories and seems to let the imagination flow freely and to another world, or place and time. A wonderful book. Good read When I was a kid I had all the burroughs books in my collecting in paperback; what a joy it is to have all the books in E-book form. good book It is a great book. A very richly laid out world. I read it to my daughter and she loved it very much. great book This is the sequel toAt the Earth's Core. That book ended with the hero, David Innes, back on the surface world and separated from his mate, Dian the Beautiful. In this book, he returns to Pellucidar to get her back. This is a formula in many Edgar Rice Burroughs books; the hero becomes separated from his lady love, and has a series of adventures until he is reunited with her. It may be a formula, but it's a successful one. Sure, the plots may be similar, but there are always different strange, exotic worlds to encounter. There was a reason ERB was the most popular pulp writer of his time. Fans of pulp fiction will enjoy this book. Lost on Pellucidar",

         "The book is well researched backed by the author's visit to the battlefield site. He interviews numeorus survivors(mostly German) of the battle. It is a pity that the Russians are not more forthcoming in allowing researchers access to their archives.The only negative and I may be the only that thinks in this respect, is that I hate coffee table sized books. Great history Expertly well written and researched - I am very very impressed. Find one and buy it! one of the best history books ever written Excellent book, with loads of anecdotes and personal accounts, at least for the German side. The book would have been even better if the author could have managed to obtain more Soviet first hand accounts as well, but even without them he does a good job of describing and assessing the Soviet side of the battle as well. Outstanding History This book provided me with hours of enjoyable reading and study. Its the rare photo prints and maps that make the battle of the Cherkassy 'kessel' much more realistic. A must read for any Eastern Front enthusiast! Outstanding Eastern Front Battle Archive This book is an exhaustive and detailed study that presents a nearly hour-by-hour accounting of the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket during three hard-fought weeks of January and February 1944. In addition to the facts of the battle, there is a wealth of supporting information regarding the commanders and their backgrounds, tactics, histories of the armies involved, great B&W; photos, maps, and first-hand soldier accounts. The battle itself was a disaster for the Wehrmacht and hastened the fall of the Ukraine. The Soviets sought to create a second Stalingrad (while the pocket contained 65,000 Germans, the Soviets thought it contained twice that number) and very nearly did.The overall description of the battle is very interesting and features ancillary topics such as the Luftwaffe's attempt to supply the soldiers trapped in the pocket. The first-hand accounts from both the German and Russian sides are fascinating to read - the hardships the Landser faced during the ordeal are unimaginable. This book is well worth the price but due to the amount of detail involved, is really best suited for serious students of die Ostfront. Detailed, Fascinating Account of the Cherkassy Pocket",

         "Solid, methodical, broad in reach, and always faithfully Reformed, Berkhof provides a much-needed compendium on Systematic Theology. This work is still used in numerous Seminaries and Bible colleges. In his magnum opus Berkhof stipulates theological truth as he explains all the essential doctrines of the Christian faith. The author confutes the myth that systematic theology is boring and reveals that when it comes to concise organized theological truth, no one outdoes his effort.Great for personal or family devotions! Perfect for Sunday school classes.World named it: \"One of the top 100 books of the millennium.\"With this book-Berkhof presents a readable and precise catalogue of theology that no one should ignore. Almost a 1000 pages and now it comes with a fine introduction. All ministers, seminary students, and even non-clergy should own this outstanding and substantial volume.There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies Standard Reformed ST Compendium I have been reading many systematic theology books and other resources to keep my understanding straight regarding the sound doctrine. This is a serious and challenging task because today's prosperity gospel filled messages from many churches do not teach it properly. Finally, this is the one that I was looking for and by far the best I ever read. It will open your eyes and equip you for deeper understanding of Biblical truths. I strongly recommend it to everyone, especially Bible teachers ! This is a must for all Christians ! I bought my first time systematic theology book in my life.Though it is a used one I am satisfied.God bless you.I recommend another good book to readfor \"knowing\" God more.The Mosaic of Christian BeliefThanks. Hi, how is it going? This Systematic Theology by Berkhof is a gem. Get it. Check it out at the library or purchase it by clicking on that yellow button, or buy it & support a Confessional Reformed Seminary by hopping on to the WestminsterSeminary book store website and buy it (it's probably cheaper there).There are two copies. The Banner of truth will not wear and tear, it's a glued cloth hard back. But the thing is it's missing the classic Richard Muller introduction and a beginning chapter.In my opinion, it would be tough for any systematic theology work to beat this one. Again I say \"in my opinion\" the only systematic theology that would replace this one would have to be a theologian with the same level of scholarship and care as Berkhof. Someone who is Machen-like and Confessionaly Reformed (Three Forms, Westminster Standards).Why say more, the book has enough reviews. I'm just chiming in and giving this ST the five stars that it deserves so that maybe it could improve its overall 4 star status!Inwoo Louis Berkhof's Systematic Theology is a gem. Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem. I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar. This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.Where do I start? First off, the font size is terrible. So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant. Then comes the print type. It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage. The printing is extremely bad. Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy. Was the typeset dirty? Did you run out of ink? True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus. But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers. That is how one presents a text of significance.If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day. Extremely shoddy production of a jewel. Shame on the publisher",

         "The Canine Good Citizen: Every Dog Can Be One (Howell Reference Books)",
         "The techniques in this book are outdated and potentially harmful. Dogs are not wolves, and have not been wolves for many thousands of years. The \"pack leader\" mentality of dog training is foolish, and forcing/holding your dog into positions to prove your dominance is counterproductive bullying at best and downright dangerous at worst. I encourage dog owners to read through/watch Sophia Yin's rebuttal of the dominance method:(...)Letting your dog eat before you sit down to dinner or letting him sleep on your bed is not going to make him aggressive or unruly. Your dog doesn't dart outside ahead of you because he thinks he's the leader... he's just excited to go outside! You don't need to win every game you play with your dog in order to \"prove\" you're better anymore than you'd win every game with your kid to show them that you're in charge- all it's going to do is make them feel crappy (who wants to play a game that they can never win?) I have two dogs that are proof of all of that.Now, true, you don't want to let your dog push you around- no blocking doors, no refusing to give up seats (mine know the command \"scootch,\" though one of them always moves automatically, even when it's not necessary. Even though I let them win games! Shocking!!) But if you have a dog with aggression problems, you have bigger issues than trying to pass the CGC test and you definitely should NOT be physically forcing them to lay down for a half hour! That's a great way to get yourself bitten.I'm sure many of the training techniques in this book work just fine, and dogs are, in general, very forgiving creatures who will let you bully them into submission (even though it's not necessary) because they want to please you. But this book and those like it are out of touch with what psychology knows about behavior. Why be inefficient and mean to your dog when you can make the experience pleasant and rewarding instead? Dangerously outdated I ordered this book and read it extremly fast that I was surprised that I got what I did from it. I entered my dog Princess and she passed!! I expected it to be a lot harder that it was (the actual test). But, best of all I have a very well behaved dog. It was the Volhards book that spurned me on to K9 search and rescue, therapy, skijoring, agility and service dog training, which I train my own dog for. Being 14 that is a lot!! Very good book. I would HIGHLY reccomend. Best book on CGC I just received this book a few days ago, but sat down and skimmed it cover to cover. I realized a few things that we were doing with our 4 month old GSD puppy that we should change. The book was easy to understand. The drawings/images help demonstrate proper techniques. There is a great 8-week training schedule to help get any dog trained and manageable. The book also goes over the elements of how a dog is tested for the Canine Good Citizen test and ways to approach the 10 different elements to prepare him/her for the examination. Additionally, it lets you know what you can or cannot do during the test - such as constant verbal contact with the dog being acceptible and no use of food for motivation. I'm excited to start this training and hopefully get our girl her CGC certification. Easy read, straight-forward, good images = good book! This book is great for training especially for a newbie to dog training. Very easy to understand how to do the basics and work from there. I recommend it highly and so do my two Havanese. Bottom line it is up to you to put in the time needed to reach the goal we have reached. It is well worth it. Book Review I knew I was in trouble when, just after purchasing this book, I found my dog eating it.Wonderful book, can't recommend it highly enough. Solid, loving, step-by-step training manual to work with your dog - not against them. Easy to understand instructions for teaching your dog to be a welcome presence in any situation. I recommend this book for those who are novice in training their dog, first time owners, and those who have been training for years and years. And so tasty too!",

         "I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was thin, action almost nonexistent--not much to it. Definitely not your typical, entertaining Robert B. Parker book. Night and Day Let's face facts -- this is not a great book. The central mystery is pretty toothless, and there are a pair of subplots (one involving a principal and another the ever-lovin' Jenn) that don't have much bite either. Even the good guys are universally, sniggeringly sex-obsessed -- Jesse can't seem to have a conversation with Molly that doesn't include a reference to her one-night stand -- which makes their investigating sex crimes a bit disturbing. And Jesse does a thing or two in the line of police work that cannot be legal.On the other hand, Parker is suddenly gone. Which means that our times with Jesse, Suit, Molly and Sunny and Spike (who visit from one of Parker's other series) is now suddenly limited. So I found myself savoring the denizens of Paradise more than I would have under other circumstances.It's below average Parker, but below average Parker is better than no Parker at all. And that makes me sad. Easy to read, hard to review I like to read a Robert Parker novel whenever I want a book that is fast and simple to read. The characters are familiar, dialogue moves the action, and you can be distracted externally, and pick up where you leave off with ease. His books are ideal for travel: like snack food. The eighth police chief Jesse Stone novel, Night and Day, focuses on the theme of obsession. Readers know that Jesse remains obsessed with his ex-wife Jenn. After a peeping Tom in the town of Paradise increases his obsession and progresses to home invasion, molestation and then murder, Stone and his police team work to track him down. Along the lines of \"it takes one to know one,\" Stone examines the obsessive Night Hawk, as they call him, from the perspective of Stone's own obsession with Jenn. Sunny Randall and Spike make cameo appearances, as does Spenser's Susan Silverman. The pace of the novel is as quick as ever, and the dialogue is peppery. Before you know it, you'll have finished the book, the flight attendant will be announcing imminent landing, and you'll be somewhat satisfied that you didn't totally waste a boring flight doing nothing.Rating: Three-star (Recommended) Obsession LOVED IT!I love all the books in the Jesse Stone Series.This one is no exception.I just love Jesse ... Plain and Simple.I picture him as Tom Selleck while reading and I am gone.Can't wait for the new Jesse Stone movie on CBS Sunday March 1st. JESSE is BACK! Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job.. Robert Parker Night and Day Katherine Hilbery has everything - she is beautiful, well-born, intelligent, kind, reflective, sensitive, though not in a sentimental way, but... bored. She must find a purpose in life, other than being of a wealthy Chelsea family and the descendant of a famous poet, and she must choose between the weak-willed sophisticate William and the tempestuous Ralph. Though the love of the self-sacrificing suffragette Mary Datchet for Ralph and the upcoming law-clerk's failure to realise he is in thrall to Katherine provide a few twists and turns, such is in essence the plot of Night and Day.All would be well if this were the psychological drama it appears to be, set in an atmospheric turn-of-the-century London. But Virginia Woolf also pursues a political message: in this novel, women answer to male stereotypes and vice versa. The women are logical and career-minded, the men coy and romantic. This might be fine, and it makes for a few good scenes, except that it doesn't quite fit the characters. Mary's ill-starred fate seems gratuitous. Katherine's interest in mathematics is too obviously a code, never properly illustrated. And her falling in love with Ralph isn't credible - she is too good for him, and it is all too sudden. It seems Night and Day can't quite choose what it is supposed to be: psychological or social comedy. It lacks the simplicity of Woolf's first novel The Voyage Out, the wistfulness of Mrs Dalloway, or the experimental complexity of her later works. Woolf's flawed second novel I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone novels; not this one! It was the usual Jesse and his Ex talking in circles around a peccadillo: a peeping Tom! Even in Paradise, I am sure something more interesting could happen! I will wait for the paper back next time Parker comes out with a new one. This deserves less than one star! Sinking Stone A delightful edition of a masterpiece! Woolf was a profound writer and she stories are deep and complex. She wrote about the feelings that most of us have experienced at one time or another. This is why her work is considered by so many of her readers as something very special. Understood by women everywhere and a book that women should read at least once, its also a good book for men to read, to help understand women.To understand love, read Night and Day.Profound! You will want to read this Night and Day! Virginia Stephens Woolf (1882-1941) was born to Sir Leslie Stephens and his second wife. His first wife was one of William Makepeace Thackery's daughters. Woolf had brothers and a sister Vanessa. She was a shy, brilliant intellectual who committed suicide in 1941. She is the best known member of the Bloomsbury Group of authors/painters/poets and intellectuals who met at her home. Among this group are: Edward Morgan Forster; T.S. Eliot: Carrington; Lytton Strachey; Vanessa and Clive Bell; Duncan Grant and Virginia's husband Leonard Woolf.Virginia Woolf's first novel was \"The Voyage Out.\" She wrote diaries throughout her life as well as criticism. Woolf also spent time teaching literature to the poor. Virgnia was a liberal who had a lesbian relationship with Vita Sackville-West. She had no children.Night and Day was the second novel by young Virginia. It was published in 1919 after the author had spent several years writing it. Woolf had long periods of time when she grappled with mental health problems spending days in bed. She was carefully attended to by her husband Leonard.The Plot: The long novel deals with the love life of Katharine Hilbery and her friend Mary Datchet. The two women are very dissimilar. Katharine comes from a literary family much like the one in which Woolf grew up. Katharine is torn between love for Ralph Denham and William Rodney. Both men are attorneys. One of Katharine's relatives named Cassandra Otway also is in love with William Rodney leading to a messy triangle. Mary Datchett is attracted to Denham. She is a worker in the Women's suffrage cause in England. In the end all the love problems are resolved.The novel is rich in the use of bird imagery to describe the emotions felt by the characters. Night is symbolic of the dreamy world often inhabited by young Katharine and her Ralph Denham who holds an idealistic dream of love. Day refers to the everyday world of London life.Though the book has its boring parts it is, nevertheless, an Edwardian novel which shows the promise of a young writer who fulfilled her potential in such better books as \"Mrs Dalloway\"; \"The Waves\"; \"Orlando\" and \"To the Lighthouse.\" These later books make much more use of stream of consciousness and indirect communication among the characters.The book may be dull to many but Woolf's beautiful writing in which she describes London and the feelings of her leading characters makes this a novel of interest. A neglected gem by a great author! Night and Day is a little known but well written classic by Virginia Woolf Another entertaining book from the hand of Robert Parker. He just keeps doing it. Parker does it again ZERO STARS. Everyone has read the complaints about Parker's latest works - double spacing, large fonts, one third pages, etc. Until you try one his books on audio, you do not know how bad it has gotten. I bought this book on CD's for a recent trip. I know the books had gotten shorter but you can't hide that in audio - the unabridged edition is a total of 5 discs with a spacer taking up half the box to make the box look normal size for a novel.On top of that, if you eliminated the amateur technique, you would remove 40% more of the book. Almost every line ends with \"name said\" - as in \"What do you think?\", Jesse said. \"I don't know.\", Molly said. When reading the books, your eyes can easily skip over this. When listening to it on audio, there is no way to tune it out. After less than half a disc, I have had to stop. Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Parker - I own every book he has published - but this may be the last. ROBERT B. PARKER - make an effort or hang it up - this is embarrassing. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Juvenile technique shows in audio Robert Parker's final Jesse Stone novel reflects the authors declining health before his death. Parker seems to be going through the motions. The dialogue remains witty and snappy but there is not much else. It appears that Parker was rushing to complete this novel before his death. You can skim read this in an hour or two.The plot revolves around a peeping Tom who is stalking women in Paradise plus sending notes to Police Chief Jesse Stone, saying he is going to take his obsession to the next level. Parker fans will enjoy but also will be disappointed. Unfortunately, this is the final book in the series but not the greatest. Latest But Not Greatest I think I've probably read everything written by Robert B. Parker. I like his pacing, his characters, his dialogue and his plots. He creates worlds of black and white and periodically it satisfies me to inhabit these worlds. I love how the mysteries unfold themselves and his ability to embrace morality without seeming cheesey. Once again, this novel made me a very happy reader.The plot for this Jesse Stone novel is easily relatable. No big time crime lords here, the story centers on quiet desperation and crossing boundaries. As always, the reader gets to witness Jesse's struggle with alcohol and women but this time, he seems to be making progress on all fronts.Robert B. Parker is in my top 5 of favorite authors and I'm already looking forward to his next novel. Fingers crossed that Private Detective Sunny Randall will be the focus of his next published effort. Old Reliable Parker Does It Again How can anyone not enjoy Jesse, Suit & Molly - every book is a delight. Love Jesse's humor and outlook on life - drinker or not! Jesse Stone does it again! After the rather awfulStranger In Paradise (Jesse Stone)I was afraid the whole series was going to just fizzle.I was pleasantly surprised with \"Night and Day\". It is a return to higher standard of reading to which I had grown accustomed. The plot moves along nicely, the witty banter is plentiful. The case is distressing but not super-hero level.I will not go into all of the plot details. Those are outlined by others on the page. All in all, this is a pleasant and quick read. Everything I look for in a Parker novel - detecting, banter, psychobabble and a bit of romance (in a macho sort of way, of course). Jesse Stone returns to form Before I jump into my review of Robert B. Parker's newest \"Jesse Stone\" novel, Night and Day, allow me to first to give a big plug for the five TV movies based on the series that Tom Selleck has produced and starred in, the most recent being Thin Ice, which was aired by CBS on Sunday, March 1st. Selleck captures the role of Jesse Stone perfectly, and each movie is a slow burn, filled with excellence on every level. If you're a fan of the novels, then you owe it to yourself to see the TV movies. Except for Thin Ice, the other four (Stone Cold, Night Passage, Death in Paradise, and Sea Change) are out on DVD. Also, CBS tends to broadcast a \"Jesse Stone\" movie every so often, so keep an eye out.Now, on to Night and Day, which is the eighth novel in the \"Jesse Stone\" series. Like the seven previous books, the small-town chief of police has to deal with three cases simultaneously, which keeps the story line moving along at a brisk pace and the reader from being bored. I probably should mention that while Jesse's attempting to solve his three cases, he's also battling his obsession with his ex-wife, Jenn, and with alcoholism, both of which are tied closely together.This time around, Jesse has to deal with a rather unusual situation that involves a female high-school principal and a panty check of the young girls going to the school dance on one particular night. The principal claims that she was only doing it to make sure the girls intended to be good and not naughty by wearing thongs and other sexy lingerie underneath their skirts. The parents of the children, however, are outraged over the act and want Jesse to do something about it. He pretty much agrees with the parents and thinks that it's definitely an invasion of privacy, but it doesn't help matters that the principal just happens to be married to the head of Boston's top law firm. Along with that problem, Jesse has to deal with a voyeur who calls himself the Night Hawk and likes to look into the windows of women as they're undressing at night. His antics soon escalate into daytime breaking & entering, not to mention home invasion, and Jesse's worried that someone may eventually get hurt during the commission of the crime. Last, but not least, a young girl approaches Jesse to complain about her swinging parents and how it's hurting the family. Jesse doesn't have a problem with consenting adults swinging, if that's what they want to do, but when children are experiencing the negative side effects in this type of behavior, he feels the need to step in and do something about it before more emotional damage is caused.The story line and pacing of Night and Day are similar to the other books in the series, and the reader doesn't really encounter anything new here. The fun of the books, however, is in getting to visit with Jesse Stone for a few hours and to see how he's doing and to find out what's happening in Paradise, Massachusetts. The reader knows going into the story that Jesse will solve the crimes in one fashion or another, but it's Jesse himself that's the big attraction. He a good man, a tough man when necessary, but he still has problems like everybody else. As a reader and fan, I want to know how's he coping with his alcoholism and with the addiction to his ex-wife. Actually, I want to see him happy and at peace with himself, which leads to one very good thing about this particular novel--private investigator Sunny Randall is back (she and Jesse decide to give it another shot), plus her best friend, Spike, is opening a new restaurant in Paradise.As with most of Mr. Parker's books, Night and Day is well written with sharp, crisp dialogue that makes the reader want to try out some of the lines at work. And, like the TV movies, the novels basically follow the saga of Jesse Stone's life to see where he's at and how he's dealing with the day-to-day challenges. I think most readers can identify with the chief of police on many levels, be it problems with the person you love, or the need to drink in order to escape the stress of everyday life.Robert B. Parker's novels are always a delight to read and certainly entertaining in every sense of the word. Night and Day is no exception, and is a wonderful addition to an already marvelous series. I'll also add that older readers tend to enjoy Jesse Stone somewhat more than the younger ones, but Robert B. Parker does have a large fan base of all ages. Coming in May, the third novel in the \"Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch\" western series. Yeeeeehaaaa! Another winner in the \"Jesse Stone\" series!",

         "The Center of Everything : A Novel",
         "I am always looking for a good book to read, and I very rarely find one worth finishing. This book was quite the opposite; I wished it had gone on longer. It is a great book and I wish I heard about it more often, it deserves to be a best-seller. Excellent read This book was wonderful. I could feel the humid air and smell the lilacs with drops of water leftover, after a rainfall. I love the way Evelyn's thoughts are so black and white. It is or it isn't. I can't wait for another great story from Moriarty. You can smell the lilacs... Personally, I see little to compare between Laura Moriarty's The Center of Everything and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Both are fine books but Mockingbird centers on racism in the south years before the Civil Rights movement and this book is, in my opinion, a true coming of age novel.The protagonist, Evelyn Bucknow , was born out of wedlock to a mother who does her best for her daughter until depression overtakes her when she finds herself without a job and pregnant, but unmarried, a second time. Moriarty writes with such insight that you can't help but feel the child's pain, as well as the depths of the mother's despair. In fact, you can't help but feel FOR the mother even though her actions are responsible for their endless poverty. Because of an out-of-wedlock, teen pregnancy, the path was set--a path that young Evelyn has no choice but to live and survive.I hope I haven't led you to believe Evelyn's story is depressing because it isn't. Young Evelyn is smart! She is a thinker! I recommend the book to all ages but, especially to young readers, as it has a message that is straight and true: A single mistake can change your life, so use your head and learn from others. Outstanding! I liked the story and how the point of view of the narrator evolves as she grows and matures. The ending was a little drab, though. I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the characters futures. A good book but not too great of an ending I read this book in 2 days and loved every bit of it. It's definitely a must read!! I highly recommended this book to anyone. Awesome The book rec's was in good condition. Enjoyable....but I prefer non-fiction. Recommended to me by a friend. The Center of Everything Everyone is saying this has the distinct voice of To Kill a Mockingbird and it really is very similar. The story is not really like Mockingbird but the narrative perspective is told in the same way by Evelyn Bucknow. The book covers eight years of Evelyn's adolescence--from 10 years onto her graduation from high school. Her mother is constantly trying to make ends meet financially, and she loves Evelyn deeply. There is a great schism in the family because Tina, Evelyn's mother, had her out of wedlock. Tina's parents are extreme fundamentalists that will not let her forget her past. When Tina becomes pregnant again with a married man's baby, the problems start all over again, and Evelyn's grandmother, Eileen, is the only family that will talk to them.Evelyn's brother, Samuel, is born prematurely and it is soon obvious that he is mentally handicapped. Tina's role in the book changes to constant caretaker of Samuel, and Evelyn moves into her teenage years nearly alone. Her grandmother begins taking her to church, and Evelyn finds some answers there... yet she struggles with questions when one of her favorite teachers in school, Ms. Jenkins, becomes the target of a smear campaign by the fundamentalists for teaching evolution to the children. Evelyn's struggle to decide whether to side with her grandmother and the \"nice people at the church\" or her teacher shows exactly how Evelyn is certainly in the center of everything.The Center of Everything brings together many situations that Evelyn must confront--and she is a strong girl who has a very wise voice for someone so young. Evelyn as the center of everything... I wanted to love this book. I really did. It flows nicely and I connected with the characters. I found myself really caring about what happened to them, and I even teared up a time or two. The problem? NOTHING ever happened to them. I kept reading and reading, thinking something big was about to drop, and then it was just more-- nothing. There were a couple times in which it seemed like something might be about to happen, but nope. It's just a story about any old girl from nowhere, USA, who doesn't quite fit in and doesn't know quite who she is; most of us lived that, so why would we want to read it? Plus I HATED the ending. I get that the story will be continued in future books, but I'm not interested enough to spend the time and money to read any more. A Well-Written Story About Nothing I usually avoid books featuring child narrators like the plague, but when I recently picked up The Center of Everything, the writing was so winsome and Evelyn and her mother's precarious situation so compelling that I kept reading. And I'm so glad I did, because I got a lot more than I bargained for: The Center of Everything is a novel that I actively looked forward to returning to every night so I could see what the characters were up to, and toward the end I rationed out the pages so I could stay in Moriarty's Kerrville, Kansas a while longer. The character of Tina is a particular triumph; Moriarty gives her wit and warmth and shatters preconceptions about welfare mothers while remaining true to situation. Wise and compassionate and laugh-aloud funny, The Center of Everything is a book to be treasured and reread. Wonderful novel. sad not to be in Kerrville, Kansas anymore The Center of Everything is one of those rare coming of age novels full of emotional pathos and personal growth that somehow touches a deep nerve within, especially if you were about the same age in the Reagan era 80's as protagonist Evelyn Bucknow. It is a novel about a smart girl living in a small Kansas town with her overwhelmingly depressed, trampy \"welfare queen\" mother searching for a better path in life than the path her mother chose. Told from Evelyn's perspective between the ages of 10 through 18, the first half of the novel focuses on her increasingly strained relationship with her somewhat unattentive mother. When Evelyn reaches the breaking point with her mother and \"a black line\" is drawn between them, the novel then focuses on Evelyn's fractured friendships, painfully unrequited love and her desire to improve the quality of her life. Moriarty's prose is thoughtful and breezy with a touch of child-like innocence. The characters are achingly real keeping you riveted to the page not from suspense but from a desire to get to know them better. You'll find your emotions run high as you love/hate many of the characters, especially Evelyn's mother. Touching and poignant, sad but never sappy The Center of Everything is a believable account of a girl's search for herself and her place in the world. emotionally riveting This book ends with Evelyn standing on the porch with her special needs brother and a storm is approaching. What's that all about? Not worth the read...Very disappointed.. Ineresting Ending Everlyn Bucknow is a little girl with very little stability, but more than enough spunk to cope with her very roller coaster life. This book touched me very deeply. The terror of living so close to the edge of total poverty, that a mechanical problem with a car turns your entire world upside down. The unbelievable importance of caring and noticing teachers who can inspire a dream of a different way of life in a child. Send the kids to Grandmas for the weekend and lose yourself in this well written and inspiring book. Very Touching While interesting, the story was a bit predictable and I found it to be depressing at times. Would appeal to teens. Predictable It did keep my attention; However, very depressing and it just abruptly ended. I liked the main character, Evelyn. Would not have compared it to, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;. Depressing My two year old daughter accidentally bought this book and I think it is one of the best accident to happen as of late. Awesome Is there a sequel? The book was written well but at the end there was so much that was left hanging. The center of everything I very much enjoyed this book. It is a good indication of how someone that is born into poverty and faces many challenges is able to rise above it by the life choices she makes.I also had admiration for Tina, the mother. Her life choices were not good, but, she possessed a fierce love for her children.I especially admired the work she put in with her handicapped son.I would have given it five stars, but, the ending left me wanting more. Hopefully, a sequel will be written. The Center of Everything So, if you like your books to leave you depressed, this is a great one for you. The story follows Evelyn, the daughter of an unwed mother, from fourth grade until it stops without any apparent reason just prior to her graduation from high school. The ending makes no sense - it literally just stops without warning.The author has a good grasp on writing, which is why I have given her two stars instead of the one star the book probably deserved. The author dwells only on the negative and doesn't give us any glimpse of a good thing that might have happened to Evelyn during the eight years. Death, autism, teenage pregnancy, adultery, blah, blah, blah. Evelyn rises above it but without giving us any idea how she does so.Along the journey, the author snipes at conservative politics, Reagan, Oliver North, Christianity, and any other sort of morality. Hysterically, the author dwells on Iran Contra as if it consumed thought for eight years when reality is that it was a blip on the political scene that lasted only a short time. Strange and rather boring to read about in 2011. The only interesting thing I noted from this was that while the author was trying to beat Christianity to pieces, the only truly nice people in Evelyn's life, the ones that gave without expectation of any return, were the Christians.Apart from the author's political agenda and liberal ideology slapping you across the head over and over again, the abrupt ending is a horrible disservice to a reader who waded through the morass of it all, only to be stopped without satisfaction. Because of the ending, I cannot recommend the book. Unrelentingly Depressing I am so glad I finally read this book. I've had it laying around for the past couple years and never gave it much thought, but it turned out to be an excellent read.This is the story of Evelyn Bucknow. She lives in Kerrville, Kansas with her young mother and no father. We meet her at age 11 and follow her to her last year in high school. In that time she experiences her first love, and first heartache...the feeling of being an outsider, and the betrayal of her one true friend. She learns that young people do not in fact live forever, and she slowly realizes what she wants out of life, and how to acheive it.I highly recommend this book. Evelyn has such a voice for being so young, and her struggles through adolescence are at times both heartbreaking and joyous. I would really love to see a sequal to this book, to learn how Evelyn, her mother, her mentally retarded brother Samuel, and her beloved grandmother Eileen turn out. This was a great book, and I absolutely look forward to reading her future novels. Great Coming of Age Story... A good book for teenagers if they can see that one's actions determine one's consequences and that this isn't just another story. Evelyn's mother has made poor choices all her life, but even in her poor choices, she's found good. One good was Evelyn, the other was her handicapped child Samuel, the result of another poor choice. But Samuel may also be what saves the mother and leads her to begin to make good choices. Evelyn's grandfather made a very poor choice when he chose to label his daughter (Evelyn's mother) with harsh words, to be a poor father, and in essence turn his back on his child. His choice led Evelyn's mother to make the choices she made. One wonders what choices someone before him made which led to the choices he made. (He was not only an awful father, but an awful husband.) \"What happened to Eileen's mouth?\" Evelyn asked her mother. \"She married my father,\" her mother answers. I loved it when Evelyn's teacher planted that seed in Evelyn's head about choices. When the book ends we know, even though it's not stated and the book just sort of ends, that Evelyn will live her life better that her mother and the difference will be in her awareness of the consequences, both for good and for bad, in making choices. The Consequence of Choice I'd love to have a cup of coffee with the author, and compare notes on mothers. This book really touched me, and it's rare to find a book that can make me laugh as hard as it makes me cry. She has a wicked, clever style of narrative that kept me hooked the entire time. I'd love to have coffee with Laura M. I enjoyed getting to know these characters. Evelyn was a complex character with many of the same feelings and questions of most teenage girls. I loved being inside her thoughts and emotions then getting to understand her reasoning and thought process. I was disappointed that the book came to an end. I wish there was a sequel so I would know how they ended up. It was a little too abrupt of an ending. I also enjoyed going back to the 80's and reliving some of my teenage years. Uniquely written novel I enjoyed this book a great deal, although others I loaned it to, found it a tad depressing. It is during the same period of time I grew up, the 80's, but in a small rural town. It is a story of a flower growing out of weeds, a young girl growing up with a single mom whom makes bad choices but is still likable and kind. Very nice touching book. 80's Reagon Era Childhood Book I enjoyed this book, especially since I got it at such a bargain price. The character of Evelyn is very real, very familiar to anyone who was ever a teenage girl. I held back on the fifth star because of my confusion about her mother (is she crazy, is just selfish?) but the mother evolves as well, just as life does. The situations involving young love and broken hearts resonated as very true. I will read another book by this author for sure! I must comment that I love a marked down price in order to get familiar with an author! I think it is a marketing tool that is a win win! Satisfying read - most of the time This is a coming of age story about Evelyn, a young girl with a single mother. They live in Kansas and Evelyn is a lonely and bored young girl. The character development was interesting but the plot was not. I found it slow and very drawn out. It was the kind of book that I couldn't wait to finish and at the end it was a disapointment. Coming of age story that falls flat I bought this book because it looked fun and it was free. It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it. I don't even know why I finished this book... I thoroughly enjoyed this book, laughing out loud at times. Being a mother of girls and also a daughter myself, I could relate to both Evelyn and her mother. As the reader I found myself rooting for Evelyn and her mother..each likeable characters in their own way. The book covers the mother/daughter relationship from Eveyln as a preadolescent who adores her mom through the alienation and breaking away of the teenage years to a time just before Evelyn leaves for college and has gainedc respect and appreciation for her mother. I especially enjoyed the fact that this book held my interest without violence, excessive profanity or dark and depressing themes. A Fun Read Loved this snapshot of growing up in the 80's. The characters are all either judging or being judged as they deal with the consequences of their actions. Some scenarios are hilarious when viewed from Evelyn's perspective. Even better on the second read. Captivating I loved the writer's style, and thought she captured the personality of the main character and the thoughts, feelings, and nuances of her life at each age throughout the story.Religion was a strong thread throughout and while I would have been okay with that as an underlying issue, it was a bit too strong of a secondary storyline for my tastes. I found myself wanting to skim through some of those parts to get back to the \"good stuff.\"Overall, enjoyed the book. Great \"voice,\" a little too much religion for my taste",

         "The Description & Setting volume for the Write Great Fiction series might not be the last word on these subjects, or the one book that has it all, but it provides a good overview and plenty of material for further reflection. Well worth the purchase price. WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE Like the other \"Write Great Fiction\" books, this one focuses on the elements listed on the title, description and setting. While the criticisms some others have had are sound, this is by no means a terrible book, and certainly it is not as awful as some would make it out to be. As for the criticism that there is \"nothing new\" in the book, that's easy. The author makes the assumption (as he should, seeing as how every other good author who has ever written a non-fiction work on any given subject would do the same) that the reader knows nothing, or little about how to write descriptive passages but wants to know more, so having \"no new information\" is an empty criticism. He isn't writing his book for people who already know the concepts, he is writing for those who don't know but want to learn them. The \"nothing is new\" criticism is like a math teacher being critical towards a new math book that comes out since it offers \"nothing new.\" Obviously the math teacher already knows the concepts that are covered in the math book.But I have spent more than enough time on that. This book will teach you how to describe aspects the reader can see, hear, feel, touch and smell, thus bringing them into the story. It will teach you how little description is too little, and how much is too much. It will teach you how to get the reader to paint a mental picture of the world you create in your story. It will teach you how to apply the other aspects of writing fiction, such as plot, dialogue and character development and how they relate to description. It will teach you how to create a single sentence that is chock full of information that the reader needs to know to understand the context of your story. That is what the author intended, that is what he does, and that is why this book is worth the money. Good book This is a practical and useful reference. Using examples from excellent writers, providing good tips for new approaches, it also gives exercises to develop techniques that make for better writing, authentic writing, more enjoyable writing. Handy for every writer's bookshelf I'm glad I bought this book. I definitely use it as a reference. I wish I'd bought it when I first started writing. Very good reference",

         "I was not sure I would like this book, even after seeing the high reviews it received. I finally gave it a shot, and my only disappointment was that I waited so long to read it. I LOVED it, and finished the book in 3 days. I really liked the characters and various writing styles thoughout the book. It's a beautiful story and I hope it becomes a film one day soon! Loved this book Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature. Disappointing This was a pretty nice read. I really enjoyed the story line. If you are a romance enthusiast you will probably like this one. Pretty Good Read This is the first historical Christian romance I've ever read, and I absolutely loved it. Deeanne Gist is going to be a star, mark my words. Witty and charming, this is a story you won't forget. Lady Constance Morrow and Drew O'Connor are wonderful characters and before the book is over, you feel as if you've known them forever. Bravo, Deeanne, and thanks for a great read! Sparkling debut This book is awesome. I can't read it enough. The fact that they were forced to marry is just necessary for the story line, but the fact that they have some of the normal problems of a couple. Their reasons for these issues is that they won't communicate, & that they do it because they love each other. NEED TO READ MORE AGAIN & AGAIN I truely enjoyed this book. I found myself crying at times and laughing out loud at others. I really enjoyed the historic realness. This is not an easy book to put down and walk away from. Intreging, captivating, hard to put down. I do not like to read and I loved this book. Sometimes I had a hard time putting it down. It was clean, fun, and kept my interest. I am already on another book by that author. A Bride Most Begrudging I really enjoyed this book! Although it does carry a religious message, (probably because of the nature of this time period), I think it portrayed the struggles of the new American colonists very well. I liked way the romance fits in historically. I especially liked Constance as a character. I found the ending very abrupt. Awesome historical romance novel I picked this up, not knowing it was a Christian historical romance, but was not sure I'd enjoy it after reading some of the reviews here. I was pleasantly surprised, even though I knew how it would end well before the end.Constance is brought to Virginia after being kidnapped on the docks, and is sold to Drew, a planter who has lost his true love and wants nothing to do with the fiery Constance. When they are married to protect the morals of the area, it's in name only and Drew promises to help her get back to England, if her story checks out. As the book progresses, the couple has to figure out if their initial dislike can turn to attraction and maybe love.My biggest issue with this is that it's a story that's been done before. There aren't any twists to the story, nothing radical, it's just a pleasant reading experience. There isn't any sex; some of the prior reviews mention how much they lust after each other, and I kept waiting to see how \"scandalous\" the relationship would get, and there was barely any mention of them making love. But I just read \"50 Shades of Grey\" and maybe I'm sexed out, because I didn't mind the lack of racy dialogue in this book.It would be nice if the author would consider going back to revisit the characters in a future book. Josh, Drew's brother, was an interesting character, worthy of his own storyline, and their sisters, Nellie and Sally, would make for fun reads. Otherwise, this is a nice book to read to pass the time. Pleasant if predictable I didn't understand all of the rave reviews of this book. I found it to be very boring in places and drawn out. I understand that the author was trying to do all possible to make this book true to the time period she was writing about, however, much of the time the dialogue between the characters was hard to read..I didn't understand the reviews either that some were saying there was a lot of lust and offensive things in this book. There was nothing out of place in my opinion.I didn't hate this book, but I didn't overly enjoy it either. I would have quit reading it half way through if I didn't have to always finish what I start. If I would have just got this from the library, I would have deff quit reading it in the middle. Won't Read This One Again A very engaging story . . . I was most surprised due to the fact that this was not my favorite type/catagory of book but I was not able to put it down. Gist is an outstanding author who has created a real page turner. She does not drag it out but tugs at your heart til you find your eyes flying over the pages to see what happens next! I absolutely loved the personalities and the way she leads you through their own personal spiritual struggles and victories.... this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!! It will touch your heart and you won't be able to put it down!!!!!! I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end. A Christy winner? Really?????? American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century. America the soon-to-be Taken from her home in England against her will, Lady Constance Morrow is shipped to America, where she is to be sold to a Virginia colony farmer as a 'tobacco bride'. The daughter of an Earl, Constance is appalled by her humiliating circumstances. By an odd twist of fate, she ends up becoming the wife of Drew O'Conner, who had never intended to marry at all.Her position as a colony farmer's wife is very different from the life Constance had previously led. To Drew's increasing frustration, she has no skill with cooking and cleaning, and would rather solve mathematical equations than work. Tempers flare between both parties as they adjust to their new lifestyles. Nevertheless, though she began as a bride most begrudging, both Drew and Constance find their marriage of convenience turning into something more than either expected... She started as a bride 'most begrudging'... Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love. Superficial christian message. I will not be reading anymore of her books. I agree with another reviewer this is soft \"christian porn\". TMI I read the reviews before I bought this book, and I was waiting for this terrible \"lust\" to start...I didn't get it. First of all, they were married, and secondly they were married!! I don't think there is anything wrong with a man and woman being attracted to one another, especially if they are married!I never even figured out what these ladies were talking about, all I saw was an attraction, and not lust. Someone said that the characters just lusted after one another, and that there was no love...I think that the author showed the love grow...just like any marriage that starts off like theirs did, you will never have instant love, love is something that takes time. Physical attraction on the other hand can happen much sooner, which is what the author demonstrated.I really liked the book, it was easy to read. Someone else pointed out the historical inaccuracies, well that may be so, but I still enjoyed the book. I love the friction between the two main characters, it makes for an exciting and sometimes funny read! Good read! A true romance with out graphic sex! So cool. I thought it a wonderful story and fell in love with the characters! I liked the Christian over tones as well. I loved it and read it in two days. A lot cheesy at first..over all a great story!",

         "Manic Magee Diesel Hayes#8Manic Magee AKA: Jeffery Magee is a boy who lost his parents at age three years old. They died in a train crash. He ran away when he was only 7 years old. He went to live with his aunt and uncle but they always argued a lot. He wanted to live by himself but he was in the West End were the white kids were . All he wanted was to fit in with the black kids but he didn't have anyone to live with. So he made a new friend that provided a roof over his head.THE END Manic Magee Jerry Spinelli breaks down the stereotypes of what a \"traditional\" family should be in his novel Maniac Magee. Jeffrey Magee, (known as Maniac for some outlandish feats he performs) a strong-willed boy, uses his ingenuity to overcome adversity and find himself a home.Maniac is orphaned at three and moves in with his aunt and uncle who hate each other. Subsequently, they don't even talk to one another. After eight years of this non-existence, Maniac runs away from home. Maniac literally runs in search of a home. He becomes part of several families that he meets in the town of Two Mills. Suzanne Bunker says, \"We are not the Cleavers, we have single-families; step-families; adoptive and foster families; children raised by grandparents, aunts and uncles; gay and lesbian families; and individuals of all ages living together, unrelated biologically but still a family\" (116). The latter mirrors the situations in which Maniac finds himself. The first family with whom Maniac lives is the Beales. They are an African-American family living in the East End of Two Mills. They are a `traditional' family (mom, dad, big sister Amanda, little sister Hester and little brother Lester), and they welcome him into this family with open arms; his skin color is of no significance to the Beales. On his first night there, Maniac checks the front door of the house:number 728.Maniac has a home. He is part of a family. He loves the Beales and the East End and all the colors of the East End. \"He couldn't understand why they called themselves black ...he saw gingersnap and light fudge and dark fudge and acorn and butter rum and cinnamon and burnt orange. But they were never licorice which to him was real black\" (Spinelli 51). Unfortunately, because of his white skin, not everyone loves Maniac in the East End. Maniac feels that he has to leave his beloved Beales to protect them. He runs until he meets Grayson, a caretaker at the zoo. Grayson, an older man, takes Maniac in and gives him a home. As Suzanne Bunkers comments, this mirrors a grandparent raising the child (116). At Thanksgiving, Maniac prays, \"thank you for this warm house and our own little family\" (Spinelli 108). He goes outside and paints \"101\" on the front door, justifying their existence and their home. Sadly, Grayson dies, and once again Maniac is orphaned. Maniac runs again until he finds another family, the McNabs. This family, from the West End, consists of a drunken father and three neglected sons. Maniac feels that these children live like orphans. Maniac tries to instill right from wrong in the McNab children but wonders, \"how he could act as a father to these boys when he himself ached to be somebody's son?\" (155). This is not a good environment for Maniac. The McNabs are racist, and Maniac cannot live with them. He feels pride for the East End. He runs away from the McNabs to the zoo, until Amanda Beale comes to call him home. \"You are coming home...to sleep in your room...not here. This is not your home\"(183). Maniac is happy to go home. \"Children's literature is increasingly demonstrating that families cannot be so easily dichotomized as `traditional' or `non-traditional' and no one family is `normal', `typical', or representative of all families\" (Bunkers 128). Spinelli embraces these new types of families that mirror our culture in his novel and because of this, he is able to give a boy a home to call his own.Cited works: Spinelli,Jerry. Maniac Magee. Boston:Little, Brown and Company,1990. Bunkers, Suzanne. \"We Are Not The Cleavers\": Images of Non-traditional Families in Children's Literature\"The Lion and the Unicorn 16.1 (1992):115-133. Looking into non-traditional families This book is written by my favorite author - Jerry Spinelli. This book is so good that each time I read it, it gets more suspensful, fun, and there is more adventure each time. I would recommend this book to people who like suspense and action. If you like Harry Potter, you will love Maniac Magee. He's like Harry Potter, except he does it without magic. A magical book..... Since this book won the Newbery, I expected a good book. But it's mostly tells, not shows--a no-no for writers. The author tells just about everything. There aren't that many actual dialogue scenes between the characters. I didn't find this book interesting at all. Just because a book wins the Newbery doesn't mean it's going to be a winner. Surprisingly Uninteresting Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T. DarkBlade I wasn't such a &quot;Maniac&quot; Over this book Upon finishing Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli, I think I love it and dislike it all at the same time. Whenever I prepare to write a review on Amazon, I like to read as many previously written reviews as possible, just to gauge where everyone else stands with the novel. It seems as though the five star reviews loved this book because of the message and plot involved. Many of the one star reviewers, though, said the book was \"boring.\"Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing kids saying that \"I wouldn't have read this book if it weren't assigned in school.\" I dislike seeing kids being forced to read a certain book, because it may turn them off to further reading at a crucial age. Since this book has received the reputable Newbery Award some time ago, interest in it is higher than usual. However, as I said with Kira-Kira, PLEASE don't blindly assign children to read award winning books simply because they are on some list. Just because they have won these fantastic awards, doesn't mean they're for everybody.This book intends to tell the story of racial prejudice. Jerry Spinelli usually tackles some interesting issues in his stories, and Maniac Magee is no exception. The storyline itself is compelling and charming and some of the characters are very likeable, particularly Grayson, Amanda and her family. There were so many characters in this book though, that it was easy to get them mixed up.I know a few people who love the work of Jerry Spinelli and enthusiastically promote his work. As a result I decided to check out some of his novels. Spinelli writes in such a quirky way that one would find either off-putting or fantastic. I think I'm somewhere in between. While I love the fact that his novels are unique and unusual, I can see how children could find his writing difficult to read at times. He doesn't always flow smoothly and uses a very unusual style to describe something. He's not your typical author, that's for sure.This book is recommended for ages 8 through 12. Usually children like to read a book whose characters are older than they are. Spinelli's characters are usually rather young and would naturally attract a younger audience. However, the way that he writes may be too difficult for such a young audience. I was a bright kid, but honestly I think a lot of this novel would have gone over my head if I read it at age 8, simply because the reader has to read between the lines a great deal of the time with this book and my capabilities of doing that at age 8 were limited at best. If I know I would have struggled with it, I know there are other children out there who would do the same. This is not to say that ALL children would not understand this book, but there will be some. To Each Their Own Well, I am now a true fan of Spinelli's first I read Stargirl and now this wonderful tale. In a way he reminds me of John Steinbeck, both have this organic quality to their writing. You know these characters they are writing about aren't real, but at the same time you instantly feel like these are people you could look up from the page of your book and meet--the feel like people you already know. Which is amazing. Clearly Spinelli is in the right line of work.Maniac Magee has the same tall tale feel to it that Stargirl does. The world he plays in is a little bigger than hers, but both are loved and hated in very similar ways. He also refuses to see a persons faults and instead only focuses on their worth.Overall the book is sending a message about racisim, and how it really doesn't make sense, but there are other lessons througout the book. Which is really impressive because even for a book at this age level it isn't that long. Each chapter is only a few pages long which gives the reader the same feeling of running that Maniac Magee does throughout the entire book.No wonder school kids are always having to read this for some class or another. Its a book that tackles serious subjects but in a way that is not heavy handed and at times light hearted.Great great book!one last thought--ironic isn't it, how he is always running, like he's in a race and the book is about racisim? interesting play on words Spinelli does there. Very worthy of the Newberry I thought the book was boring. Maniac's parents died in a P and W trolley falling off a bridge because the driver was drunk.After Maniac heard the news,he stayed with his aunt and uncle.He ran away because his aunt and uncle annoyed him because they had seperate things and they never talk to each other.As he ran, he spoted the ball park.At the end,he realizes that life is not a game.This book made me think about running from problems. maniac magee I am using this book with my students. They seem to enjoy the book, and enjoy discussing Jeffery (Maniac). I feel that the characters are well developed which in turn brings out the problems with the two sides of the new town. We read a book dealing with prejudious and racism last year. Therefore, I felt using a book that was in the same vein, but taking a different tatic on the subject would also be good. I like a book that keeps the students interest. Also it makes it good for comprehension, and it will lead to some writing assignments as well. Maniac Magee Maniac Magee was an excellent book with a moral.Maniac's parents die from an accident, so Maniac is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Maniac decides to run away from the both of them, leaving Maniac homeless. In Maniac's city, all the black people were on the East Side and all the white people were on the West Side. Maniac goes and lives with new friend's that he meets, both on the East Side and on the West Side. No one is to onto the opposite \"Side\" unless that person works there. Blacks on one side, whites on the other. Maniac has many fantastic talents. He can run super, super fast, untie a know that measures over three blocks long when finally undone, and many others. The moral of this story is: don't judge people by their skin color.Maniac Magee is over all, a great book! I recommend this book to all ages! Maniac Magee is a Story With a Meaning This is what I thouthg of the book: it was so-so. This book was about a little boy who lst his parents when he was a little boy so when he found out he had to go live with his Aunt Dot and his Uncle Dan On is Aunt and Uncle did not get along because they had to do stuff seperley so Maniac ran away and lived with his friend and he made new friends.This book made me think of who it whould fill with out my mom and bad,and how it will fill if I had to live with Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan. So this is what i thouth of the book. Maniac Magee Although I've always been a fan of Jerry Spinelli's writing, this is definitely his best work. Warning: If you're looking for plot summary, read the standard amazon review, 'cause I don't want to repeat it.It's amazing how Spinelli has managed to take an issue as touchy as racial prejudice and managed to present it in a way that is not only understandable, but very realistic...Spinelli writes with a style that not only tells the story of a poor orphaned kid with famous - nay, legendary - abilities, but also provokes thought on many other issues, including racism, death, seperation, and many other scary but real issues in the lives of America's youth.I've read this book numerous times over the course of my life, and as I've gotten older (6 years or so have passed since I first read it), I still appreciate the message and story told by this book. Powerful...for people of many ages. My whole family (2 grown ups and a twelve year old) enjoyed this one. A really good story, one you don't want to put down. Best of all, it is infused with a message of tolerance that doesn't preach. Perfect for 5th and 6th graders. terrific book As a kid, this book drew me in quickly. It is fast paced and fun, and \"Maniac\" lives the life every little boy wishes he could. But to read the whole novel is not to want to stay young... Jeffrey learns about responsibility, and maturity, and how to love the unloveable. The book teaches us that home is a place of love and healing and growth, not a place where people look similar. I fell in love with this book in third grade, but it might be a bit more suitable for the 5th-7th grade level, or a fairly advanced reader of a younger age. A book for boys who want to be men Maniac Magee is a wonderful book. It was great, Once I started reading it I was hooked for the rest of the book. I liked how Maniac even though he was small he could do things that other bigger kids didn't. It gave a chance for the short people to be better than everybody else at something. It is about a boy orphand when he was only three years old. He is sent to live with his closest relatives. He can't stand them. His relatives argued a lot and stopped talking to each other. He Loves to run, he better at things than any other kid and he prooves it. It shows that even thought he is good at everything he has feelings too. I really liked it, I will tell everybody I know to read this book. It is intended for mainly teenagers. Maniac Magee From the Beales to Earl Grayson. This kid is a legend. Maniac in my point of view is he is a kind-hearted kid, who always takes your breath away. I wish the story never had to end. I also take Maniac as a diamond in the rough. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do. I gave this wonderful story a five star rating. Thank you for your time.- Secret Reader Praise for the legend 'Maniac Magee' I think the book Maniac Magee is a great book by Jerry Spinell. He really explained alot of things in detail. It is a very funny and exciting book! I really liked the wayManaic Magee wasn't scared of anyone and he could make friends with anyone. My favorite part was when Manaic hit the frog fling home run. I think that the way people were willing to help manaic out and be there for him shows the good side of our world. Amanda was a great charctor because she was helpful in everyway. I know that this book shows how people can help each other and how the blacks and whites can work together. I would recommend this book to any one that might have probles with different colored skin that can understand how to work there prprobles out. Or to just a young teen that is looking for a good book to read. I know I love this bookbecause I have read it more than once and I hope you will too. This book is great! The character in this story is Maniac Magee, but his name isn't really Maniac Magee. when he was born, he was known as Jeffrey Lionel Magee. His parnets died nad that's when his life changed and so did his name.the best known thing that Maniac or \"Jeffrey \" Magee is known for is for what he did for the kids from the east side and those from the west side. But there still a puzzeling question. Whyndid he help those kids and why was he near those areas. If you want to find out more go to your local libary and check it out. You'll never know what will surprise you. CRAZY MAN",

         "The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))",
         "It is very easy to see why this novel is a classic, i do not know about other people conclusions but for me it shows simply that our own mind is a very hard judge for us, humans; and that our natural behavior hardly ever gonna live up to our mind expectations. A Classic This is a very interesting story by the immensely quotable Wilde. It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \"wanted\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could. God and the Devil The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! Great story with amazing insights. If you didn't read this book, do it. Even if you watched the movies and didn't like them, or particularly if you didn't like the movies. As always Oscar Wilde shows here a great talent to analyze human society and behavior, creating an extremely interesting book in the process. No movie can match the beauty of the original book Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt. Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book. You are supposed to hate most of the characters. Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards. This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant. Cheers Short and... well not sweet The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust. A story that is as relevant today as when it was written arrived in good shape; classic addition to library, have not read it yet so cannot comment further at this time. classic The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull. This book makes for a good read. :) Great condition Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain. relax Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\"The picture of Dorian Gray\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work. \"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter\"-Oscar Wilde This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!) What seems clear is that the novel could not be divorced from Wilde's reputation.But as a novel, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is wonderful and strange--if not entirely \"successful\". With this Annotated and Uncensored Edition of Wilde's book, we have its history and definitive text.

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition. Wonderful In Every Way I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner. A true classic with beautiful prose Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path. Reflecting On Morality Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read. Merits a second read... It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic. Book Before Movie loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth Brilliant! I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! WELL WORTH BUYING This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot.I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?\" he asked, looking at her across the table. \"A great many, I fear,\" she cried. \"Then commit them over again,\" he said gravely. \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\" Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.Punctuality is the thief of time.Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure.You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.Anybody can be good in the country.To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Oscar Wilde knew something about human nature. Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! Great Read I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Oscars wit runs Wilde This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. Beware The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing. A tale of corruption and a cynic man are the eesence of the story that has captivated generations. Read it. One of the best When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an `immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a `spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray. Masterpiece that was written ahead of its time It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \"expressing,\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \"let it all hang out.\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \"as easy and graceful as ever.\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \"the end of the century\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO- When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\" The Picture of Dorian Grayby Oscar WildeOriginally Published in 1890.Grade: B+Roughly, this novel can be cataloged as a \"Transgressional Fiction.\" A main character, Dorian Gray, leads a hedonistic life, believing that a life serving senses and beauty is the most ideal way to lead one. The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that `Ugliness is the only reality.'\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that `All art is quite useless\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled `useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \"All art is quite useless,\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called `Aesthetic Movement,\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\"\"`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\"\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\"\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\"\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"To define is to limit.\"\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\"\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth. Sin and Art in our lives Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many. Better the First Time The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. Gothic Classic I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read. A cautionary tale I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. Oscars wit runs Wilde Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side. Jekyll and Hyde (Mostly Hyde) Without the Potion This book is a classic for a reason, and this particular edition is excellent because there are notes and explanations as well as discussions of the trials of Wilde for indecency. I found it fascinating and thought-provoking. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially those interested in historical cultures. A classic look at the themes of vanity, influence and the corruption of the soul. One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in `The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age. A tale of pleasures without consequence The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \"preaches\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people. Review for Dorian Grey The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \"portrait\" in our minds as well. Suspenseful Page Turner But A Little Lengthy I knew the story and had seen the films but never read the book. Worth while read of a classic. Good Book I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \"off the rails\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book. Interesting Dorian Gray realizes in the winter of his life that he has been deceived by hedonistic philosophies of Lord Henry and thereafter he succumbs to the depravity of his lifestyle. The unadulterated pursuit of pleasure leaves every man desperately empty. Oh that Dorian would have sought the Lord Jesus who will remake a man despite his past. Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow. This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. Fantastic, haunting The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece. Good, Not Great Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. . A book everyone should read The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. Vanity This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \"curse\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions. Is beauty only skin deep and what happens to the outside of someone who has become hideous inside?With beautiful turns of phrase and provoking insights which will invade your thoughts long after you put the book down, this is a class worth your time. Haunting tale told beautifully. The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" To Gain the Whole World, but Lose the Soul The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \"must-read.\" Timeless Quest for Youth and Beauty with a Twist this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words Great story, imformative notes Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short. An interesting read... The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. Simple Message, Great Story I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy The Picture of Dorian Gray My mother had recommended this book to me awhile ago, saying though she'd never read it, I'd probably like it. I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson The Picture of Dorian Gray I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \"Importance of Being Earnest.\" And his \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away! Wilde Nearly Redefines Literature There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading. A This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. The story of Every Person I had heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray, I knew what it was about, but I never imagined it was going to be such a good book. At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \"revealing\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far. My own experience reading The Picture Of Dorian Gray I have read this book in my AP English class in high school and this is be far on my top 5 favorite books and an easy read. Classic What can you say? This book was as good when I read it this time as it was when I read it twenty years ago. Oscar has it going on with this one. Timeless classic The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. A philosophical inquest into deleterious effects of sinful and vulgar living One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing. A Classic This is a great classical novel. I enjoyed it very much and I am certainly looking forward to keep reading Wilde's works. Great novel Excellent book! A classic. I read this in high school and did not pay to close attention to the details and the wisdom surrounding this story, but now that I have lived a few more years it makes so much more sense.... great book This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\" A favorite Oscar Wilde never disappoints. His plays are amazing & so is his only novel, \"The picture of dorian gray\". This is one of my favorite classics novels. Wilde's vivid details captured my intrest from the very first page. The characters were well developed, the ending was great. Overall, this is a must read book! It has everything from suspense, romance, drama, to art. I would definitely have to read it again sometime. Maybe it'll be the first book I ever re-read. Beauty is only skin deep Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite. Oscar Wilde Was One Of The Best. The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy! dorian gray is a 1700's soap opera :) Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. Picture of Dorian Gray I thought it was good, I don't know why people are saying it was boring. good Everyone should read this book. What interesting ideas and philosophy are presented! It is not your average battle between good and evil - this is a pained battle. The protagonist does not behave like any usual protagonist - good, pure, lovely. You're not quite sure who you're rooting for throughout the book an the ending seems both just, unjust, mercuful, and harsh. What a book. Really makes you think. Exquisite Literature I have read the book and realy enjoyed it. I also have the DVD of it. You realy must get both. Picture of Dorian Gray I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) Great, Great Read! As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one. Glad to have read this classic Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye! Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided. Platter of Amorality The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. Cavalier and irreverent statement on life and society, To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up. A timeless treasure This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out. Very Interesting Look into Human Nature While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \"phew\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic. A classic. Thought provoking for each of us. I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral! Excellent Book, boring book, genial book... Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book. Who wants to look young forever? Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\"l'art pour l'art\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \"posing as a sodomite\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \"gross indecencies,\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \"hard labor\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \"immoral\" book, if \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \"care twopence\" - could consider this novel \"perverted,\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \"[a]ll art is quite useless,\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. Boring How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! Awesome title Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \"tragic ending\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be. Wonderful As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic. Hello? The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities. The writing style was absolutely maddening!The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \"classic\")After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore. Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying. Bottom line: Boooooooooooooring! What a SNOOZE!!!!! First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Very Good Story but Deep Wow...I had been under the impression prior to reading the novel that this was one of the great works of Western Literature in the past 200 or so years...Never have I been so dissapointed. While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf... Greatly Overrated... Wilde gives us fabulous quotes and a delicious hedonistic storyline, with as always a sence of humor - pleasure to read. Flamboyant Wilde The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader. Picture of Dorian Gray definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good interesting. One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing.

But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman \"Beauty is a form of Genius.\" Excellent read of classic literature.

I truly great read and a classic that has stood the test of time. Incredible book The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator. A fine example of Wildean Wit. Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading. Be careful what you wish for Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall. Good read I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' A Classic Story.... I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \"Penguin\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \"Pocket Book\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \"Japanese effect\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap. Pick this Kindle Edition, not the Free one I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read! One of my favorites I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read. A Thrilling Read Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through... Great book, ruined by copy cats! Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also. Dorian Gray: a Novel That Outlasts It's Age... This was a great book chalk full of meaning. I liked how Dorian had both good and bad influences about him, yet he succumbed to one and destroyed the other. God and the devil This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch. Beware The novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life. Possibly not the easiest read, but... I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young. could this be love? This book is simply amazing. It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read. Great book This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book The Picture of Dorian Gray The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. An interesting story I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave. Disregard the rating. Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. Glad to be finished writing a research paper about this book What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of `relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self The life of Mr. Gray loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth Brilliant! The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of those stories that your supposed to and not supposed to read at the same time. You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting. As pretty as a picture...and just as revealing. All the great reviews speak for themself! It's a book written by Oscar Wilde, that alone ought to make you order right on the spot! This book is great! I love it! And I love Dorian Gray! Get this book! What can I say that hasn't already been said? This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate. delightful conjectures I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point. Love to read Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading. A bit of a high horse for Wilde. Wonderful book; vanity is a terrible thing. Read this book, the classics are worth reading especially when you don't have to. The picture of Dorian Gray The preface is missing which is a critical to the book! Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise! Where is the famous preface? Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended. Wilde's Only Novel is Delightful I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift. Another edition of the timeless book When I first began reading this book I was intrigued. The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Nice book and really nothing more Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony.

The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time. Classic Classic and amazing. I have read this about three times already and still enjoy every minute of it although the hints of homosexuality kind of through me off. Fantastic. This free classic version for my Kindle was very good! It's the first Oscar Wilde tale I have read and I found it to be reader-friendly, engrossing and surprising at the end. Picture of Dorian Gray Rich characters, nice flow and if you don't know anything about the story I think you'll be having a hard time putting this one down. I've heard the name of topic brought up enough in life to recognize the title but was blessed with no spoilers being laid out and I was surprised at how engrossed I was with this read. I usually am weary about picking up classics because i don't like to get lost in the language but Mr. Wilde is clear and concise in his descriptions and His characters were very personable and interesting.I say READ IT! READ IT NOW! What a Wilde book This was so intersting you do not want want to put down, very much a book you can get lost into Saw this as a movie years ago Beyond just the text, this edition gives a wonderful overview into the full cultural context of Oscar Wilde's original work, and all the influences that resulted in its changes. Fascinating and informative First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun. Glad to be finished writing a research paper about this book The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story. Simple Message, Great Story The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \"yearly re-read\" shelf for certain. Review of The Picture of Dorian Gray First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. Timeless classic? I hardly think so. Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. poisonous by beauty A book for all time. This is a piece we could all use to search the places in our souls that need careful review and study. Probably Oscar Wilde's greatest work that continues to live on. Timeless message Oscar Wilde's only novel is, in my opinion, his greatest work. While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be. A Victorian tale for our time The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing. An interesting story \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \"musings\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read. My First Wilde What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned. An excellent story This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...) Dorian Gray The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely. Oscar Wilde himself was accused of homosexual act and was sent to jail fortwo years. He left England and moved to France where he died at avery young age. What a loss? mind over matter I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought. Masterful It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT. The Picture of Dorian Gray The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel. Not really that good..... It is a tale of moral decadence and debauchery. Dorian seems consumed in his self portarit, his love for himself is so big that he cannot see beyond his image and when his true image dawns on him he dies. However i did not give him five stars because of the way the plot moves. It is a little bit slow and only at the end you feel it taking full force. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com a tale of moral decadence I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? Beauty is only skin deep In the course of his career Oscar Wilde, an Irish writer and poet known for his epigrams and more notably as one of the most popular playwrights in London in the late 1800's, wrote only one solitary novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \"beauty for beauty's sake\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy. The Picture of Dorian Gray: Oscar Wilde evaluation This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else. Intense and Dark (3 1/2 stars) While the plot and subplots take many twists and turns, they are easy to follow. The uncanny &#34;ability&#34; of the portrait is very intriguing. Watch the movie after reading the novel. Superb",

The book is well written and straight forward in describing how to develop a process master.In my field of information technology (IT), it is critical for progam designers to have a baseline of how a program presently works. This is best done by a representative team of end users. I have found process mastering the most economical and efficient way to get a document that describes the current system. By doing a process master the team becomes empowered to improve the present process without the IT people and to know what else they want or need IT to do for them. Additionally, the team becomes more effective in their participation in the joint application development (JAD) with the IT folks.The philosophy behind the approach is very empowering to employees since it is they, the people who do the work, who develop the process masters. I am also pleased with the emphasis that the book puts on understanding the needs of internal and external customers.Finally, I can recommend this book to anyone who has processes they want to improve and who sees the value of engaging the energy, thought and commitment of their employees to do it. This book, this process, is truly liberating even to the extent of giving meaning and value to previously mundane work. A Practical empowering way to document a process",

         "From Russia, With Love",
         "Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are certainly not the mixed bag that the films are, but some are certainly better than others. From Russia with Love is, along with Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, among the best.From Russia with Love starts off on a different foot than most of the other Bond novels. Bond himself doesn't appear until part two, 95 pages into the story. Until then, the story centers on the deadly operatives of SMERSH, Soviet Russia's spy-killing organization. It's this first part that sets up the main plot of the story--a Russian scheme not only to assassinate James Bond, but to do so in a way that will scandalize the English public and shame the Secret Service. One of the more famous Bond girls, young Tatiana Romanova is suckered into posing as \"bait\" for Bond, and unbeknownst to her, both she and Bond are set up to die at the hands of Irish psychopath Red Grant.With those pieces in place, the plot proceeds methodically from point A to point B. Fleming was never a master plotter, but that's not the point. Having all the parts set up and ready for action generates enormous suspense--when, for instance, is the serial-killing Grant going to make his inevitable and violent appearance? Even for those who have seen the film version, there's plenty here to surprise and lots of white-knuckle thriller chases, fights, bombings, and near-misses.The book does have flaws. Bond is a bit too obtuse and more of a pawn than usual, and Tania is just a bit too wide-eyed and innocent, which I suppose is the point. But the book moves so briskly from the opening setup through the building suspense and action that one hardly has time to criticize the characters--the world is moving just as fast for them.From Russia with Love is one of Fleming's best not only because of his signature pace and action, but because, in this novel, he takes the time to develop menacing villains and show us, before Bond ever steps onstage, just how dangerous they are. The androgynous Rosa Klebb and giant, moon-crazed Red Grant are well-developed and certainly among the best of Bond villains.On a final note, upon reading this novel have Doctor No, the book's immediate sequel, on hand, because Fleming's ending is so abrupt and laden with ambiguity that you'll want to jump right into the next book. This is either a weakness or a strength. I'll go with strength.Highly recommended. One of the best Bond novels As I watched the last 007 movie I couldn't help but want more....quick read now I want more James Bond. Loved it! Fully one-half of the way through \"From Russia With Love\", by Ian Fleming, the reader awaits the first action scene - related to the main theme of the book, the nasty spy intrigues and assassinations of the Cold War. How \"007\" and Fleming got their images and reputations from this book is beyond me.Yes, during the first half of the book there is a brilliantly executed build-up, a plenitude (too much perhaps?) of minute detail (especially the faces of the characters), and promises or hints of something more (hopefully some action or intrigue) to come.The classic, 1950's-1960's settings in Moscow, London & Istanbul are fun to read. Since I visited each of those cities in the very early 1960's, I was amused and pleased at the accurate depictions.As Bond and the fem fatale Tanya depart Istanbul on the Orient Express, the pace picks up, thankfully. Actually for the first 80% of the story, the hero and main character is MI5's Istanbul officer Kerim, a Turk. Up to that point, Bond is a minor character, strangely nave, notably uncertain, and only an eager, bumbling follower.For the most part, except for many oft-repeated pet phrases, it's well-written, this story. Bond improved in the last 20% of the story, becoming somewhat the \"Bond, James Bond\" we know from all those movies. It is possible that the movies (which we have all seen at least 4 times) gave us a truly false picture of 007?All-in-all, Bond, as a cold war spy, disappoints through almost all of the story as a mistake-prone, super nave, very gullible and ineffective officer the realm. One must endure the book for the denouement scene on the train. The final few pages are almost laughable and quite unsatisfying.I give it a weak 3.00 on Amazon's scale, if only out of respect for Fleming's body of work and as a thank you for creating the character of James Bond. But make no mistake, \"From Russia with Love\" is wholly disappointing. James Bond Is a Nave, Gullible Boob This is the first Bond book that I have read, and I have to say that it wasn't a very good first impression.Bond spends the majority of the book. He is talked about, and he watches the action happen around him. Towards the end of the book he finally becomes somewhat active, however he misses every clue that he is given. WHen the bad guy finally makes an appearence - after sooo much was told about him at the start of the book, his entire history - he only spends a short amount of time in the action of the book. He reveals the entire plan to Bond, and then is of course killed by Bond. Not because Bond is super cool, but because Bond is super lucky.Of course the woman, the \"heroine\" spends the entire book either making love to Bond or sleeping, but I never expected anything more.Overall, I'm not sure what the appeal of Bond is, but maybe as a friend suggested, I picked the worst one out of the Bond books. I find nothing wrong with formulaic spy books, but this was bad. Readable Oh yes, those beautiful Russian girls and their decoders can really tie you into knots. Isn't that right Mr. James Bond? Get the Lecter and the girl, but at what price? From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight. A Veeerrrrryyy interesting ending Fleming does a great job introducing us to all of the characters in this novel. Like the movie this novel allows us to see Bond as a secret agent, not a superman saving the world. A must read for all Bond Movie fans. One of the best five Bond novels This is one of my favorite James Bond books. I read it as a child and I recently repurchased it for the Kindle to reread it. I still own all of the original paperback books but they are so fragile that I am afraid to read them as I fear they may come unbound.I liked this book a lot because of the detailed plot by SMERSH and their plans to entrap Bond and kill him. The assassin is a master killer with a devious and detailed plan to complete his mission. I won't ruin the story for you but you probably already know it from reading the book before or watching the movie.I think that Ian Fleming was at his best writing when he wrote this book. I feel that in his mind the Bond character was fully developed as well as the hated of the Russians for Bond who always seemed to be able to thwart their devious plans with his skills. This story is solid and well written with love, romance, murder, trickery and suspense in it. I truly enjoyed this story and it is one of my favorites. If you are a James Bond and Ian Fleming fan then this is a must read for you. Even the ending is dramatic! SMERSH has decided that Bond must be killed and British secret service embarrassed! From Russia, with Love has a great plot and is well written. Fleming has a great way of portraying his characters. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I read it twice.

         "I know its a bad anthology but just look at his picture. Look at that smile, you'd know that there is the evil smile right there. Now, to back my idea that Pat Robertson is evil, look at the things he is \"preaching\":- Patty likes to preach hate, which he is GREAT at. Oh, hate this and that, lets hate all the Hindu and all the Jews and all the Buddhists and all the Mulisms and even Catholics and some Protestants but just not Patty!- Patty actually proclaims that \"he can communicate to God\", basically you know he is right there insulting Him by preaching all the blasphemy and hatread.- Patty is absoutely 100% sure he is going directly to heaven without question, at least that's what he wants people to think that he is! And fool people into feeling free to drink and cuss and harm others just as long as they \"find God\" at the very last second. By this, he taking more innocent people away from the rightful God that awaits them.Well there you have it! What kinda of a preacher would preach hate? The last time I went to a chuch I don't remember the preacher preaching hate! Even people of different religions won't preach hate so why would a \"Christian\" named Patty Robertson be doing so?Finally, keep in mind that Pat Robertson is a millionaire, and owns several estates. However, I don't remember reading the newspaper saying he made great donations to churchs!The last word: buy this book to see why Pat Roberstson is so dangerous, it doesn't matter if you're right or left-wing, we should always be viligent and aware of the danger and evil around us to avoid it.

         "Jane Eyre (New Windmill)",
         "Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \"fairy tale\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \"blindness\" in the novel. First, he is \"blind\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \"plain\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \"stuck in the mud\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic. Jane Eyre is a strong protagonist, but this book should be read later in life This was fun as a romance novel, without the really steamy parts! It is always interesting to read books that were written before electricity. Romance in the 1840's The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies. Love this book! This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics. Wonderful Book I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!! Loved it Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though. Jane&iexcl;s courage, self-respect and independent helps her towards to her life and overcome all the difficulties, finally obtain her life and her true love. hero in my heart I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down even for a second.I loved the writing style and the depth of the characters. Amazing I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \"mad wife in the attic\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \"hero\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \"Jane Eyre\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind Re-thinking Mr. Rochester Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\"Jane Eyre\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester. One of the Great Romances This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist. Beautifully Written This book surprised me not having pages long descriptions of nature and place, which I like. The story is exciting, eventful and sends a great message about love, respect and God. I really enjoyed it... also because it is written in beautiful old English. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. One of the best love stories horrible book specially bcuz the language was weird. i remcommend this book to old fashioned people. la la la la umm Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel. (...) Depth unimagined This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (\"manly\" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The \"I heard your voice in the wind\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century! Better than I expected Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!! The Greatest Romance Ever Written!!! it is true that many would consider the language in here outdated. I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts. Classic i had no problems with my order and it was delivered very quickly. thank you. i will be looking here first when i need to order books next semester fast delivery This was an adorable little book that was very affordable. I loved the look and antique feel. The book mark was also a nice touch. cute little book I read this book years ago and wanted to read it again. I couldn't remember much about the story. I really enjoyed it, even though some of the language of that time was hard to follow at times. Jane Eyre I had to read this novel for my IB English class and I couldn't even imagine reading this novel as it was one of the longest and thickest book I have ever seen; not to mention that this book is a \"classic\" (aka a long boring book with bunch of long weird words). As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \"quick read\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel. This novel combines a heaping of drama, a dash of romance, and a pinch of Gothic horror. I think that there is something in this book that appeals to all reading Connoisseurs out there. Although I would consider Jane Eyre herself plain I definitely would not consider this novel that. Anything but a Plain 'Jane' Book This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \"Amphigorey,\" among others. There weren't so many as to be distracting; only enough to make you anticipate one as the story reached an important turning point. Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a bit of contemporary art with their classic lit. Brilliant illustrations Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read. I chose the book for a school project and was honestly not expecting to enjoy the read. I was pleasantly surprised to find a book that was relatable and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down. No well-read person should miss out on this classic. A Fabulous Novel Completely has no detectable flaws in my point of view. Totally seems like the writer is a great writer. :) Awesome book I had always wanted to read this after seeing the old movie from before I was born (I'm 59). It tells so much more of Jane Eyre's life a as a young girl. A Favorite It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years. Great book Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style. Jane Eyre This book misrepresents itself. We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \"Peek inside\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear. Choose a different version of this classic I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \"coincidences\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey. mixed feelings... Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature. A 19th century masterpiece Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book. My opinion on Pride and Prejudice Enjoyed this book so much. Very readable and engaging.It may have been written long ago, but is still enjoyable. A great read. I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud. How on earth can anyone find Jane Eyre boring?? I have always wanted to read the classics. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel. Classics Although this book's words are quite hard to understand, the plot of this story is amazing. I am only 13 years old but I enjoyed this book loads. I recommend it!!!!!!!!! Hard, but good I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . . hasn't held up well for me I absolutely loved this book. Jane's character is one that you just keep pulling for because you genuinely care what happens to her. She has a strong will and is the type of protagonist that I find inspiring. Although this is by no means a quick, light read I think that if you're a fan of the classics this is one that you need to add to your \"must read\" list. I look forward to rereading it!

Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \"Jane Eyre\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story. This is my favorite book. Exciting Gothic story The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque. What a piece of crap I've read it 4 times and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Always want to change what happens...and always imagine a healed Mr. Rochester. Review of Jane Eyre by Bronte Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \"Reader, I married him\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.' Greater than its reputation I'd been wanting to read Jane Eyre for quite some time. I even had a copy in my possession. The problem was that it was a boring edition. I couldn't get into it.All that changed when I saw this illustrated version on a shelf. The feel was amazing; the pages, the illustrations, the text-- everything came to life.I definitely recommend this edition to any Jane Eyre fans or those simply wishing for livelier way to enjoy this novel. I'm hoping she does more illustrated editions in the future. Dame Darcy brings this classic to life Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \"syrupy-ness\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while. this is what a romance should be... Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \"passionate\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \"coincidences\" which might have been classed as \"providence\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \"coincidences\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop. Love it, but the writing is a bit dull at times I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte. Lovedddddd it! I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, `Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes. A treasure This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over. I love this book! Definitely a keeper. Jane Eyre has been my favorite novel since I was 12 years old and every single time I read it again it just gets better and better. If you like reading good mysteries, biographies, and romance than Jane Eyre is your book. Charlotte Bronte spectacularly captures the emotions and feelings of the characters and creates a strong and independent lead.It's just wonderful, amazing, and the best book I've ever read.What are you doing reading this... you should have downloaded Jane Eyre and started reading it already. This Novel deserves 10 stars! I bought this book because I was interested in the author after being compared with her in my own writing. first person is not the way I write, but Charlotte Bronte did a great job and the book is a good read. Interested in this author. I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience! &quot;Poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;...and amazing I read this book as a teenager and enjoyed it. As an adult I love it.If you like historical romantic fiction you will enjoy Jane Eyre. I was captivated JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\" Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte This is a classic love story that you can't go wrong with. Classic! Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts. Jane Eyre: A Refreshing Love Story In many ways, `Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of `good' over `evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote `Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith An unconventional heroine Jane Eyre is a great classic novel. It was a pleasure to re-read it after many years.Would highly recommend. A great classic novel. 4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \"The Eyre Affair\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :) really 4.5 stars I did not realize the \"collector's library\" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read. Too small I have only seen the movie and I find much to my delight that th book far surpasses Hollywood's version. I can not believe that I never even considered taking the time. Now I intend to read as many of the classics as I can. After many years I finally read JANE EYRE Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius! STUNNING, MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful. A Rebel in Literature The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!! The freedom of finding true love I first read this in college, and didn't fully appreciate it at the time. But I have since read it several other times, and it has become a treasured favorite. Even better upon re-reading An old classic that I had largely forgotten. I enjoy the words that are no longer used and the chance with the kindle to look up definitions easily. Jane Eyre I read Wuthering Heights in high school and loved it, but never read any more of the Bronte sisters. Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \"busy\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!! I can't believe i waited so long I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story. Awesome Book I am 14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre). My favorite book! all the review's here say \"ooo u can't appreciate this as a teenager\". u know what??? i'm a YOUNG teen, and i can appreciate the romance in this story. the only thing is... idk it's heart wrenching in some parts but other parts its just... boring! i was forced to read this for a book report. whoever thinks we don't understand the romance then ur wrong because today's teenagers grow up quickly what w/ all the media and etc. we do understand. we might not take it as seriously but we do understand it. don't diss us and say this book is too difficult for us. my teacher would not have recommended this it us if she thought we were too ignorant to understand it. i'm thirteen This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too. A job well done My emotions were all of the place with this book. I consisted of well placed imagery and overall events. I believe I actually cried a few times, especially towards the end. I'm can truly and honestly say that I loved this book and I'm glad I had to read it for my AP English class. Unexpected Love Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book. Meaningless You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status. Do not miss out on this book... How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book. My favorite piece of literature This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre. true romance? I had to read this for English and its my new favorite high school book. I highly suggest it, mainly for girls. Love story Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \"Jane Eyre\" doesn't come close to \"Wuthering Heights,\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written. A Brit Lit classic &#34;I am a free person...&#34; I love this book. This had not been the first time I had read the book but definately different especially since it was the first time that I read it in digital format for the first time. Through this book I found out that I like the digital format; definitely not better than paper but nice on the train. Jane Eyre I bought this book to try to relate to old classic books but it was boring and I didn't even finish it. But that is just me and I don't like these types of books, but it was free, and you might like it, so it can't hurt. Eh brave jane, my favorite of the first person heroines. not a beauty - thank god, isnt that a relief! - but plain and puny and with an indomitable spirit. she chooses morality, in a line which i cant forget: \"and there i plant my foot.\" For rules are not made for when times are easy, or to be discarded when they are inconvenient, but are there as a lifesaver for when emotions and life are in disarray. read it over and over Great book, a real page turner. After reading many of Jane Austens novels I was told to try the Bronte sisters and it was definitely worth it!! Wow! This classic is witty and thought provoking. The plot is twisty enough to entertain the most experienced reader; you may guess the ending but not the path to it. Jane Eyre Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition, A timeless Classic in the English Canon Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \"Wuthereing Heights\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read. Woman of Great Importance first read Jane Eyre when I was fifteen. It was such a wonderful joy to my then teenage mind full of dreams of love one day.Rereading it every now and then it takes on new understanding each timeThe language would be difficult for teens today (no lol or texting talk!!) But I hope some will try-it is a very good storyAll in all I loved it all over again!! Romance revisited and absolutely enjoyable! This is my favorite love story ever and it's the third time I've read it. As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids. My favorite love story ever! I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story. great classic love story Got it to give as a valentines gift, but ended up keeping it! Very beautiful. Classic Jane Eyre When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again. Jane Eyre I loved Jayne Eyre as a young girl and read it many times but had not tried it as an adult. It turned out to be just as captivating for me now as it was then. One of the greatest classics Loved the insights in Charlotte's writing. It was such a pleasure to read and I was sad when I came to the end but not sad about the way it ended. Classic Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it. Review of Jane Eyre A true classic! Well worth the read. If you are tired of modern novels with too much sex and violence try reading the classics Jane Eyre is a great place to start. Jane Eyre - A great read Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties. Pride and Prejudice: A Classic Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults. Read it while you are young! This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre. Great Gothic Romance I love Barnes and Nobles Classics books. The quality of these books are very nice. I will continue to buy them. Love I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males. A Classic Gothic Novel Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like. Jane Eyre It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre I have been passionate about Jane Eyre for going on twenty years now. It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \"martyrdom\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever. One of the very best The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back. The book never came I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \"classics,\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name) The classic I'm always happy to read It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then. Jane Eyre For all you out there who aren't very big fans of classical literature, I assure you that this book will not disappoint. This is a beautiful love story that isn't too hard to understand as far as classic books go, and is well worth the effort. A guaranteed good read I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not. Timeless Tale I am 41 years old and have read this book four times, about once a decade. An absolute must read for anyone who loves serious reading, and sorry, Jane Austen, but Charlotte Bronte rocks the house in ways you never could! A Raging River i normally dont go for the books that take alot of thinking but this book is now one of my favorites. it is a perfect combination of romance and mystery. for sure a great read i highly recomend! woderful book Have wanted to read Jane Eyre for a long time. Have found the novel worth the time as well as in the populist and feminist perspectives. Jane Eyre timeliness Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99. Though this makes skipping back easy when your listening to it in the car, it might reek havoc on your MP3 player. The box is thin cardboard, and the CD's come in thin paper sleeves. Well performed reading of a Gothic classic If you haven't read it, you're in for a quiet explosion. Just think about when Bronte wrote this and wonder where...WHERE...in the world did this woman get all of her insight? I cannot recommend this enough. Every time I read this treasure, I learn more I have several copies of this novel & it's one of my favorites of all time. I will read & re-read always. One of my favorites! \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \"Gone with the Wind\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \"Wuthering Heights\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light* \"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\" I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story! Jane Eyre Still on Top I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures... A wonderful surprise I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest. Great Classic I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly. A classic This is my all time favorite read!

The story has so many twists and turns and is so well told. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I read it on my phone and appreciate being able to read the Kindle version free. Wonderful Timeless Classic Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine. A Masterpiece that Transends Generations The novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is a timeless story of an orphaned girl. The story of Jane Eyre begins with a look into her unpleasant life while living with her cruel aunt and cousins. To escape her family, Jane escapes to a school in which she spends eight years. Upon leaving Lowood, Jane decides to better her life by becoming a governess. She takes this position at a place called Thornfield Hall where she teaches a young girl named Adele.This novel is well interpreted to show the struggles of an orphaned girl. It also demonstrates how much courage a woman can have in their life even though things may seem impossible.This book is likely to appeal to an older age group. The language is difficult to understand at times and younger people may have trouble staying interested just because the novel is extremely descriptive. An older age group would probably have enough patience to let the splendor of the story unfold. It's also a longer story of 456 pages in which really could have been written well in half the length. Jane Eyre Book Review Though there were a few minor changes in this version, it definitely does not alter the spirit of the great narrative, nor does it inhibit the reader's comprehension. Given the fact that it is a free edition, this is a fantastic vessel toward familiarity with a true classic. A Great Read This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane. Great book! This book is a great book for those that love stories about love, duty, and the Victorian era. I loved Jane Eyre's character because it was the typical heroine from this time in British History. She is dutiful and proper despite her low circumstances. I love Victorian novels because they always have a happy ending! Wonderful Romance I LOVE this edition! It has so many helpful explanations in the back - it's a fantastic work of a beautiful, beautiful book. I have several copies - this is my favorite - hands-down.My only criticism is the ribbon - it unravels too easily. Bind the end of it so it doesn't do that. PERFECTION!! If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school! Classic for Young Women and Christians So glad I re-read this classic. Reading it 40 years after the first time opened my eyes to aspects of history and the beauty of this classic that I didn't see the first time. Wonderful book I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book. Thios book has meaning suprizing twist and turn. It makes you feel sorry for Jane everything that happens to her. Charlotte wrote this book as if she were Jane. It simply amazing. It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!! This is a very ssuspensefull and emotionally enrapturing book. I suggest it to anyone looking to read a great book.God Bless ~Amy A very rich fulfilling story one of the best novels written. Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :) BRILLIANT!!",

         "Crossing: A Memoir",
         "This is the story of one Donald McCloskey, a biological male who went on to become a full transsexual. He is now a transsexual as well as a widely published economist. I learned a lot from this memoir about the life of a transsexual who started out as a married, heterosexual cross-dresser. He erotically cross-dressed before becoming a transsexual.I was hoping for a more theoretical framework. For example, there is NO mention of the major kinds of transsexuality. There is absolutely NO mention whatsoever of autogynephilia or of homosexual transsexuality for that matter. None. I also wondered about Deirdre's sexual life post-operatively, as I am sure other readers did.I liked the photographs of Don and Deirde both pre- and post-operatively.The narrative is a little hard to read because of all the bold face, mixed with regular face. I think this was meant to emphasize McCloskey's transsexual verus heterosexuality identity.Despite the book's inherent limitations, I would recommend McCloskey's interesing memoir to anyone seriously interested in transsexuality. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone looking for a more formal treatment of either autogynephilia or homosexual transsexuality. A Somewhat Limited But Useful Perspective I found Deirdre's memoir refreshing, honest, and insightful, as well as humorous. Deirdre is not an author who takes her self too seriously, though dealing with personal experiances that are both serious and painful.Her story brought back memories of my childhood. My mother was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic and institutionalized when I was 7 years old.I highly recommend this book. It does have some &quot;mild profanities&quot; such as &quot;jeez&quot; and &quot;God&quot; (used litely in the beginning, but it turns into a heart felt prayer) Scholar Finds True Self I was utterly fascinated by the author's transformation. At the start of the book we meet Donald McCloskey, a noted economist, as well as husband, father, and professor. We also learn that he is a compulsive cross dresser who walks around casually in women's clothing and heavy make up--at home. In his 50s, Donald had a major life epiphany and decided to become a transsexual. He has \"the works\"---breast implants, electrolysis, facial feminization, female voice surgery, and sex reassignment surgery. The results are evident in the photographs (before and after) in the center section of the book. \"Deidre\" is a tall, blond, large-boned transsexual. Arms folded, legs crossed, \"Deirdre\" is not exactly my image of the womanly ideal. But judge for yourself.I found the author's literary style a bit unnerving. All those bold \"thoughts\" made me wonder who was speaking---Donald or Deirdre the Transsexual? The Economist is Transsexual American jokes often begin with &quot;You know that someone or something is ... if ...&quot; and the list goes on. I will not build up such a list on McCloskey's book, (anyway, I do not try to be funny either) but rather give you one personal reason why I loved it.The author, at first, convinces you that her crossing is truly a &quot;state of being&quot; and not what most of us would take as some sort of obscure fantasy. The reader is then &quot;sympathetic&quot; to her in the very first meaning of the word: I understand and I suffer with you, especially as things go wrong with her surgeries and with her family.But here come the mixed feelings: is she not responsible for being rejected by her wife and her children? For instance, was she not expecting too much from her daughter when signing &quot;Deirdre and Dad&quot; at the end of one letter ? Was &quot;Dad&quot; only not more appropriate to show that her new physical appearance changed nothing about the love she has for her daughter?At the end, the reader cannot help but ask himself where would he likely stands in all this and long after finishing the book he would think and think over it again. As for me, this is a sure way to recognize &quot;a great book&quot;.Finally, the book is well written and it is hard to skip a single page when you put both your mind and your feelings into it, which is surprisingly easy once you began to read it. A Great Book! This is a great read. There aren't many trannsexual memoirs as honest and riveting as McCloskey's whirlwind tour, from married heterosexual to avowed transsexual.My main complaint is straightforward. This memoir does not elaborate on contemporary scientific theories on the origins of transseuxality. Odd for a book that purports to be part memoir, part social science. I was hoping to find more information on autogynephilia--either an affirmation or denunciation of the concept. Where does McCloskey stand on this subject? He writes about gender as if it were disconnected from sex. How true is this in real life?Despite the book's inherent limitations, it's a great read and suitable for a general readership. A Good Read, Illustrative",

         "Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions",
         "I liked this book because it is true. Often times books about successful gambling ventures are annoying to me because it sounds as though the author is bragging and not much more. This book is different because it explains how the main character accomplished his goal. It explains how his hard work paid off and the mistakes he made along the way. It is funny to think that problem for these geniuses was not retaining the data like it would be for the average player, the trouble for them was carrying out the When I finished the book I felt more knowledgable about the casino industry and my own limitations in playing blackjack. If you don't know before you read, you will soon learn that blackjack is a game that can be beaten.Like some of the other reviewers I would like to see this book made into a movie. I would just hope that it maintained the emphasis on gambling rather than dramatize the vice. To stay true to the book they would need some actors of Asian decent to pull it off. I look forward to seeing it. Gambling, sex and violence: with an emphasis on gambling. Wife and I read it together in bed every night and couldn't put it down. Great writing, captivating, but if it weren't a true story - would be very ho-hum. You will absolutely love this book. Truly Amazing I dont think Mr. Mezrich is a very good writer, but he has toldan interesting story. (Mr. Mezrich is without doubt a better writerthan me, just not terribly good among writers whose booksI've read, imho). I like playing blackjack, and I have an idea howhard it is to count cards in a casino setting. No, I can't do iteffectively, but I don't believe it changes the odds as dramaticallyin the player's favor as the book describes. Still, I enjoyed\"Bringing Down the House\" as\"partial fiction\". Interesting, but...... Easily one of the most exciting books I've ever read. Every time I forced myself to put it down (all 3 times), I wanted to jump in the car and drive to Vegas. Must-read for anyone who's ever been to Vegas While Mezrich certainly had the makings of a great story (which really would be a wonderfully engaging movie, if he's not involved), he's awfully impressed with himself as a writer. I thought the chapters scattered in the book that tied the author to the story were really egotistical, and added very very little to the story. And we learn so little about these MIT students as either students or people that the dichotomy of their lives isn't as engaging as it perhaps should be. A story like this is entertaining to read, which earned it a star, and is almost too good to be true, which earns it another star. But whatever interest you have in this subject matter will be hardly satisfied by this book.Wait for the movie, they'd be stupid not to make one. Good story, badly told This is a truly amazing story of six MIT students who beat Vegas at its own game.As anybody who has ever been to Vegas knows, the ONLY game in Vegas where the player has a slight advantage (using minor card counting techniques) over the house is blackjack. The MIT students in this book took it a few steps further to increase their advantage even more. The research, practice, and other methods they used are quite remarkable. It certainly helped that they were all mathematical whizzes.This book is a lot more than just blackjack, though. It gives an inside glimpse into the life of a high roller (AKA whale in gambling jargon) and even has some suspense and intrigue.This is an absolute must read for anybody who has ever gambled in their life, especially if you've ever played a hand of blackjack. The book is a very fast read and you will find yourself turning the pages very quickly as you are enveloped in a fantasy world that only a handful of people ever get to realize.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED If you've ever played blackjack, this is a must read! (4.5 stars, actually)Over the past ten years, \"creative\" nonfiction has become quite popular, spurred in no small part by the success of John Berendt's \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\" among others. This book ought to serve as a paradigm for the genre: it reads like a novel, yet is based--and I use that term loosely--on fact.Mezrich pads the book a bit, stretching out the third-person narrative by splicing in first-person accounts of the background research he did. This is why I deducted a half star from the rating...this isn't a perfect book, but it's damned good anyway.Another flaw, and possibly an unavoidable one in this genre, is the amount of cinematic detail provided in the account. Nobody can accurately remember the vast amount of descriptive detail and dialogue put forth in the narrative; you know there's a good bit of authorial embellishment occurring when even the gestures of the characters are described with more detail than anyone can recall about what they had for lunch yesterday. But that's the nature of the beast: the book wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if Mezrich had followed the rules of Reporting 101 and stuck to the facts. Truth be told, I don't care if he spins the details out of thin air, as long as the gist is right. \"Creative\" nonfiction that delivers the goods. Mezrich's chronicle of the exploits of a gifted team of mathematicians is as compelling a morality tale as anything I have encountered recently. It is a quick read--very interesting. However, the book leads you to ponder the changes in the lives of the characters wrought by the easy money. The supposedly \"easy\" money comes at a terrible cost.Forget the fact that the casinos do not hesitate to use any necessary means in order preserve their advantage; forget that casinos give an unlimited budget to the detectives and surveillance necessary to snare the player who beats the house--regardless of the legality of the player's methods; forget the wildly successful forays of the MIT teams; as the reader gets behind the excitement of the story and the pleasure of seeing a few students exact huge gains from the casinos any conclusion must bear in mind that the portrayed lifestyle does not enrich the lives of the characters--even as it enriches their bank accounts. Though it was perhaps not the intent of Mr. Mezrich, a close reading of this book shows that the house still exacts its advantage.The moral lessons are universally applicable. In order to pursue their scheme, the prodigiously gifted mathematicians are required to adopt a facade of utter hedonism. However, it soon becomes clear that the lifestyle cannot be easily disengaged. We perceive that there is no free lunch--a significant price is being paid. I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I think that honesty is the best policy no matter whether the house deserves to be taken or not. It seems apparent that the no-holds-barred pursuit of money is ultimately worthless if not dangerous. Nothing is Free A good friend who doesn't read that much recommended this book to me -- he said he couldn't put it down. I'm afraid I couldn't either. Smart kids beating the house at blackjack seems like fiction...but this is non-fiction.And as it turns out, the book is about a lot more than how some card counting MIT grads beat Vegas...it's also a lot about how Vegas beats them and in the process helps the main character rise above the shallow riches of Vegas (or at least that's what he and Mezrich would have us believe).The story is certainly interesting, and becomes more than a mere re-telling with Mezrich's skillful construction, particularly his insertion of himself into the story in a way which makes you feel as though any one -- including you -- could be a card-counter for a day. You can be a card counter too... This is a heavily reviewed and popular book for good reason. I assume it's very close to being completely true and it's an easy to read, highly entertaining little book.I think if you have any interest in the question about whether or not players can beat the house at blackjack, you will fill this book enlightening. The author does a very good job of delivering the story in a readable fashion that keeps your interest. The tension of the players' situation as they are identified as counters by casino security people is also expressed well in this book. I expect it will make an outstanding movie. Entertaining story As a physician I have my fill of non-fiction with an abundance of journals so when I read for relaxation I want a story that keeps me excited, interested and sleepless until it is finished. Bringing Down the House is such a book and reads like a Clancy or Pollock with a little lower body count, but with no less excitement.Ben Mezrich is superb writer and story teller with the amazing ability to weave the excitement of a Las Vegas casino, the mathmetics of card counting with enjoyable interpersonal dynamics so that this is a consuming story with people you care about. His description of the high roller lifestyle in Vegas takes you to the tables playing sums you watch others wager with the adrenaline rush like you were part of the team. I bought the book in Boston having just missed him at a book signing and had a hardtime finishing the conference. I found myself in the room reading a book I could not put down instead of going out in one of the towns in which the story was set. It was that engrossing.My Christmas list now contains all of his previous writings as this is an author who knows how to tell a story. Cardiac meds needed for Mezrich's thrilling ride I don't read much since it's hard to find something that keeps me interested. I couldn't put this down! It's an amazing story, especially considering it's true. I didn't think there would be much suspense to the story, but man was I wrong. The way the author tells it, he hints at something that could be coming, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I loved it. For those looking to buy a book to learn how to count cards...this isn't it! This isn't even really a book about basic strategy. They talk about it VERY little since it's needed for the story, but the book is focused on the journey of one young man (20s for most of the book...my age) through Vegas, Atlantic City, and finding himself and his place in the world.I can't recommend this book enough. I loved it! Fantastic book...one of my favorites! This book has spurred TV specials and recieved many rave reviews. After getting sucked into one of the many TV specials talking about counting cards and beating Vegas I decided to look into the issue and this book, as I had heard, was the `one' to read. While reading the book I found that it was extremely hard to put down and that I essentially had goose bumps imagining the pure brilliance of these college kids.The book is absolutely amazing, the story of 6 brilliant MIT students who are taught by a math professor how to count cards and pass these counts to other teammates unknown to security and other casino personnel. Counting the 312 cards included in the 6 deck shoe and getting an accurate count is unbelievable. The book goes into great detail explaining all of the members of the team. The reason a one man team would be impossible to pull off is because raising your bet after the cards got hot, and lowering the betting as the cards cooled off, would be seen as very suspicious to the dealer and you would be made known to security. Using an intricate team is how millions of dollars were made.The first member of the team will start out at the table placing the minimum bet every single hand while counting cards (A high card, 9 -Ace, counts as -1, while a low card, 2-6, counts as +1. Thus a high count means that many low cards have been drawn out of the shoe leaving many high cards). This team member is generally dressed very modestly and doesn't draw too much attention to themselves. After the count gets `hot' this member will call in the big spender. The big spender is the gambler who attracts all the attention, wearing extravagant clothing and betting large sums of money on nearly every hand. After the big spender is seated the count must be passed, the most crucial part of the entire operation. The passing of the count has to be done without the two teammates acknowledging each other. Let's say that the count is +8, after a few hands of them both at the table the minimum better will leave the table making a comment to the dealer such as, `Well I think my luck is about up, I'm going to go hang out by the pool for a while.' The word pool is not in reference to the casinos swimming pool but actually the game of pool in which the 8 ball is commonly associated. With that simple comment the teammates never look at each other while passing very vital information that is nearly undetectable to the dealer or the casinos high tech security equipment, pure brilliance.The true art of counting cards is to count cards while being so animated, or seemingly uninterested in the cards that in seems to the untrained eye that you not actually counting cards. Although counting cards is not technically illegal it is not something that casinos permit. Games that are located in casinos are to the house advantage but once that advantage swings the way of the gamblers, the casino will do all that is in its powers to have that individual removed. Once a card counter is caught they are generally asked to leave the premises and are banned for life.This book is something that is for everyone, a good way to pass time on a plane trip or a great book to read on vacation to get your blood pumping. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading thrillers, or books that show the underdog consistently beating the heavy favorite, because after all, how can you not root for the underdog?Brian Bowen David:Goliath::College Whiz's:Vegas. How can you not root for the underdog? I was recommended this book by my sister and kind of blew off her recommendation. Finally I was in a bookstore and ran across the book, picked it up and purchased it. When I got home I sat down and dove into the first chapter. But after every chapter it seemed foolish to put the book down because it was so good, and I thought, well written. The book does read like fiction, but that is what amazes me - reading about a lifestyle that should exist only in movies. Backrooms, PIs, cheating, deception, VIP suites, people losing over 100 Grand in 2 hands, absolutely amazing stuff. Couldn't Put It Down A previous review suggested that only 60% of the story is true. I chime in only to tell you unequivocally that the story is 100% true, although some things have been left out. How do I know? I was on the team a long time ago.I was surprised that they gave away as much information as they did, because I would think that some are still employing the system in a slightly altered form. If you're curious, because the list in the book stops at 18, the words for 20 and 21 were cigarettes (20 in a pack) and beer (the legal drinking age). I think it may have been a better read to embellish a little or to include some relevant non-blackjack stories involving the members, but as written it is all true. It's all true A reviewer below who gave this book 5 stars noted that it is a dramatization based on real events. There is a label for those types of books--fiction. It bothers me tremendously that this book is billed as non-fiction and was listed on non-fiction bestseller lists. As soon as it became obvious to me that the book was fiction (which should happen very quickly if you approach the book with any sort of a critical perspective), it became difficult for me to enjoy the book. If you can suspend disbelief and are interested in a story based on events the general framework of which I'm sure are true, then you will probably find this to be a quick, entertaining read. Fiction Bringing Down the House is an entertaining and quick read. Guided by the experience of a rebel professor and a former \"dinosaur\" card-counter, a small group of MIT students put an old counting theory to play at major casinos across the country. The underlying principle behind card counting is that a deck rich is tens, face cards and aces is favorable for the player, whereas a deck rich in small cards is good for the dealer. To gauge the richness of the deck in good cards, the player will keep track of the cards that have already been played by assigning a point value to each of them. Thus, the MIT team assigns a value of +1 to 3, 4, 5, and 6, and -1 to tens, face cards and aces. Everything else is 0, or neutral. At the beginning of a deck or shoe the count is 0; then the counter constantly adds and subtracts from the count according to the cards played. Under the scrutiny of the \"Eye in the Sky\" - the dealers, pit bosses and casino managers - keeping track of a deck position and then taking advantage of a highly positive count seems quite challenging. Mezrich makes it unequivocal that the average person cannot accomplish what the MIT team did - and in the process reveals in detail comic team gimmicks to avoid being caught by the house. A truly high-adrenaline read if you have the slightest interest in Blackjack! &iexcl;Vegas atenci&oacute;n! Beating the casinos at blackjack certainly must have been an exciting experience for the MIT team. I was extremely jealous of what they did in Las Vegas and in other casinos elsewhere.The book was interesting since it wasn't entirely a narration of the MIT team's experience. It also includes narration by the author in first person when he meets with some of the people who were involved in one way or another with the team.By the end of the book, I was able to appreciate the fact that I wasn't involved with the MIT team, although it didn't all end on a bad note. Would the experience they went through be worth it for the money and the memories? I'd say so. It certainly was fun while it lasted. You will be jealous! This is a somewhat entertaining book that might have rated four stars if it were true. Under no circumstances would this book be rated five stars--it is just not that well written. Now that the movie is out, which itself plays fast and loose with the contents of the book in order to entertain us (since the goal in the movies is rarely truth), the book's veracity is getting more attention. Read the other negative reviews here as a starting point. Then read the article in the Ideas section of today's Boston Globe Ideas section. A synoposis--the author plays fast and loose with reality, and many of the people involved with the team don't recall many of the 'facts' the author claims they were involved with. One glaring example is a team member being beaten up by casino goons. It apparently never happened, but certainly makes for exciting narrative, doesn't it? If you want an engaging story, it might be worth reading. If you want non-fiction, look elsewhere. More stars if he had correctly identified it as highly fictionalized. Great Story! keeps you intrigued on what happens next and how they beat the house! highly recomended Great Book As a successful high stakes 21 player of more than 20 years in Las Vegas, it saddens me to have to read this misleading book. There are so many exaggerations and improbabilities compared with the reality that I felt compelled to speak out...This may be fine as ficiton. Long time Las Vegas pro says this book is exaggerated hokum Good thriller with plenty of action to keep the story moving. One minor issue I have is that the author time shifts a lot, jumping ahead of the story for one chapter, then jumping back to it. I really find this annoying, but others may not mind it. Good read, but when are we? In Bringing Down The House, Ben Mezrich tells the true story of a group of MIT students who count cards in blackjack. The story focuses on Kevin Lewis, and how he came to be an expert card counter. At no time is this story dull or boring. It will keep you into it until the very end. The story itself is unbelievable, which makes the book even more amazing. Mezrich does a great job of describing the thoughts and actions that each student took during the book. He also does a good job on showing each character's growth and development during the book. Kevin starts off the story as a shy Asian kid who is not happy with his job at the lab. Once his friends Martinez and Fisher show him the amazing world of counting cards, Kevins life turns completely different. The Las Vegas highlife and huge amounts of money turn Kevin into a completely different person. His change during the book is smooth and very believable. This is the kind of book that you will pick up and wont be able to put down. It's an easy and a very fun read. It will show you a different side of Vegas and a different side of Blackjack. Mezrich shows how difficult card counting really is and how much hard work it is to master it. Kevin and his team went out nearly every weekend to Vegas to count cards. Their lives in Las Vegas completely overshadowed their lives at home. Not only did the team spend almost every weekend in Las Vegas, but they had to keep their double lives secret from all their family and close friends. The team counted for over a year. Spending that much time together, there must be some problems they encounter. If you read this book I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. Interesting and Amazing This has got to be one of the most intriguing non-fiction books of all time. It's basically how a group of MIT students combine together and take millions from major Casinos. Using team play, sound probability, expert training, and skill, they do the impossible and create havoc for the Casinos, and later themselves.This book describes it all, and yes, it's better than any made up story a fiction writer could produce. Mezrich describes how Kevin Lewis became involved in what later became a lifestyle of glamor, big money, and even woman. Kevin goes from a geeky swimmer at MIT to a big player winning big money.Mezrich knows how to weave the story. First he discusses the introduction, then the frightening orientation. He delves into the mathematics, the strategy, and how the teammates fit into what character roles. He shows how intricate the team aspect of blackjack works, and how they capitilized on it. Both seedy and genious, it sheds a whole new life on blackjack and casino gambling.After that, he then starts showing how Casinos work, especially how they treat you when you're a big player versus when you're a card counter. Without giving too much away, this story not only deals with the winning, but also with the repercussions. Mezrich brings into the lifestyle, not only with the glamor, but also the suspense and terror that accompanies it.This books is one of those few books that you cannot put down. It's a great story and most importunely, a great eye-opener. To top it off, it's all true.No one who reads this will be able to gamble the same way again. No exaggeration. Just pick up this book. I bet you can't put it down (terrible pun intended). David versus Goliath mixed with cards and mathematics 21: Bringing Down the House - Movie Tie-In: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millionsmy review for the book is excellent. and this was my first time using amazon and i was very pleased. Bringing down the house This book is fast, exciting, and jaw dropping. I kept having to remind myself that this was a true story - that this actually happened! Ben Mezrich does a great job of recreating the story of Kevin Lewis and all of the other genius card counters. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to gamble, loves Vegas, is itching to learn more about the high-roller lifestyle, or simply enjoys a good story. Thanks Ben! Awesome Read! This true story really takes you into the hair raising lifestyle of Vegas, and then propels you into the blackjack world and the realities of getting caught at counting cards. Hell of a read, makes me want to learn to count cards. Superb Read What a great read, i read it cover to cover in 3 nights. Fast paced and informative, to put it simply it made me want to play some black jack... buy it... no wait; buy 2, get one for your friend. FANTASTIC It was a easy read, interesting - I had seen the movie prior to reading this book and so I knew the story. Liked the development of the characters in the book better than the attempt in the movie, fast paced, very understandable.Good story. Book review from grandson's perspective This story is amazing, the story has inspired me to try my hand at counting. Anyone interested in learning to count cards need to try out \"Real Deal Blackjack: Learn to Count\" software. http://www.realdealblackjack.com . If not interested in counting or blackjack this is still an awesome story. action packed - can't miss I started reading it during a short plane ride and continued reading it after I got home that day until I finished. It is a fast,interesting read about very smart kids trying to beat the system. I loved it and recommend it to anyone who loves vegas! Could not put it down!! It was a decent read but very much overhyped by a lot of people; this book was even recommended to me as amazing by someone I later discovered hadn't even read it! There's not nearly as much extravagance, action, or suspense one might expect considering the reviews. Of course real life isn't like Hollywood, but then to be fair it shouldn't be billed as such. In the end this book was mediocre in that I didn't feel affected in any way by it. Decent Book Hard to believe this really happened. Even for the Math-challenged, the strategy was well explained and seems plausible. This is not a plot-driven story, its more of an account retold in 3rd person with great research and interviews mixed in for cred. The author is not the most gifted writer, but does a great job making this a fun and light read...hard to put down. There are some unanswered questions at the end of the novel. I guess because it is non-fiction, we'll never know some aspects such as the casino's side of the story. Can this really be nonfiction? As the author ofMake Money for Casino Gambling: How to Acquire a Gambling BankrollI can tell you this is the dream of all advantage gamblers. After you establish your gambling bankroll, you hope to go on a winning streak such as these MIT students did and what a streak it was.Some have questioned the authenticity of a few of the details in the book, but that doesn't really concern me as long as the overall story is true, which it seems to be. Several MIT students formed a card counting blackjack team and won millions from casinos, that's all I need to know and I'm hooked.Great story, gives all aspiring card counters and advantage gamblers a dream to hold onto. I've enjoyed most of Mr. Mezrich's work, I hope he continues to write about gambling. The Card Counter's Dream Book was like new and delivered as promised. Great book for a great price. Very easy transaction. Thank you! Great price for a great book! I am the type of person who usually isn't motivated to read, but it was hard to put this book down. Only complaint was that I got many of the people confused sometimes, I could nonetheless follow along. Hard to Put Down Despite recent allegations of factual inaccuracies and narrative exaggerations, most prominently in a recent Boston Globe article, Mezrich still cranks out a thoroughly engaging read. I finished this book in five days, which is fast for me, especially considering I had a major paper due on the fifth day. This book is compelling, although not the most well-written work I have ever come across. The prose is adequate, no more, no less. The lead characters are reasonably well-developed, but again, there is substantial room for improvement in that regard. The hook is the story, which draws you in even if you are not a gambler.Even considering that certain events and characters are fabricated to varying degrees, plotting is \"Bringing Down the House's\" greatest strength. The story moves quickly and believably. As Mezrich points out numerous times, card counting is not illegal, so casino bosses can't have you arrested and won't physically harm you if you get caught. Unlike in the unfaithful movie adaptation \"21,\" the worst that will happen to you is that you will get thrown out of the casino and eventually blacklisted. No running through kitchens away from vengeful security guards or any such nonsense like that - maybe twenty or thirty years ago your health and safety would be in jeopardy, but not today or even in the 1990s, which is when the book is set. Mezrich is smart enough to not try to convince you otherwise; the producers of \"21\" are not (he also didn't include a pointless romance with the main character and one of the female players). Even in the sole scene when one of the players does get assaulted (not by a casino security guard), it is presented in a way that doesn't stretch credibility, even though it never actually happened. The same can be said for the book's denouement, which is also largely fictionalized.While it should be noted that the group of MIT students in this book are not the progenitors of the card-counting techniques or team strategies to \"beat Vegas,\" that doesn't change the fact that their story is still quite interesting. One serious issue I take with this book is that the non-fiction label is questionable; putting a vague disclaimer at the book's beginning does not justify the kinds of manipulations performed on the existing material. Nevertheless, despite its numerous problems with authenticity; writing style, which is a bit flaccid; and characterizations, some of which are a little generic, it's a quick read that is worthwhile, if not entirely rewarding. Not exactly great literature, but still a solid read Bringing Down the House is probably the most entertaining book I have read in a long time. I actually found it difficult to put down. When I should have been sleeping I instead continued reading saying to myself &quot;this is the last chapter then i'm going to bed&quot;.I've always had a great interest in gambling and have read many books on card counting as well as heard a little about what this team did in Vegas. When I saw the title I knew I had to give this one a read. I have fairly decent understanding of the many mainstream concepts of blackjack strategy and what this team did was purely brilliant and outside of the common beliefs that Vegas and many pro gamblers (the ones who write books about it) want you to believe. An example, casinos would love to make you think that its impossible to count or beat a 6 deck shoe. In reality this is completely untrue. 1 deck might be easy to count, but you generally only get 1 or 2 rounds of play out of it so when the numbers run to your favor you only have one hand to take advantage of it. When the shoe runs positive, the cards can go several rounds before they flatten out. There are of course many other factors involved such as how deep into the stack the dealer puts the shuffle card, etc.To any gambling enthusiast this is a must read. To anyone who is neutral on gambling, it is a story that is easy to follow and very intriguing. If you hate gambling and everything it stands for, you might not like it. An incredible story \"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\" is a delicious look at unlikely winners.I'm no great fan of gambling, and see what gambling boats are doing to lower the quality of living as they creep up around Chicagoland. Hence, I derive great pleasure from reading about how a few smart kids beat Las Vegas at its own game.Statistically based on finding suckers and losers, casinos 'always' win. And, if you discover a way to beat a casino, you get kicked out. The only ones to stay are those who won because of luck, not smarts (because the house knows they're likely to lose it all). MIT is known for bringing in and graduating kids who know math about as well as math could be known. Usually, the school is asociated with cranking out thick-glasses, math-geek gerbils who spin the wheels of science. They are more likely to win Nobel prizes than blackjack. Still, they are smarter than most of us, and really aren't the thin stereotype we imagine.This story has so many angles to enjoy. The underdog winning. The geek beating the tough guys. Basic math and quick thinking winning. And of course, these kids are doing what most of won't do: win a boatload of money.Let's bring DeNiro, Hoffman, and some other great stars together, as well as a few of the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" crowd to get a made-for-TV movie going. I'd watch it.I fully recommend \"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\" by Ben Mezrich. It is worth gambling a few bucks to buy the book.Anthony Trendl What a Pleasure! the book was naturally a lot more detailed than the movie. they changed a lot about the characters in the movie. if you read the book and then watch the movie afterwords, you will probably be disappointed. better than movie I found the story to be captivating and enjoyable. I was surprised at what a quick read it was. I read it in about 5 hours. But it made for a great read in one day at the beach. Don't expect deep plot lines or twists and turns, just a fun and fairly light account of a fascinating world. Great long-weekend read I saw Ben Mezrich on CNBC promoting this book so I figured I'd give it a shot. Man, what an intelligent, fast-paced, tale. I'd recommend this book to anyone. . .No Joke. I totally didn't expect to love this this book--But I did!!",

         "Best book I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time! A timeless classic and highly recommended (must) read. Couldn't put it down. Haven't read through it all yet, but so far, I can't leave it.I guess everyone who appreciates pure writing work should read it. Great classic Enjoyed but all purchased books should be have the ability to be sent to another Kindal Fire and I am dissatisfied with that aspect Good This classic (yes I coin the phrase out of my own true feelings about the book - not because it is old) sincerely touched me and found me out to be a romance reader after avoiding such themes as much as possible. The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC. A Wonderfully Wordy and Worldy Classic... I read Jane Eyre for my AP Lit. Class in the 12th grade. I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-) Without A Doubt The Best Novel Ever Written Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine. A Masterpiece that Transends Generations There is no more a heart wrenching story as this of love, pride, and principles. The greatest of these themes being love. Amazing More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther. Epitomizes its genre Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16. A timeless romance This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over. I love this book! Definitely a keeper. The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies. Love this book! Loved it! I read it in seventh grade. My English teacher gave it to me as a present and I have cherished it since. I still have that copy, in good condition. The novel was wordy and yet not boring. The book to me was not only a classic but beyond what words can describe. I'm in 11 grade and I've read it about five times. I still cry whenever I read it. longest historical romance i've ever read Aa profound story of service dedication,.determination( or stub- borness) and love written in beautiful and descriptive prose.A delightful. Challenge to my French vocabulary skills.., Refreshing and soothing. I love this book. I probably first read it when I was 15. Since then I read it 3 or 4 times and each time I could't put book away until very late at night. Certainly my favorite love story. I would say that this book is more for younger ladies and I am not expecting too many young man to read it. My favorite! Now this was a real surprise - a &#34;classic&#34; that was worth reading. Okay so I came to it in a very round about way, having seen the recent film, and then read &#34;The Eyre Affair&#34; by Jasper Fforde (clearly missing out on much of the fun there through my ignorance!) but this was a good read. Compared to the horror and suffering of reading Pride & Prejudice, Jane Eyre was a character who I cared about. Jane Eyre i normally dont go for the books that take alot of thinking but this book is now one of my favorites. it is a perfect combination of romance and mystery. for sure a great read i highly recomend! woderful book This novel descends through such a passage if time, society and religious bounty that it never ceases to surprise me at how poignant it is. Love and human connection of so many a variety root this novel into deep soil that will always remain relevant. This was a refreshing re-read, and an excellent version for the kindle. Jane Eyre It was my first time reading this classic and truly loved this book. The first quarter of the book was a little slow to get into. Afterwards, I could not put the book down. Jane and Mr. Rochester's love story is one of the best from the classics. The climax and the final reveal are certainly worth the hundreds of pages. We can learn from Jane's journey from an orphan girl to an independent woman even today in the 21st century. Definitely not a Cinderella story but that's probably what makes it so great to read. Highly recommended to all readers! A Timeless Classic I particularly like Miss Bronte's use of words to describe natural scenes. I refer to her descriptions of out door scenes. However I did become bored with her lengthy and imaginary conversations with her admirers which accounts for the low rating.I have seen this book described as an auto biography. That cannot be so. Perhaps the early part was written from her actual experiences but this book was finished long before she was married to the curate, not Rochester.I am beginning to realize that this was in fact the Victorian style of writing. Some lovely passages in between rather dreary writing. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month. It is a book I had not read since I was in high school. Now I can't believe that at one time I plowed my way though the extravagant prose, it must have been because the selection of other romance books was limited.Our edition was large print, for which I was thankful and as a recommendation I'd suggest a condensed version.Writing style have changed since 1848, but one item of interest. Early in the book Miss Bronte describe the characteristics of the development of a serial killer as graphically as any modern thriller.Nash Black whose titles are available in Amazon Kindale editions.HaintsSins of the FathersWriting as a Small Business A Visit With the Past I have read this book a few times now and it is still wonderful. There is so much I still pick up on when I read it. Classic Charlotte Bronte created quite an admirable heroine. Jane Eyre is, without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Also, the love story has a modern quality that tells the reader that this book was ahead of its time.As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre had to endure many adversities in order to secure her status as a governess in the home of Mr. Rochester, a temperamental man with a dark secret -- a secret that could destroy the powerful bond he'd had with Jane Eyre.This novel has revolutionized romantic fiction; it has influenced many writers. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite heroines; I will always admire her courage and independence. I applaud Charlotte Bronte for having invented such an unforgettable character. Jane Eyre has found a special place in my heart -- and on my bookshelf! Jane Eyre I had ordered two DVD's of Jane Eyre. Both are good, but the one has scenes in it what the other doesn't.Also diaologues. As the book I had was shortened for school reading, I wanted to have the complete book.That is what I have now and it pleases me very much.I have read it already 4 times and still am.I am happy with it. Happy with Jane Eyre Jane Eyre is a novel that captures the reader. It is about a young girl who experiences the hardships of everyday life. Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading. Jane Eyre Great Teen Reading So glad I re-read this classic. Reading it 40 years after the first time opened my eyes to aspects of history and the beauty of this classic that I didn't see the first time. Wonderful book This book is amaizing. It's the ideal book for any romantic who thinks love is something of the past. Jane Eyre is a homely governess who falls in love with the master of the house. Jane has come from very good family, but because of a someone pain in the butt aunt, is sent to away to boarding school. The story is quite simple actually. Homely girl meets rich man. Homely girl entices rich man with innocence and natural beaty. Rich man dumps blond for homely girl. I'm not going to pretend that every word in this book kept you wanting more, it actually took me close to 200 pages to get interested, but its well worth the wait!!!! Jane is sent from her aunts house to live at a boarding school. She is brave and outspoken after living with her aunt after her mothers death and is not quite welcomed with open arms at her new home. Her only friend dies a short time after Jane's arrival and life isn't everything Jane wanted. She completes school and stays for several years to be a teacher herself. She responds to an ad in the paper about a governess. She is given the position and begins to work for the man she falls in love with. A homely girl and a rich man. Enough said. I first read this in college, and didn't fully appreciate it at the time. But I have since read it several other times, and it has become a treasured favorite. Even better upon re-reading I usually read murder mysteries but ordered the audiobook after viewing the Brontes' sisters biography on television. It's a wonderful book. I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books. Delightful reading Found this to be a descriptive and moving tale of love, hardship, faith, and perseverance. Better than the movie. Enjoyable Classic I gather this is required reading at a lot of high schools these days, and I'm sure that a lot of today's high schoolers do indeed think of it as a drag. It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story. It doesn't HAVE to be a drag.... Words cannot describe the adoration I have for this book, if ever you were going to read a classic this is a must! Truly strong interesting characters. Lovely and heartfelt story. This book still sparks my interest every time I read it... The Character Jane Eyer is humble and strong, admirable and unforgettable! My absolute all time favorite book! Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" is one of the best literary works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in. In my opinion, \"Jane Eyre\" is a must read! A Timeless Classic! This was a Book club suggestion. Still reading, long book but a great classic. The French words are a little difficult. Jane Eyre I read this book thinking it would be lame because its so old. I read it in less than three days. I LOVED this book. The only thing is that upset me was she is my opposite. Her actions would have been way different if i was her. The ending is ok and I wish it was different. I love mr. r he sounds like a pretty good looking man if you ask me. So if I were u read it you`ll love it. Thats why I gave it five stars. This book is awsome!! I recommend that all girls and women read the classics of the Brontes. They are rich in writing styles you don't experience in newer books. Wonderful stories and set in times in history that results in an educational experience as well as a great story. Jane Eyre I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \"I just don't understand how people can like this book\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star! So much better than I remember from high school! I am concurrently reading &#34;The Brontes: Wild Genius on the Moors. The story of three sisters&#34; and took a &#34;time out&#34; from the biography to re-read all of Jane Eyre. I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books. As good as ever This is, hands down, one of my favorite books. It is not the typical romance story - the heroine is not a gorgeous, delicate, flower and the hero is not a young, virile Hercules. The characters are more realistic, allowing the reader to be more sympathetic. Jane Eyre is described as being the plainest of the plain, but her strength and independence make her a rare individual. She is a dynamic character whose love transforms her in the end.This is book really moved me. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially anyone who has the time to read it in one or two settings and not have to worry about writing a paper on it. It'll be worth your time! One of the most unique and beautiful love stories After seeing the movie several times, decided I should read this classic. I'm surprised I never have read it before. It is wonderfully written! A beautiful classic! A classic for a reason. EVERY woman should read this book! Jane's strength of character and respect for herself is an example to all. Bravo, Jane! Bravo, Jane! I just finished reading this book and am still in shock of how excellant it was. I am normally not that emotional about books, but at the end of this book, I sobbed. How wonderful that true love conquered all. It is a magnificent book that all women should read. A hopelessly romantic book! One of the most delicious books I have ever read. Bronte's command of the words she uses to paint a picture are exquisite. My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed! Charlotte Bronte's writing is like food for the soul! while it's really cheap, the words are very small and there is almost no space between lines...I would rather just pay a few bucks more and have a more pleasant reading experience. words are small I enjoyed picking up Jane Eyre to pass the time while traveling. Charlotte was very detailed in her description of Jane's life. It is a slowly evolving saga which reminds me of the kinds of things that still go on in life today. It was good and am glad to be able to move on to another! Facts of Life I read Jane Eyre for the first time in my early 30's. I could not put it down. It is one of those few books where the author's voice gets in your head. I recently downloaded it so that I could revisit it. A marvelous book for anyone. A book to get lost in Excellent story. The Bronte sisters came up with some amazing stories. Look forward to reading more stories narrated by the character of the story. Great writing style. Excellent that this book is available to read for free too. Great read The story begins with Jane Eyre being tormented by her cousins. She is soon sent to Lowood School, a very strict school. There she grows up and even becomes one of the teachers. She soon decides to go out into the world. She is hired by Mr. Rochester to take care of his daughter, Adele. As Jane teaches Adele, she falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When a friend of his prevents their marrige, Mr. Rochester begs her to become his mistress. Throughout it all, Jane remains firm in her belief of pure love and marriage. Though she loves Mr. Rochester, she refuses to lower herself to adultrey. As life becomes unbearable there, she sets off to find herself and to seperate herself from her love.She soon finds that no matter how many miles she puts between herself and Mr. Rochester, she cannot forget him. A classic that hooks you in the first few chapters Talk about a beautifully written book ! Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words. Read the book, and let Charlotte Bronte describe it to you in her eloquent and heart rendering prose. In one word...\"WOW\" !!! Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre was truly an enjoyable novel for me to read. Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life. Jane Eyre - Timeless and Enjoyable I did not read this novel for school or for a book club; just for my pure enjoyment and did I ever enjoy it! I was a little intimidated by some of the reviews saying it was a 'romance novel' which I can't stand...but after reading it I realize, \"Yes, it is a romance novel but also a mystery and many other things!\" I am very surprised that I liked it or even bothered reading it everyday but to tell you the truth it is suspensful and intriguing. There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone! An AMAZING Classic! As a child I did not understand a lot of the book, but,having read it at least 12 times over the years, I continue to find new meanings in each reading. FIRST READ 57years ago. If I read it in high school, I don't remember it. I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library! This is a classic! It was incredible to have access to a novel our children are required to read. Thank you for making it free! appreciate it. Jane Erye Like all great literature JANE EYRE can be read again and again revealing new truths and raising fresh questions. For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment. Love Conquers All I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \"classics,\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name) The classic I'm always happy to read I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end. Great book, not recommended for required school reading Very old fashioned and, for some, I suppose difficult to read due to the antiquated dialog - but a gem worth sticking with! Like Jane Austin, Charles Dickens and all their contemporaries, there is a very good reason that these classics are still widely read even by those of us not in need of a good grade in English Lit. It's because they are wonderfully intricate and well told tales, fabulous stories for those of us hungry for the next line, the next challenge and the next twist of fate. The Book is ALWAYS better than any film, so read this instead of downloading the old Orson Welles film to get all the nuances the writer intended... then definitely watch the film too! Classic for a reason I bought this for a friend, and she and I both loved it. It is small but very pretty. Beautiful little book This book is such a wonderful read! It was a bit slow for the first 100 pages or so, but still good to read. I just caution people who love good love stories to stick with it if they find it slow. One of my favorites of all time! This wonderful story should be read at the very least every 10 years or so, starting in adolescence. Your feelings about this story, especially Rochester, will change every time you read it.Adolescence: Why does Jane love him, he's so old!20's: Jane, MUST you flee temptation?30\"s: Run, Jane, Run!: Perhaps Rochester DROVE Bertha to the looney bin!40's: Rochester improves on acquaintance--Masculine, Moody and Magnificent! (A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact. As a modern woman I respect this character's moral uprightness and her strong sense of self--I wish more modern young (and not so young) women would learn from her example, and thus avoid much heartache and regret\"Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.'--Mr. Rochester Your feeling for Jane Eyre will change everytime you read it. So glad I chose to read this classic again. Wish there had been an audio option when I read it the first time...35+ yrs ago! CliffsNotes didn't do it, me, or my grade any justice. with audio +++ I took up this book because I had heard it spoken of, and I was curious. It was well written and well narrated. Beautifully written Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester... I KNEW IT WS HIM!!! and when she finds out he ******** ( dont wanna ruin anything!)and i was like... woa...wow...no way... and then they all ******* ( oh, there i go again, i'm horrible!)i thought it was allvery interesting.i recomend this book to someone who likes to read. and someone whos interesed in england in the 1800's, or even someone who likes love stories.i think anyone would like i really.BYE! its past my bed time. Amy's Review on Jane Eyre It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. I am Jane Eyre Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, published under the pen name of Currer Bell. Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years. Described as a classic, it is easy to see why Jane Eyre is one of the most unforgettable of English novels. unforgettable classic I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \"best earthly companion\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love. A classic in a perfect device The story of Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a search for human compassion. From the tragedies of her orphaned beginnings and a childhood with a hateful aunt who, out of spite, sends Jane to a prison-like life at Lowood Boarding School, Jane's strength of character shines through. Through each ordeal the reader develops a true concern for this \"plain Jane\". When she finally begins to find a more content life at Thornfield and as her relationship with Rochester develops into love the reader feels happiness for her, but follows her through the depths of despair at the shocking revelation that prevents her from marrying him. The reader cheers for her as she rebuilds her life as a strong, independent woman who is able to choose her destiny.Jane Eyre is a beautifully written book, although at times Charlotte Bronte's descriptions were very wordy and therefore the reading process was difficult. Understandably, this descriptive style of writing was typical of an era in which the average person did not have the opportunities we now have to envision different people and places. A Search for Human Compasion Charlotte Bronte knew what she was doing! While at times a bit more descriptive than I like, Jane Eyre tells a fascinating story of love, secrets, and duty. It is a timeless story and a worthy read. One of My Favorite Love Stories One of my old favorites...nice to visit it again. It's great that classics like this are available for FREE on the Kindle. Can't beat FREE This is one of the greatest classic in literature, the only downside is that it is a little long. You will really need some time to get through this one. Classic I've read Jane Eyre many times over the years, but this time on my Kindle. It is a wonderful story with strong characters. The Kindle is helpful when reading older books because you can use the built-in dictionary to look up obscure, archaic words. Many classics are touted as \"must reads\". Jane Eyre is a must read book, but is also a very engrossing and enjoyable read. Jane Eyre is a wonderful classic. How many good things can I say about Jane Eyre. This for me is the most perfect book ever made and I will read it a hundred more times in my life. Charlotte Bronte is my hero! My favorite book ever made If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school! Classic for Young Women and Christians I can't exactly remember how many times I have read this novel, but every time I do, I fall in love all over again. From the mysterious noise coming from the upstairs room of Thornfield Hall to the growing love between Jane and her employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane Eyre is an enchanting story of a young girl orphaned at a young age and living with 3 horrible little children and their mother. Jane is treated like a outsider and a burden by the eldest son. When Jane is old enough to leave that life behind, and start over,she becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall. Each night Jane hears a strange noise that frightens her, and spends most of the novel uncovering a secret that could affect her relationship with Rochester in a way she could never imagine. absolute favorite novel! When I saw this in the listing I had to have it. It's one of those books I can read all the time, watch on TV over and over. Of course reading it is better. Amazon delivers the books right away to my Kindle and I can keep it there for as long as I want. One of my favoite books! Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader. So deep and thought provoking This was an adorable little book that was very affordable. I loved the look and antique feel. The book mark was also a nice touch. cute little book I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story. Awesome Book Jane Eyre was slow at the start for me personally, but I grew engrossed in Jane's adventures and devoured the book earnestly. Wonderful Ok... so truth be told, I only started to read this book because of the movie \"Definately, Maybe\". The way the character in the movie described the book made me think I might like to read it. I was not disapponted. I find that some of the \"classics\" are a bit borning and hard to follow. This one was neither. The orphaned girl hated by her family finds love. And love finds her as well. But it wouldnt make for an interesting story if there werent hills to climb. Over all I would say that this is one of those classics that has most definately earned the classification. Glad I took a chance I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!! It is so wonderful! It is not hard to read like some classics. (ie, Tale of Two Cities) I fell in love with Jane and think about her all the time! I know, very silly. You won't be disappointed in this book. I can't believe I waited 35 years to read this! Recieved this book along with another book and 2 cds. Shipped really fast..Excellent book..a classic for all ages. Great book! Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, \"Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?\" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read. There's a Reason They Call It a Classic Jane Eyer is a great book, have read it before, will surely read it again, one of the great books Brilliant Book When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again. Jane Eyre You really can't go past Jane Eyre. Bronte has put so much thought and dedication into this novel. It is timeless, making it so easy to read even after all this time. True Classic I read this book when I was 13 for an English assignment in school. What can I say other than I loved it all? I when I got through half of the book I couldn't believe my luck that I still had 321 pages of adventures left. It was totally different from all the other books I've ever read -- it was shocking, it was romantic, it was haunting, it was disturbing, it was joyful... It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself. It had all different emotions and troubles, and Charlotte Bronte really wrote the book well, taking from her own life experiances. There have been sentences in the book that I have never been able to forget because of the energy and passion that the author wrote into them. \"Jane Eyre\" can be called a haunting tale about one young woman's conflict between two different worlds. This is certainly a read for everyone. Jane Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite. Critique of Jane Eyre Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. \"`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, `you have my full and free forgiveness'\" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. \"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love\" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. \"I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless\" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple \"no\" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery. Jane Eyre - A True Classic Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \"syrupy-ness\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while. this is what a romance should be... It's been nearly 27 years since I was forced to read a classic. This year I decided I wanted to read one. I couldn't have a made a better choice. As with many authors in her time she can go a little overboard with detail for my liking but this was a wonderful book and well worth every minute I spent reading it! A Great Read I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again. It's just that good. One thing I really like about this book is that Jane isn't pretty, at least not pretty like many other girls around her, and she isn't high class, but she can still have a wonderful life regardless! This is an awesome book and even if you've never read a book like this, try it, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Awesome Book I recently read this book, being bored in the summer. Little did I know that this novel would capture my attention and hold it steady for three days. The character development was excelent. I felt like I was going through the trials and tribulations with Jane. I wanted to walk up to her and tell her my opinion of what to do. The story winds in ways I didn't think possible. I would be half-way through and wondering what could happen next since there was so much book still left to read. The reading was slightly complicated for me and I would have to stop and ask my parents what this (or that)old english word meant. I think that any high school girl that wants to discover more about standing up for what you believe in should most definetly read this. One of my favorite novels of any I have ever read. A Freshman's View of Jane Eyre One of the greatest novels I have ever read. I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \"judgment and feeling\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \"good\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways. Brilliantly conceived and beautifully executed...an intellectual and emotional tour de force What do I even need to say about Jane Eyre? Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous. I was forever changed by this book. Probably why my standard for a man was raised so high...lol! Anyway, read it! You'll love it! Easily my most favorite book of ALL time! Charlotte Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \"Jane Eyre\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \"Jane Eyre\" doesn't come close to \"Wuthering Heights,\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written. A Brit Lit classic I first read this book when I was about 15 and I loved it. I love Mr Rochester and the playful way he has about acting with Jane. I loved the way their love was the perfect romantic love, not Mills and Boon but a more sedate, beautiful, mature love.As an afterthought though it has shaped my view of love and at 17 am shocked to find out that most people's idea of love is a prenup and till death to you part while I have a view of love as never part and don't need a prenup because you should love someone so much that you couldn't consider getting divorced. In short it screwed me up but it's a good book. A Romance to Last Through the Ages I did not realize the \"collector's library\" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read. Too small This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre. Great Gothic Romance Growing up I never took the opportunity to read many classics. (I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for. Don't miss out on this classic This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked. But I'm sure it has something to do with it being an electronic version. But, LOVE THIS BOOK! Excellent book The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well. A Cinderella Story I bought this as a gift for my mother. The clssics have always been in our house but all of her's are worn paperbacks, that are probably over 20 years old. So when I stumbled across these beautifully covered books I was so excited. I wanted to buy all of them and I hope they aren't a limited edition, because I would build a library of classics with these. The book comes with a built in bookmark and the cover is a perfect fit for this beautiful story! Simply Beautiful I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops! I've reviewed the audio book version available from Amazon's sister site Audible. Since I can't contribute to what's already been said about the original book, I'll leave this'wrong' review in place. A fresh experience i didn't think i was going to enjoy a classic but, i tried it anyway and it was great. i fell in love with all the characters. a must read. a must read I don't like being required to write these with a certain amount of words. That is what makes me not even give a review. It keeps saying there is a problem with my review! ARGH! great The outside of the book is a little dirty, which I don't like. However, I only paid a penny for this book and it came in a timely manner so I guess I can't complain Okay The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\"Ghostly happenings\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue! a Victorian genius in any language, but not for everyone Like I said in the title this is an almost perfect gothic novel. I don't know French (I understand German)and there are parts where French is spoken. This book is well written and the characters are colorful. Jane is a passionate character. She is also quiet, meek (in her own way), but has strong opinions in the book. Mr. Rochester is dark, miserable, and extremly moody. I disliked Adele because she is way too irritating and spoiled. Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole. Well, she did but it was a very light interogation. She took Mrs. Fairfax's word for everything. Some of the things she said would be worth checking out. It gives more mystery to the book. Almost Perfect Gothic Novel Jane Eyre is the story of an orphan girl and her adventurous journey through life. She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom. So while the story and writing are both tasteful, Jane Eyre can only be taken in small doses. Popcorn anyone? I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience! &quot;Poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;...and amazing I had no idea Jane Eyre was so good! Why didn't I read this years ago? And I loved reading it on my Kindle with the dictionary feature because I could look up the words I didn't know. Wow A very good classic read for a lazy rainy or cold day by a warm fireplace or curled up with a throw. A Classic My order got to me very quickly and in better condition than I was expecting. speedy and in good condition I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean. Would buy again without a doubt. Thanks great shape INTELLIGENT WRITING TO SAY THE LEAST. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE KINDLE FIRE WHERE I CAN HIGHLIGHTTHE WORDS I DIDN'T KNOW. JANE EYRE When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can. A classic gothic story What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better. A true classic. This Kindle edition leaves some things to be desired. Fifty seven years old and I had never read Jane Eyre. It was amazing! Loved reading it on my Kindle Fire and using the dictionary to learn the old English words. An oldie but goodie. Though she writes in the Austin era, Charlotte Bront's style is unique, more mysterious (and a little darker) and less predictable than many of Jane Austen's works.I enjoyed this book because it portrays a harsh, plain, conservative, hard-working girl (like me) in a setting and a story so unlike what I live in. Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it. I am always disappointed when I reach the end.I don't think I need to explain much more about why I like it. I think it is a very well-written book. If you think you will like it, you probably will. Unique Romance Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \"classic\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend \"Jane Eyre\" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint! A must-read for literature lovers and romantic souls Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it. Review of Jane Eyre OK, so this is not Wuthering Heights, all drama and stormy characters. So what? Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully. I didn't like much the main character at first, until she proved to be smarter then she had appeared first. This is a classic everyone should read. A good classic Classic novel, great price but the print is from the top to bottom of page and very unappealing to read! cheap paperback Very intriguing tale of l of love and faith in finding love. I'll admit that I was initially scared off by my preconceived notion of what the language would be, but I had no reason to worry! At times chilling, other times romantic, this visionary tale produced a strong feminist heroine who surely inspired the work of female authors since. Wonderful story, well ahead of it's time! Even I find it a little hard to believe that I only just now read this classic, and specifically because it was for book club. Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected. A Classic for a Reason It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \"Jane Eyre\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\"Jane Eyre\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \"passionate,\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \"Jane Eyre\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read. It is Jane Eyre, sir Wow! I am 34 and had never heard of this book. Midway through, I told my mother about this awesome book I was reading and she said it used to be required reading when she was a girl! I am so thankful that I stumbled upon this book, best I have ever read!!! What a treasure!!! I adore this book. I read on a whim, it was one of the books in my bookshelf that I had not yet read, so I took it down and started to read. Within a few minutes I was so wrapped up in this novel that I did not leave my bedroom for 3 hours. Jane Eyre was a terrific tale of romance and bad luck. I have read it countless of times now, and every single time I have cried. I would definately reccommend this book to anyone! Please, please, please read! You will not regret it, I swear! A MUST Read! It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills. Charlotte Bronte Unsurpassed Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius! STUNNING, MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! Its Jane Eyre, a classic. I read this when I was young and I still think its a great read now. Its Jane Eyre loves this book !!Great book and very informative.Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the many topics. always a classic Through out my many years of being a student there have been good and bad books that had to be read for class. Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end. I was surprised by how interested I became in the story of Jane Eyre. I had to read it for my college English Lit class. Looking for a classic romance novel? Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a \"plain Jane\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \"good child,\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions. Very good, until the end! Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a heroine that possesses independence, intelligence, and inner beauty. This is a fascinating novel that goes beyond the ordinary, trite, misconceptions of &quot;love.&quot; Jane Eyre's experiences prevail upon the reader so strongly, that one feels as if one has learned a great deal upon finishing this novel. It is also much better written than most modern-day novels we see today. If you enjoy other novels from Emily Bronte or Jane Austen, you will no doubt enjoy this one. Jane Eyre is a fascinating role model True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:) Intense Emotion Maybe Jane Eyre is just not ment to be a book for teens, but whatever the case... I found it the worst book I ever read. Jane Eyre, like all other books, has it's good parts.. But most of the time, it was just plain dull. Deffiantly don't read it if you are a teen simply looking for an exciting read. This book is a dull and boring young adult book... But maybe thats just my opinion. Dull And Disapointing.....",

         "ATTILA: A BARBARIAN'S LOVE STORYThe book's strongest aspect, in my opinion, was the honesty and your straight-forward approach. The reader could relate to the author's emotions and actually feel like they were beside him through his experiences. Although they have brought much debate, I felt like the flashbacks played a key role in the story. The story could not have successfully included the entire life affectively without including the flashbacks. I enjoyed how the author's thoughts progressed as he aged. The beginning of the book, childhood, contained somewhat broken thoughts and a small amount of confusion reflecting his actual thoughts at the time. Towards the end, Hargitai's thoughts became more developed as he second guessed himself and debated consequences- actions one would not take as a nine-year-old boy. At times the pace also reflected his feelings. The story was fast-paced during the exciting times and more drawn out during the less tense times. This could be a good thing, or perhaps bad. I know that this is the common in books but perhaps the more exciting things should be more drawn out because that is what is going to attract and keep the attention of the reader.If I could add one thing to the book, it would be pictures. I enjoy reading a book and being able to see the characters. I am not suggesting color animations on every page but maybe two or three pictures at different times in the author's life. More pictures of his wife would also be interesting. Especially in a true story, pictures are crucial. In addition, I would also adjust the epilogue. A half page epilogue for a 252-page true story simply does not suffice. The entire book was comprised of his life from about age nine to nineteen but a mere half of a page was allotted for everything else up to this point in his life! I realize that this time is not the focus of the book but perhaps he could have included something on how he patched things up with his family or when he saw them again after his trip to Florida. Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story I can only begin by saying, WOW! What an amazing novel! The author uses great language in this book. Any person who reads this book will instantaneously become addicted to it! Not only because the book is so interesting but because the author does a marvelous job of ending each chapter while leaving the reader intrigued. I could not put the book down at any point during my reading. Although, this is a stellar novel I do have some criticism. At the beginning of the book the author confuses the reader between what is present time and what is a flashback. In spite of this minor criticism this book deserves no less than 5 stars! Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story by Peter Hargitai I thought Attila was a great story. I loved hearing about how you and Millie met and fell in love. I also like the way you could describe how you were at a young age and as a teenager to an honest fault. You concentrated more on emotions that on the story itself but thats what makes it your own style of writing. The story in the beginning got me lost until you started talking about your move from Hungary to America. I find myself questions whats real and whats not. I like the way you used real language from today. It helps me to understand where you're coming fromThey were some odd characters like your aunt. It's interested to hear that there are people like that in Hungary. Your love story was a tale on innocence, infatuation, and love for the first woman who drove your body on its heat drive to no end. Millie sounds like an average girl with an average crazy father, a little perverted though. It's good that nothing is too out of the ordinary. Crystal Loriga's review on ATTILA The novel talked a lot about the life of the author. It talks about everything he went through as a child to all the things that happened to him as an adult. He tells us of his escape from his country and beginning a new life in America. He finds his true love here and does anything in order to be with her. The love that they had overcame any challenge that was put in front of them. If I were to rate this book from a scale of 1-5, I would have to give it a 4, it had a lot of interesting insight on what the author had to face in order to find and keep his one true love. The author did not leave out any details, he was very specific in describing certain situations that he encountered while growing up, that caught my attention and I am sure that it will catch the attention of others to. Entertaining The new and exciting, must-read novel Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story by Peter Hargitai, tells the life story of a little Hungarian boy who grows and learns through trial and tribulation how difficult life can be in America. During the Hungarian Revolution, Attila, age 9, named after the great Attila the Hun, finds out that he has more in common with this fearless leader and soon realizes that with the lost of his beloved cousin, and the escape from the clutches of Stalin, that he gradually becomes fearless himself. Soon the novel becomes a love story as it reveals its romantic side when he falls in love with an American girl named Millie. Through thick and thin, their love shines throughout their lives igniting the pathway through diversity, helping them to overcome their differences in religion, background, and heritage.With a horn shard as his talisman, Attila's emotions, sexual tendencies, and heart palpitations get the best of him, but with the love of his counterfeit newlywed he pulls through his hardship and musters up the strength to escape his all-American high school/ college problems by running away to Florida with Millie to live happily ever after.The novel, was for me a very refreshing and life-giving one that makes the child in me realize that anyone can find love in the darkest places and that we all have the power to succeed as long as we keep our wits about us. Book Review &quot;Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story&quot; is the finest example of auto-biographical story telling to emerge in a very long time. This novel is a true detailing of life's dramatic and sometimes quiet twists and turns. Often times auto-biographies are dull and can lapse into stages of self pity, but this novel attacks the reality of life head on and relentlessly drives the reader towards its' completion. This was a truly amazing novel. ...the Dogs of War... Love, mystery, death, war and sanity are all reoccurring themes throughout the engaging novel, Attila a barbarian love story, written by Peter Hargitai.

He then reaches adulthood in the much dreamed land of opportunity. Yet, due to his parent's selfish desires, Attila gets trapped in a false dream of being a renowned physician. It is only the spell of true love that is able to clear his mind of false dreams and that hands him true freedom. This love, which began as adolescent infatuation, grew into an unconditional and strong emotion which bounded them together and gave them strength to fight for their dreams. What was most captivating was how death and love were intertwined as if one was the result of another. Another theme that was important was the concept of free will. Attila had to find his true-self in a family that would blind you of your own desires. Their opposition to his love and their oppression towards him were the basis of his inner conflicts. This novel was very enjoyable to read, since every chapter will leave you wanting more. I was personally enriched by each character and how they all contributed to the excitement of the story. Not once will this novel disappoint you but it will impact and may alter your way of thinking. Attila Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story is a story about real life. It begins in the mid 1950s. Attila and his family are trying to escape Hungary. They were escaping from the Russian's which had occupied Hungary at the time. Most of Attila's family were Nazis, except for his uncle Viktor which was a communist. The escape is very dramatic. Peter Hargitai describes Attila's experience at the beginning of the story very well. Attila is a small boy during the escape. The boy is scared out of his mind and tries not to mess up during the escape because it can cost them their lives. We find out about Attila's aunt's obsession with him. The boy has feelings for his cousin with a heart condition which dies later on in the story. The beginning of the story is just to let the reader know what this boy has been through in his life and it might fit as an excuse for actions he takes later on in life.Attila and his family reach America. Attila feels out of place in America, however he gets used to it. This is when the story begins to pick up. Now we see the different struggles Attila goes through. His character is built up slowly throughout the story. Attila is a real adolescent boy with everyday problems. Peter Hargitai does not try to make his main character a perfect young man who meets the perfect girl and they have a perfect life together. Hargitai makes sure to pin point his character's flaws. When Attila meets Millie, he tries hard to be a nice guy, but after the dinner at Attila's house with his family, he sees her differently. The nice gentleman Millie met has becomes, \"The Barbarian\".Millie plays a big role in Attila's life, but problems emerge in the relationship. Attila's character has truly developed now. The scared little boy he was has transformed into a short tempered young man with nothing but uncertainty in his life. A Barbarian's Love Story is not like other novels out there. Other novels show how a couple met, how deeply they fell in love, and how perfect everything is. This novel is more life like. The main character gets out of line with his girlfriend at times. Even though his rage comes out, his sorrows do too. This book is full emotion, passion, intimacy, and it has a real life feel. The story reads at a fast pace and it gets better as you go along. Breaking down Attila I cannot begin to explain how much I enjoyed this novel! It is the kind of book that you can never put down because every chapter keeps you wanting to know what will happen next. The novel is an autobiographical fiction about the life of Peter Hargitai. It is somewhat a memoir of his life, beginning in Hungary as a child, moving on to describe his difficult move to Austria, where he waited in camps with the rest of his family for his sick father to heal, and then into the interesting love story in Cleveland, Ohio. Here is where he meets the beautiful brunette with blue eyes named Millie Becker. The love that grows to exist between the both of them is marvelously strong and unbreakable, even by their non-accepting families. In the last page of the novel, when Millie and Attila are on their way to Florida in the car he stole from his uncle, this great love is expressed through Hargitai's words as he writes, \"Looking into her blue eyes was enough. Only her eyes could take him in like that and the warmth he felt would always be more than enough.\" These emotional words made me tremble with sentimental feelings and tears. There are not enough existing adjectives to describe how magnificent this barbarian love story is! Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story I have to say that this book captured my attention. This story many people can relate to...Its about a boy who lives through many struggles, not only having to get accustomed to moving to the United States from Hungary, but trying to please his parents and their Hungarian customs and yet still live a normal american life. Its about growing up, being in love, overcoming obstacles, and making your own choices to be happy. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a touching and inspirational story. Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story Peter Hargitai's Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story is a heartfelt story of a Hungarian immigrant's personal journey to find peace within himself and to leave behind the baggage that has come from his dysfunctional family. The story, itself is gritty and unforgiving, showing what kind of problems that the main character Attila faces as a traumatized individual living in the ghetto in an understandable and thoroughly believable way. His family problems are troubling, but actually quite believable and the conversations which he has with his parents are sad yet interesting. The most unique part of the novel though lies within the unorthodox love story which is at the same time sincere, horrifying and suspenseful.Attila's love story is profound for it is not simply a love story, but a psychological story of salvation as well. The faults and problems of both Attila and his lover Millie bring a stress on the relationship in a way that is not the simple stupid movie style, but in an engrossing and occasionally disturbing way. How Millie's father turns from arrogant into a monster as the story goes on provides a unique counterpoint to Attila's family problems and the rage that he brings out on her makes one wonder if the relationship will work at all times. What also is absorbing about the romantic aspect of the novel is that it is the way through which Attila finally breaks free from the trauma of his family by choosing Millie over their twisted and manipulative sets of standards and finally find peace in a way that is moving, but believable.Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story is a sincere story of redemption through love. It's gritty realism combines with heartfelt romanticism make it and easy novel to keep on reading. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. Attila I thoroughly enjoyed reading &quot;Attila&quot; because I found it quite amazing to see the kind of life Peter Hargitai lived. While reading this novel I was then able to understandthe author's actions and thoughts. I liked how he created this story about his life experiences as a child which, to me, makes the book interesting. His style of writing was also intriguing. Not only the style of writing used but the depth he goes. I also commend Mr. Hargitai on sharing these painful andsuffering events which occurred during his life as a child. During the scenes in this novel the reader can bring realism to the setting and character. In doing so, he portrays the depth he goes throughout the book. After reading the book I became very much intrigued. Some novels seek to entertain, others to paint a place or a time, or to portray our humanity in times of crises, but in the case of Hargitai, &quot;Attila&quot; strikes me most definitely as an entertaining book but also a bit different. There are no words to explain the feeling I gt after reading this novel. A MUST READ \"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story\" is a novel based on a young boy's life who surpasses many obstacles and hardships. It deals with the courage he must have to escape from Hungary and its cruel regime to come to the land of opportunity. Hargitai also encompasses a wonderful love story, full of emotion and compassion. When Attila falls in love with a young girl, Millie, the story changes and becomes a deeply involved passion that many young readers can relate with. Though at times sad, the book tells of reality and allows the reader to feel every emotion deep within. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for an inspirational and touching piece of literature. A Must Read!

Peter Hargitai proved his excellence with &quot;Attila&quot;Review by: Andrew Edwards A fun read... This book is absolutely great because it deals with various taboos that will interest most any fan of modern writing. The book takes you on one man's journey through life. Starting out with a great escape from violent Hungary. With dark humor and brilliant metaphors a story that begins with incest and death eroticism evolves into an American love story dealing with an adolescents inner struggles with love vs. family. The in your face honesty of the author makes you connect with his younger self in the book. It is a brave tale to write and superior one to read. Attila This book is a great book featuring all the twists and heartaches of a conventional love story, in addition to presenting a new way of seeing things. Hargitai delves into the long debated role of nature vs. nurture. Is a person genetically predetermined to act out a certain way? Or can he/she change his/her own life course and forge his/her own destiny. Wonderfully Written This is a unique love story, about a boy and what he goes through while growing up. It tells you how the boy meets the love of his life. The most interesting parts of this novel is when you are being told how hard it was to have been living in Hungary at this time and all the misshifts that were occuring. This novel is very realistic and reminds us of how difficult times were before and the many struggles that people had to go through. It is a book I would recommend to anyone interested in a love story taking place during an interesting time period. A Barbarian's Love Story As a reader, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Attila.&quot; I found that not only could I connect with how Attila felt, but I also understood the author so much more as a person. I found that maybe I did not notice it at the time, but this book contains some irony in it from time to time. I honestly though, did not notice it until having read certain parts several times. I definitely though, do feel as if the book was a good reading experience for me. Love and a Barbarian Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story by Peter Hargitai, is a novel that won't let the reader close the book until it's finished. The book starts when Attila was in Hungary with his family and had to escape his homeland because of the communists that were taking over his country. It is full of action from start to end. Once little Attila escaped Hungary, which was not an easy thing to do, he and part of his family started his new life in the United States. Throughout the novel, Attila Nagy keeps growing up as a man. Soon he noticed that he was becoming something else than what his family expected, a separatist. He had to suffer because of his parents. They were always telling him to be something that he didn't want to be, simply, they were loading up Attila's anger to the point he explode and escape again, this time not from his new country, but from his own family. Attila's life changed with the appearance of Millie. She was the only person that could make Attila feel the deepest love and also the devastating sorrow. The novel's most important part was when Attila's father died. Attila realized that his old man left earth and he was not the son his father always wanted. Attila started to do things he never did when his father was alive. All of the emotional stress Attila had lived because of his family in Ohio came to an end when he decided to go to Florida with his wife Millie. He did it right after his father's burial. This was his way to escape, escape from all the sufferings and the chains that were holding him from being a free soul man. Personally, the book can touch anyone's feelings, especially if you had left your homeland to a totally different country. The book is very easy to read. I enjoyed the fact that it is written in a very colloquial way. The novel is also changeable in time frames; it goes to the past and to the future several times. This was the grabbing fact of the book; it always happened things that any reader could not ever expect to happen. I will fully rate this book because of its unpredictability and also for the way it represented what it is to start a new life from scratch in a country that you never wanted to live and see that anything wrong in life has always a good side. Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story Review Attila: A Barbarians Love Story\", is a remarkable book about a young adolescents journey through life. This book is a great read for teenagers and young adults because you find yourself relating to the main character, Attila, who is experiencing some of the hardships of growing up. While reading this book, you can almost see it as a movie being played out on the big screen. It is a fabulously written piece that touches on every subject imaginable such as sexuality, puberty, first love, a dysfunctional family, etc. Parts of this book will make you bust a gut laughing, and others will leave you in tears. This book is by far one of the best reads of my young life, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a timeless novel, as well as discover an utterly brilliant author.

         "I could not put this book down. Very well written historical fiction. I felt like I was there with Anna the main character. This book is more about life love and friendships ... endurance and much more. Well worth reading. wonderfully written one of the most devastating times in history. Never did I think I would even want to pick up a book with such subject matter.But, I picked it up and started to read and could not put it down!Why? Many, many reasons!The prose is beyond reproach, the story all-encompassing, the historical background impeccably researched, the characters compelling and it wrings every emotion possible from your being.How skillful! It is no wonder it was chosen by The New York Times and Washington Post as NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR!A young wife and mother,Anna Frith, caught up in the devasting destruction of the plague in England is the more than competent narrator. The occupants of this small town must either chose to stay and try to survive without spreading the plague, or leave and save themselves perhaps but pass on this horrible monster to other souls in other parts of their country.The Pastor asks them to make a pact that they will stay and in doing so they make the choice to imprison themselves in their town with the plague as their cellmate.You will enjoy this book in many ways, despite it's subject, and will want to tell others about it. I urge you to read it and enjoy the finesse of Geraldine Brooks, whose works I look forward to reading. The Plague! A surprise historical drama about..... It was nice to read about an event in English history that had nothing to do with Henry VIII or the Regency period. It was very interesting that the story took place in a small village where most of the inhabitants are miners: many of us today don't think of mining first when we think of England. In addition to the captivating location, I loved the main character of this novel. She was the perfect mix of dreams and wishes and practicality to be believable and realistic. This may just be a personal preference, but I was fascinated by the discussion of medicinal herbs and the different cures each one could provide, both in the context of the plague and more common illnesses. The reason I don't give this novel a 5 is the ending. Many other reviewers have mentioned the inconsistency of the ending with the rest of the novel, and I agree with them. The epilogue, especially, seemed so far off the deep end that I wonder why the author decided to use it to tie the book up. Ah, well: no one's perfect.Final Verdict: You should still read this book, ending and all. unusual book I truly appreciated the view of the plague from the people and how a community might struggle after losing so many members, but the strange way this novel ended caused me to lose all respect for the story. I normally like Brooks very much, but this isn't up to snuff. Doesn't end well I loved this book. Ms. Brooks painted a beautiful picture that I could see as if I was watching a movie.There were some words i didn't completely understand, I would have liked a small glossary. Read it, you will not be disappointed. Loved this book. First book about the Plague that I have read. Very, very informative.You really feel for the inhabitants dealing with the scourge.I would give it 4 stars. Years of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague. Way too many things were unbelievable in this novel. As an equestrian for almost two decades, I laughed aloud at one of the scenes involving the horse. Also, two people amazingly mastered herbology on their own in a matter of months. Third, if anyone was truly as selfless as the title character, sainthood is in order. Finally, the ending seemed like the author had basically just ripped the last ten pages off of some bodice ripper from the 5 and 10 and added it on. (Really.. Where did it come from???)While the time period and events were of interest to me, this book was just plain silly. Not often that I dislike historical fiction, but...... This book was amazing! I would not, however, recommend it to mothers. I am a mom of two and there was about 10 pages I had to just scan because it was waaaayyyy to sad. I still can't get some of the images of the dieing baby out of my head :(. But I did finish the book and I was amazing! Thank god for the ending. It's nice to have closure in a good story. Not for mothers!!! This is possibly one of the most beautiful books I have read in the longest time. The language and writing was exquisite. Though the story of the plague was horrific, the reader was able to endure the sadness just as the heroine of the novel was. At times, the reader certainly would like to cry out from all of the pain in the novel but there is so much hope that it keeps the story moving and surprisingly upbeat.My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit far-fetched. Still, it left me with a great feeling. Novel perfection But the pace was too slow . . . the story was filled almost entirely with unlikable characters. story that had to be told . . . I went into this read really wanting to love it since I've heard such great reviews. While there were aspects I greatly appreciated, I was sorely disappointed. The main reason lies in the plausibility of a multitude of circumstances. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of suspension of disbelief. However, for me, I tolerate it less in historical fiction than other genres.Inspired by actual events that occured when residents of Eyam Derbyshire voluntarily quarantined themselves in response to an outbreak of The Plague, Brooks allows the full range of human responses to play out. Some residents see the outbreak as a punishment from God and commit to extreme penitence such as self flagellation, others turn on their neighbors, others collapse under their own greed, and some focus on service.There are some things with which Brooks does an excellent job. Within a fairly short novel, Brooks aptly develops rich characters that truly reflects human nature. Her protagonists have flaws. That was refreshing, particularly when contrasted with their extreme heroic actions. The story itself is well developed, and she is able to portray the emotions of the characters in a vivid manner.Where she lost me was in the intuitive knowledge that with which Anna is imbued. It just really irritated me. I couldn't figure out why Anna had not discovered a cure for The Plague. Further, the historical context for some of the medical knowledge seems a bit stretched by about 100 years. I Realize I'm In The Minority On This One Brooks has done her homework in creating a meticulously detailed setting for her story. This is not just another tale of the horrors of the plague. It is a tale that instructs us, as it entertains, about what rural village life in the 1660's was like, about the potential for courage inherent in every human being, and about how to live honorably in the face of death. Brooks's main characters are full of the spirit and contradictions that draw us into a good story, yet it's her skill in creating a whole cast of wonderful supporting characters that has won my admiration.I won't argue with those who criticize the ending; while it may not measure up to the rest of the novel, I didn't find it as feeble as some other critics here. To my way of thinking, the abrupt change of locale serves as a contrast that jolts us out of our smug beliefs in the superiority of western culture. But that really isn't what this book is about and what we are really quibbling over is a 7-1/2 page epilogue. Read the novel. Fine historical novel Using this horrible era in history as the basis of the book, it takes you into the homes and into the lives of the people in the 1600's who had old myths about witchcraft, awful ways of curing illnesses, and describes their ignorance of medical procedures and cures and lack of them.The main character Anna Frith takes in a lodger, George Vicars, after her husband was killed in a mine accident. He was an itinerant tailor and had a bolt of cloth delivered from London to Anna's home. The cloth had the plague fleas and eggs inside and thus began the epidemic. The tiny, remote village had entire families wiped out from this one incident.The clergyman talked the townspeople into isolating themselves from the rest of the surrounding villages to protect others from the plague...no one was allowed in or out of the village. Anna, the clergyman, and his wife helped with all the deaths and also births that occurred during this year of death and mourning.The characters are described in detail and are quite interesting. It definitely isn't a boring historical account of this epidemic...the weaving of the lives and the history makes you aware of what it was like to live during that period of time in Europe and encourages you to continue reading.Geraldine Brooks definitely did her research.ENJOY...you will love the book. Excellent This is a work of extraordinary grace and subtlety. The reader is transported effortlessly into a world created by the writer which, for all its humanity and suffering, glides over the page like poetry, like a whisper. You share the unspeakable with her characters and yet you are uplifted by the optimism that survives the trauma.A transcendant work that is to be savored slowly. A book of Wonder I loved the history. I had not read about this plague previously and it was made so real through the protagonist.I would highly recommend it. Very compelling A poignant Decameron, more worthy of the Pulitzer than March, by a wonderful antipodean authour.Inspired by a true story, Year of Wonders tells the unforgettable tale of a small Derbyshire mining village whose inhabitants quarantined themselves for a year when infected with the Bubonic Plague by an itinerant tailor.Year of Wonders is narrated by Anna Frith, an 18-year-old widow with two young sons. Anna works as a housemaid for rector Michael Mompellion. Villagers turn from prayer to drink, witch hunts, hysteria, and superstition in their attempt to deal with despair as friends and family die. Mompellion encourages his parishoners to quarantine themselves from neighboring towns and villages, in an affort to prevent the disease from spreading beyond their village.After suffering the loss of her children, Anna nobly tends to the dying while ruminating over punishment, sin and destiny. Ultimately a year of catastrophe becomes a year of wonders. Anna is transformed and leaves behind stifiling religious and social mores to adapt her true calling. A Big Wonder I have visited the town of Eyam several times and well familiar with the \"plague village,\" so I eagerly looked forward to reading this book. The story of the villagers plight is gripping and readable, but overall, the characters are lack depth and became tiresome. They wer either near-perfect, virtuous people, stoics or downright evil, nothing in between. The last 80 or so pages are outright ridiculous, even laughable with gratuitous sex and a rather unbelievable ending. Like another reviewer said, maybe the author grew bored and just wanted to finish the story. In the end, the reader really knows little about how villagers planned to begin anew once the plague had passed. Yes, this is a good story that has \"entertainment\" value, but don't have high expectations that this is a truly great novel . Engaging, but not quite \"perfect\" read This is a fantastic novel... it is so well written. You are transported to a village during the bubonic plague.The descriptions are fantastic, the drama, the pain, the fear, tenderness, caring, worries, and above it all, the confusion of the bubonic plague in England.Some parts are a bit crude and the end is too abrupt and simplistic for the depth and richness of the novel. A 5 star rating without the last 15 pages.Great reading it along with Galileo's daughter -about the same time, but in Italy. Living the black plague I am a sucker for anything historical, so I knew Year of Wonders had at least that aspect going for it. And by novel's end, I felt very satisfied. It was everything I expected, and even a little bit more. And as depressing as this book may seem, I had a fantastic experience with Year of Wonders, and am looking forward to another book by Geraldine Brooks.Set in a small village in England in 1666, Year of Wonders tells the story of young Anna Frith, a widow with two small boys. When Anna takes in a boarder, an experienced tailor from London, he unwittingly brings with him the Plague contained in a contaminated bolt of cloth. As the infection spreads throughout the village, the rector, Michael, asks the villagers to quarantine themselves in an effort to keep the sickness from escaping into neighboring communities. And Anna soon finds herself in a position of healer, comforter and companion to the many families in which the Plague affects.This was an incredible story. And at first, one is puzzled regarding where the \"wonder\" fits in. Then by the close of the book, it all becomes clear. I was utterly fascinated by the struggle and strength of the Plague community. I will remember this novel for a long, long time. I hope there is another great story coming soon from Geraldine Brooks. &#65533;Wonders&#65533; is wonderful! The story is well told and overall, the book is hard to put down. But I had to keep reminding myself that this was, theoretically, historical fiction. Nothing about the dialogue and few elements of the description indicate this story is in the 1600s. And I was completely dissatisfied with the story's ending. I would probably try this author again, though - just in case. Well-written but not contextual In 1666, While London is under assault from the infamous Black Plague, a remote mountain village would be free from the scourge that takes the lives of rich or poor without discrimination. However, infected bolts of cloth arrive by coach, ordered by the village tailor, George Viccars, a man whose needlework is in great demand. Even when Viccars sickens and dies of a mysterious plague-like ailment, the villagers are loathe to name it Plague. They demand their new clothing, unwilling to pass up the rare opportunity for new clothing in their humble lives. They refuse to credit warnings that their clothing may contain the seeds of contamination. Later, as whole families perish, there is little doubt of the source of infection.The Puritanical church-goers band together in the beginning. The rector, Mr. Mompellion, preaches that they are, indeed, the \"chosen\". Only if these poor people bear the wrath of God's curse upon their uncleanness of spirit, via the plague, will His thirst be slaked. A poverty-riddled, God-fearing flock, the congregation agrees to voluntarily quarantine themselves from the surrounding villages. By the time that over half the villagers are dead, the congregation rebels, turning to witchcraft and superstition, anything to ward off this monstrous death.Anna Frith, a young widow, tells the story of these people she has known all her life. After she loses her own young children to the plague, she becomes a nurse/helper wherever possible, working with the minister's wife to decipher herbal remedies and curatives, soon adept at the healing arts herself. Yet the plague will have it's deadly quota. Well-researched and detailed, it is through Anna's voice that we learn of these village folk, who is merciful and kind, and who is vile and ruthless, including her own father.With such thorough research and careful accounting of facts, the novel is sadly lacking in any real passion, although Anna is swept into a misguided romance after all her trials. But the ending is purely absurd, and too quickly achieved in the final few pages. Would that Brooks had spent more energy in developing the complete course of her story, instead of relying on the momentum gathered from the devastation of the plague without thought to resolution of loose ends. (3.5)Atonement as a path to redemption Year of Wonders is a touching and sad book about a small village in England that becomes infected with the Black Plague. In the course of one year, two-thirds of the village's population was wiped out. The author, Geraldine Brooks, based this book on a true story about a village she had visited called Eyam in Derbyshire, England. Eyam had really undergone this devastation and Brooks portrays the story very well basing the characters on actual people who lived in the town.In the story, the priest in the village decides it would be best if the village quarantines themselves, not allowing anyone in or anyone out. In the village's attempt to save the outside world from being infected with the plague, they all sacrificed their own lives and few were spared after this scourge ended. Some of the book is very upsetting and down-right gross, but it's all a part of what this book is about. If you think you'll be able to get through the book, you won't regret it. The ending takes a surprising twist, which I'm not sure was the best choice, but it doesn't matter too much to me because I loved everything else. Year of Wonders truly is a wonder in itself and definately worth reading. Year of Wonders I bought this book after reading and thoroughly enjoying Ms. Brooks' \"March.\" I'm glad that I did because I couldn't put it down!The story is set in the 17th century and is about the inhabitants of a small village in Derbyshire, England facing an outbreak of the plague. The narrator, Anna Frith, is a seemingly simple young woman who has lived all of her life in the village and knows nothing of the world beyond its confines. As a young widow and mother of two small boys, Anna works as a servant for the village minister and his wife.When Anna takes in a seamstress/cloth merchant as a boarder, it soon becomes evident that \"plague seeds\" were among the bolts of cloth he brought with him from London. As he makes clothing for the villagers, the disease spreads and, before long, there is a massive outbreak among the villagers. Collectively, the villagers decide to quarantine themselves so as to contain the plague and not allow it to spread beyond the village. Anna is the reader's witness to this grave sacrifice.\"A Year of Wonders\" is an excellent novel fraught with heartbreaking detail and very fine character development. My only criticism is of the ending, as many people have previously mentioned. However, I still recommend the book without hesitation and I look forward to reading more from Ms. Brooks. Compelling characters and a very good story... I picked up \"Year of Wonders\" after reading Geraldine Brook's March 26th interview at http://www.noveljourney.blogspot.com/Maybe it's my background in medicine that makes the human body a fascination. Maybe I'm just twisted. For whatever reason, life, death, dying and the workings of the human body pull at me. Yes, I'm intrigued by the Body Farm. Never want to smell it, but the thought of it captivates my imagination.This is why I needed to read \"Year of Wonders,\" a book about the plague and how it changed one small village. If you share my interest as described above, you will find much to like.Brooks writes a beautifully tragic story. Through Anna's daily thoughts and experiences I was transported to 1666, and I grieved with her as life as she knew it crashed down around her, or ebbed away, or was stolen through horrible events beyond the disease that ravaged them.Of course, a novel detailing death and tragedy is going to contain elements of horror and gruesome scenes. Brooks provides both in abundance.\"Year of Wonders\" is a literary blend of elements as found in \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\", Patricia Cornwall's writing, \"Memoirs of a Geisha\", \"The Crucible\" and \"Peace Like a River.\" If you like any or all of the above, I think you'll find much to like in \"Wonders.\" Agonizingly Good This is fascinating subject matter-I wish the reviewer from the book's locale would have mentioned the &quot;better&quot; books..I'de love to give them a try. Where's the great book about this subject? For its historical detail and the aggregation of fear and suspense, \"Year of Wonders\" is surely a book of wonders. \"Based on a true story\" (although very loosely), the novel relates the events of 1665-1666, when the villagers of Eyam, in Derbyshire, agree to isolate themselves from the outside world after several residents come down with the plague.The tale begins at the end; the reader finds out right away that nearly two-thirds of the town will die, including all the loved ones related to parish rector Michael Mompellion and his servant Anna Frith (who serves as narrator). The book, a true page-turner, is at its best when depicting the town's claustrophobic fear and the ease with which its inhabitants become self-centered and turn on each other (including an unexpectedly gruesome end for Anna's alcoholic father and a harrowing scene in which one of the neighbors is accused of witchcraft).Brooks clearly means to offer us the town of Eyam as a microcosm of late Renaissance England, as well as \"a distant mirror\" of our own society. It's the latter aspect that can be, at times, jarring. Both Anna and Michael are 20th-century personalities trapped in 17th-century bodies. Anna, conveniently, has learned to read and write and her outlook on life is anachronistically progressive; she and the minister's wife even serve as the town's unofficial medical scientists. And, in spite of a chauvinistic about-face in the last scene, the rector preaches a very modern gospel indeed. There is very little \"fire and brimstone\" and far more along the lines of this sentiment conveyed to an adulterer: \"Who made our lusts, our low ways and our high? Did not God? Is not He the author of it all? The appetites we have all come from Him; they have been with us since Eden. If we slip and fall, He understands our weakness.\"Brooks' depiction of Eyam is of a village with a far more diverse sample of English society than any small rural town actually would have had, and the thoughts and deeds of its heroes are beyond the reach of its post-medieval pastoral setting. Instead of historical fiction, \"Year of Wonders\" is best described as a modern-day parable with historical elements: a soap-opera thriller with a message for our own times rather than a true-to-life novel in the tradition of \"The Name of the Rose.\" A modern-day parable with historical elements I bought several used audiobooks from Bookman's to help pass the time during my commute to and from work through the never-ending construction zone on the highway. Three were forgettable, but I don't think I'll ever forget Geraldine Brooks' voice narrating her amazing story \"Year of Wonders.\" Even if the story hadn't been so interesting, the author's voice was so beautiful, I was lulled into a calm state of \"zenishness\" despite the traffic woes. I even made my husband and daughter sit in my car and listen to her read a bit so they could hear what I was going on about. It was not lost on me that my petty traffic grievances were nothing compared to Anna Firth's struggles to survive her village's plague year. There were also a few incredible twists that I really did not see coming, but were an amazing conclusion to Anna's story. Didn't see that coming! This book has it all. Historical accuracy, edge-of-the seat drama, poignancy, personal alacrity, corporate xenophobia ...Set in a village in 1665-1666, this novel is narrated in the first person by Anna Frith, an 18-year old woman with a passion for life and a disdain for prejudice. She tells the story of what happened on the inside after the villagers voluntarily seal themselves off from the rest of the world. We are transported into a world where the nobles are not, the righteous are anything but selfless, and courage comes from the most unexpected places.Seek yourself in this novel. Suspend disbelief, and transport yourself back to a time when things weren't so simple as we are often wont to believe. Suspend disbelief I was completely enthralled with Year of Wonders and read it in a rainy weekend here in Southern California. The characters are very well described and true to the story line. I highly recommend this book. A great rainy weekend book Year of Wonders starts out as a well crafted book that raises interesting issues of courage in the face of death, religion, and fascinating character portraits. I really wanted to enjoy it. However, the way characters speak or act at times seems in dissonance with how the vast majority of people at the time would act, especially if you compare most actual writings of the time to this \"historical novel\". Usually this dissonance is not too pronounced until p. 252, near the end of the book. Here it begins to get truly nasty and some characters phase in and out of going from bad to good to nasty to helpful, that the novel just completely seems to lose focus. It's one thing to have a \"layered\" character, and another to give characters so many layers that they lose distinction completely. The unusual ending made it seem complete fantasy. This book may well inspire interesting discussion, and it is in many ways well written, but coming away from it feels much more like reading a volume of alternate reality than any sort of historical fiction. Well written, but what's with the ending? Someone at work recommended this book to me and I hesitated to read it. When I finally did I couldn't put it down. I finished it in 3 days and was devastated when it ended. I loved this book and I really didn't think I would. The writing was beautiful and the storyline was excellent. It is based on a true story and somehow that made it even more compelling. Everyone should read this book. It truly is one of the best I have read this year. Excellent Book! I rarely ever give a book five stars, as I feel that means it nears perfection, but this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's certainly the best book I've read in the past couple of years.Even though the protagonist is living in a completely different time and place, I felt as though I knew her. The character development is INCREDIBLE. I also am rarely ever moved to tears while reading, but this one tore me up in more than one spot. I found myself re-reading certain sections just to hear the words again, and I re-read them aloud. It's gorgeous writing. I'm glad I bought this one, instead of getting it from the library, because it's a keeper. I plan on re-reading it soon. Absolutely incredible. This was a extremely enjoyable book which might seem strange for a book that describes the horrible time of the plague. For those who enjoyed the classic Jane Eyre, this book has a similar feel. The author will transport the reader back to the 1600s and entwine the them into the everyday life of a person who is trying to live their life the best they can in a most difficult time. The book will grab your interest and emotions. This is a must read. Year of Wonders YEAR OF WONDERS held me spellbound like no other book has done in years! Like a Breughel painting come to life, the sights and sounds and smells of the little English village that quarantines itself with the plague in 1666 fly off the page and into your mind. The story is told by Anna Frith, a simple woman, servant to the rector Michael Mompillion and his delicate wife Elinor. Though Anna loses her boarder and her two young sons to the Plague she is not infected and spends the year tending to those in the village who fall victim. Elinor teachers Anna to read and together the two women experiment with herbs and potions to ease the suffering all around them. There is witchcraft and trickery and mob violence. But Anna survives the Year of Wonders, even as she learns the truth about the relationship between the rector and his wife. Anna is a remarkable character and her story will move you. Like a Breughel Painting Come to Life Although quite depressing, the reality of those years is there and written very well. I learned alot about that era. Ending was a surprise but her perserverance is not. Year of Wonders Although the premise of this story is intriguing and the story is written in an engrossing manner, I was very disappointed with it's ending and almost felt betrayed by its totally contrived and ridiculous second half. It's really a shame that the author appears to have lost her good judgement in plot development as she had me completely committed to the story and its sympathetic protagonist, Anna, after the first page until she lost me around half way through. Great Start but Disappointing Second Half Really enjoyed the book from the start. Learned alot about the time of the plague and the culture at that time. Great read all the way through! My favourite of all the author's books! One of the best novels I've read in years. It is, in a word (and I hope not an overly trite one), spellbinding. It has all of the important i's in spades: it is interesting, it is informative, it is imaginatively plotted, it is ingeniously constructed. And, as a reader particularly fond of both mysteries and historical novels, I found it immensely enjoyable. To the author: Thank you! Exceptionally Well Researched, Plotted, and Executed Year of Wonders in my view was not all that of a book. It took place in the time of the plague, which was some type of disease that was going around and hurting many people in the town. This book to me was not so interesting. I told myself that I was not going to read it, but did anyway, I think that's why I dislike the book so. I mean don't get me wrong, there were some good parts in it like love, marriage and what not, but there were some bad parts. The deaths of the people were a bit harsh, and that Mr. Mompellion man I tell you, he was something else. He looked down upon women.....very bad. On the flip side, I do not recommend this book to those who don't like to read of course, and don't like long books. If you like to read about issues in the 1860's I guess this will be a good choice, but you will be sorry. That's just me! Tiff's review This is a great historic 'novel'. Giving a storyline to a major plague in English history is a task in itself, but it's great! I am English and from around the area it all takes place and she describes the area and surroundings perfectly..centuries later, you can still see these buildings and imagine them as they were. Some of the old dialect she uses, is sometimes confusing....Me and my English friends had to discuss some of the words, but you can put them into context of the sentence and be right.great book..disappointing finish....All in all, a good read..it was passed around a lot and everyone enjoyed it.. History made real This was an interesting read. The book was selected by my book club and I enjoyed the first person narrative. Year of Wonders A great read from start to finish, I want more! Beautifully written, thought provoking tale of madness and survival. Love life, breathe deep and enjoy this book. Loved this book! This is a good read overall. Moreover, all fans of Brooks should read it. However, the subtlety and craftsmanship that is seen in March is not as evident in this novel. Some aspects of characterization are rather rough and sometimes unrealistic. Yes, humans are complex. But an abrupt revelation of one of the main characters' terrible sin is less convincing than the skill Brooks shows in developing March, who is remarkably lifelike. Some good points, some less convincing ones This is a strong, powerful novel, one which I read in one sitting.Anna Frith seems to me to be one of the most heroic characters in modern historical fiction. Living with the rector and his wife in a rural English town in the 17th-century, the entire town is hit by the plague which has travelled all the way from London. When the town is quaratined, Anna helps out by tending to the sick. It is a beautiful novel, about devotion and love in a time of sorrow, during a turbulent century in England's history. The ending is unexpected, but on second thought is an inevitable one for the family.A highly reccomended book for anyone who is interested in this time period, or for anyone who likes historical fiction in general. Everything about this novel is perfect, from the writing style to the incorporation of history within the narrative. Trust me, you won't want to put it down. Couldn't put it down This is a riveting fictional account of what could have happened in a small town during the black plague. It was incredibly well researched, and I found it to be unputdownable. Fascinating. This is what all books should be My goodness, what a long year that was! The story was excellent.Well written. Not a grabber; not engrossing. Not a \"I am dying to read this right now\" book. But all the same, its well written, seems like its well researched, well thought out. I agree with my fellow reviewers and say I didn't care for the way the book ended. I see Anna in a different place that would've been more in the context to the story. But the ending does make sense.The story is about a woman who takes care of the preacher, his family and her whole town during a year of the plague. Man, its terrible. The suffering is brought home, literally. The author doesn't skip on the vivid descriptions. But we want that. I mean, why else would we read this if we didn't want to know what the heck was it like for people during the a plague outbreak?This story is believable and based on actual events.Sometimes the character herself gets a little thin on personality, for example, I don't recall ever reading a physical description about her. But...I guess the focus was more about the social atmosphere and how people dealt with their beliefs about God at that time. I was especially impressed by how she could continue to reiterate certain points and overviews; mentioning the title in the context of the story. Not many authors have the quality to do that anymore. QUALITY. Very interesting; indeed, very well thought out book. I hope she'll write another historical novel; I look forward to reading it. A WONDER OF A YEAR The plague lives and breathes it's deadly force through the small towns, huts of straw, homes of stone and wood equally. The human subjects in years of Wonder provide the host in which the Plague is able to move from town to town. Some have an ability to live, some aren't that lucky.At the time I was reading this book it was assigned as a Semester long reading project for my Microbiology dept at a local University. The Students and Staff of the Dept of Microbiology greatly enjoyed this book and the online live discussion held at the end of the semester with Ms. Brooks. She took the time to study the life cycle of the microbe and because of that, this book is much more than just a time-period piece. It's a study of both the Plague, the way it traveled and its effects on the population during this time. Years of Wonder Brooks' Year of Wonders is almost a social commentary in the way it depicts the actions of people under the stress of a catastrophe such as the plague. Her prose is engagingg and haunting. Her detailed descriptions of daily life gave way to a beautiful line like this one: \"The sun glinted off the serried instruments and then I could see the notes of music, molten, dripping like golden rain.\" The entire novel is filled to the brim with such imagery, that one can practically taste the scent the apples bring in the vividly described orchards. Everything about this book is so well-imagined. But it falters. There is a chapter-long detour about mining that seemed misplaced, and the bizarre Epilogue is sudden and grossly unbelievable. That shift in tone was uncalled for, and makes one think that it is from another book entirely. Luckily, it is short, and one can forget about it when confronted with the previous narrative. Because until that point, the characters had roundness and well-developed backstories that explained present motivations. Brooks tells of a time that, though seemingly past us, yields emotions and actions that could mirror any disaster in the modern age. Wondrous and rich, Year of Wonders is a treasure that, like a living person, stumbles, yet delivers. A- THe book was eloquently written. Brooks is masterful at weaving historical fact into a captivating story. Keeps your attention It took me a while to read this little book. It was depressing and dark. A year filled with many, many losses and hardships. Knowing that a village really did quaranteen themselves to help their fellow man helped me enjoy much of this novel. However, the &quot;tie it all together happy ending&quot; didn't do the rest of the story justice. Interesting, until the end. This author really researches well; you can almost put yourself in that time frame of the 1666 plague. The characters are well developed, and the ending for this book's heroine was well worth the read. Year of Wonders I thought this book was wonderfully done. Geraldine Brooks was meticulous in her presentation of the village. Her character development was tight and artistic. I felt immersed in this insular world and both attracted and repulsed by the people in it. I recommend this book highly! Amazing literature",

By the end of the story, you are sure to appreciate the simple goodness of both the characters and the writing.The book is told from the perspective many different characters -Ike and Bobby, two young boys in Holt; Victoria Robideaux, a pregnant teenager, and the McPheron brothers, who take her in. Most central, however, is Maggie Jones, a teacher at the local high school. Through her words and deeds, she links together the various characters, and helps to make their county into a true community.The stories is perhaps well-known: a town, a child in trouble, a marriage failing. The writing is what makes this book worth reading, and makes these often-told tales come alive again. Beautifully Written The book tells a patch of lifetime of very different people. It turns out that their stories are connected to each other and the picture created is really a masterwork. The story is really plain and minimally told. This book teaches you about storytelling and about avoiding useless words. As it happens, the book does not have what I like most about books. It does not tell you about the characters. It only documents what they are doing. The author says nothing about their hopes, their dreams, not even their past. We do not learn a single thing about the people that fill this book, why they are what they are and what makes them decide what they decide. I would say it is a good book, as I would say Van Gogh did good paintig. But I wouldnt put a Van Gogh in my apartment because I simply dont LIKE them. So, before you decide to read this book find out, what you like about books. If it is the plot, you might like it. If it is the people, you might not like it. As I dont like it. a very good book which I did not like I took a writing class over the summer and one of the novels we had to read was Kent Haruf's Plainsong. This novel was well written and made me feel like I can become a better person because of it. It makes the reader emotional as you get angry, sad, laugh and cry throughout the novel. I'm really grateful to my Professor that made us read Haruf's novel as I'm definitely keeping it! Kent Haruf's Plainsong novel will make you cry! Haruf does a masterful job of storytelling with a prose which reminds me of Cormac MacCarthy. The dialogue amongst the characters is as powerful as you will find in any novel written in the last decade. This guy is a great writer and has found a way to weave a magical story for readers of all backgrounds and experiences. This is a great book! A great read! &quot;Plainsong&quot; lived up to its reputation and more. It was with real reluctance that I came to the end of this novel. Every word of praise that I have read about it was certainly earned. Above all else, I cared about each and every one of the characters in this book. Maybe it was because I grew up in a town like Holt, albeit in Massachusetts and in the l950's. But I knew every person in this book. But what is more important I came to care about them intensely. There is a scene of an outrageous attack on two of the characters in the book which was so real and so frightening that even though I was in a doctor's waiting room, I wanted to scream &quot;NO! &quot; as loud as I could. Rarely have I had that experience with what passes for contemporary fiction Maybe this is an &quot; old-fashioned&quot; novel where nothing much seems to happen. But if you have ever lived in a small American town, much of what goes on there seems to be &quot; nothing&quot; until one looks back at it over time. I can't thank Mr. Haruf enough for this experience and I look forward to reading his earlier works. This is grand stuff! &quot;Plainsong&quot; lived up to its reputation and more. In Plainsong, Kent Haruf creates a convincing &quot;realistic&quot; novel as he plainly (both straightforwardly and simply) relates a story of the daily lives of characters in the isolated, small town of Holt, Colorado, through what seem to be the eyes of ten curious townsfolk. Left to discern the plot from only the characters' spare conversations and actions, the reader becomes one these inquisitive folks and is free to interpret the growing pains of individuals forced to find &quot;family&quot; in the surrounding community in less-than-conventional ways. Diguised by undemanding prose, Plainsong's intricacy appears when the reader dares to take up Haruf's challenge to read between the lines and evaluate each character's motives according to the readers's own individual experience. In this way, Plainsong resonates with a different melody for every reader, every audience. After all is said and done, the reader may well feel as though he or she has a new lick of gossip to contribute to the banter of the folks at the local diner. Plainsong: A Down-to-Earth Experience What I appreciated about this novel is its quiet, graceful movement, its development of various story lines that piece together in the end. Haruf is a skilled narrator, and I kept turning page after page, wanting to know what would happen next.Unfortunately, many of the stories felt incomplete. I certainly appreciate an author who doesn't spoon-feed information; the trick is to show not tell. But this novel did neither.I didn't understand the character's motivations; many questions remained unanswered: Why, exactly, did Victoria want to keep the baby? She insists that she does, but why? Why does she go with Dwayne, when he left her so suddenly? Why does she not call the McPheron brothers to tell them where she is? I understand that she's only 17, but she always seemed relatively responsible before. And what about Bobby and Ike? They were such mature kids, improbably for boys who are 10 and 9. Why was their mother so depressed? I could go on.The point is the book didn't delve into these characters. Haruf doesn't use quotation marks, which made the dialogue feel a bit surreal. Sometimes I wasn't sure if I was reading what the characters were speaking or thinking. I felt like I was wading through mud, waiting for something, anything, that never came. Graceful but Incomplete I found travel through this book to be difficult without the familiar sign posts of quotation marks! I'm not at all sure what this new &quot;format&quot; is supposed to accomplish, but this is the second book I've read that did not use quotation marks and I find it disconcerting. It was as if I kept passing beautiful landscapes or scenic rest areas and had to stop and go back to really enjoy the views. It seemed to me to be a waste of energy and a source of frustration just like driving in an unfamiliar town where the street signs are obliterated or missing. Still, once used to the terrain, I was able to appreciate the marvelous scenes unfolding in Holt. The people became real and their stories were that of middle American life. Their problems, concerns, and interactions were familiar, not fake or contrived. Heroes lost fights, good people made mistakes and normally thoughtful, caring people did thoughtless, careless things. The values of individuals and the community can be discerned as we watch Ike and Bobby grow up. We see the work ethic as they deliver papers before school and their father takes over for them when they are out of town. We learn of human values of compassion as the McPheron brothers take in Victoria Roubideaux and give her a safe environment in which to live. We are witness to living, loving, and dying and the manner in which these rites of passage are received by the new friends in Holt. Plainsong is the song of middle America. It is told in engaging detail, helping us feel at home in Holt. The characters are revealed to us over time, and eventually, we know just about the whole community. No wonder this was a New Yorker Book Award finalist. Well worth the read. Plainsong - the song of middle America There are so many novels out there that seem to shock the reader by the way they describe events that shape the characters lives. In this book I found the cirsumstances real, but not hard to read and not totally depressing. The writing style is plain and very easy to read. A good read on a long plane ride or a de-stress weekend away. cozy read Reading your book &quot;Plainsong&quot; has given me many emotions, your writing has taken me on a wonderful journey of true feelings, some overwhelming. Thank you for the wonderful trip. Jean Thank you Mr. Haruf I have had this book sitting on my bookshelf for over 2 years. After just reading it, I'm kicking myself for not reading it earlier. I'm not usually a fan of male authors but Kent Haruf has *made me a believer*.From beginning to end, this book just oozed a wonderful comfy and cozy feel! I could almost feel the warmth in each and every word. The characters were all far from perfect but they were people that were easy to enjoy sitting down with everyday. They didn't live the perfect lives ~ none of them. But, they were strong enough charachters to make the most of what they had. To me, those are the characters that jump right out of a book.Thank you, Kent Haruf, for writing such a touching novel that will remain in my mind for years to come! Such a Heartwarming Tale Haruf's novel which starts out so well splutters and dies less than midway through and glib violence doesn't rescue it. Stock characters drift through pointless scenes like sleepwalkers, and I wondered if Haruf gave a damn.The five-star reviews astonish: to earn fewer stars from his fans Haruf would (apparently) have had to leave the book's latter 200 pages blank, or moon them directly. Either performance would have improved over the cliched yawnfest we're treated to instead.If this review seems resentful, it is. The novel's first chapters are good, the writing fine, the characters real and moving (the cattle auction scene is exemplary). Then to see it all turn to cowplop.Haruf, editor, agent: feel shame for letting such shoddiness reach readers. Prairie Snooze I cared about the characters and enjoyed the way their lives were woven together. I think people who enjoy this book will enjoy Reason For Leaving by John Manderino. Well drawn characters I can't imagine why this book would have been nominated for any award. I didn't feel it was well written or worth my time. As an example: what was the intent of the chapter on the pet horse? It just didn't seem to fit with his story. It had no purpose other than to take up page space. I would suggest you pass on this book. Not worth your time I found this book at a booksale and picked it up for a dollar. What a treasure!! This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. There is something in the writing style that reminds me of A Land Remembered, Gilead, and The Optimist's Daughter: if this makes any sense. Perhaps it is the straightforward descriptive style of writing that works in harmony with the characters. Whatever the secret, this book went far beyond my wildest expectations. What a great discovery: this book!! This is a typical &quot;best seller&quot; that I fell into where the characters are simple, predictable in their illogical behaviors, sappy, and boring. The plot is of little relevence to any real life situation and the book was neither educative nor entertaining. I have a hard time knowing why there has been such a favorable response to this work other than it doesn't tax one's thoughts too much. It isn't even on a par with Oprah's books. The cover is well-designed and promising, which goes to confirm that you can't judge a book on its cover. Plaindisappointing Plainsong, was truly one of the better books I have read.When I first bought the book I tried to read it but found the start long and drawn out. Later, when I started reading Plainsong again, I found the book to be very good, I couldn't put it down. It is a very slow starting book, but if you give it time, its excellent. Mr. Haruf is amazing! Plainsong has so much emotion and feeling it actually made me cry. The way that everything is described in this book is unsurpassed by most authors. I think most people are able to identify with at least one of the characters.If you are looking for a good book to read on those cold winter days curled up in a blanket, or in bed, then this book is for you, but if you're looking for a book to read on the train, subway or bus, you will probably have some trouble focusing your attention on this book.~Happy reading!~ A good read, with a slow start This book was one of the finalist in the National Books Award and well deserved. It takes place in Colorado's High Plains Country, east of Denver. Mr. Haruf does an excellent job describing day to day life in a small high plains town. This is a rough edged little town. Holt, Colorado is a small country town surrounded by ranches.This is a story partly of family alienations. There are seven main characters.Young brothers, Ike,ten, and Bobby, nine, are two young brothers. Their mother is suffering from depression, stays in bed all day, has no interest in life. She moves to Denver to stay with her sister to get away from her family. The boys take a trip to Denver to visit their mother. The visit does not go well and is cut short. They return home earlier than planned. Then an elderly lady who is a customer on their newspaper route and who Ike and Bobby consider a friend is found dead in her apartment.Tom Guthrie is a high school American History teacher, a good man who is having too many problems. He must be mother and father to his two young sons plus care for his sick wife. He also has to deal with high school students with their arrogance, bad attitudes, aggressive behavior, raging hormones plus these kids irate parents who feel this man is mistreating their babies. These young people are threating to harm Tom's boys.Victoria Roubideaux is part white, part Indian. Her father has deserted, her mother constantly berates her, comments on her Indian father. Then Victoria becomes pregnant, goes home one day and finds herself locked out. Her mother doesn't want her home ever again. She is just a trashy Indian just like her father. She has to put up with her classmates taunting her about her pregnancy.Maggie Jones is another Holt High School teacher who admires Tom Guthrie for the good man he is. Victoria runs to her house. Maggie takes her in but she can't stay because the teacher is caring for her elderly father who has Alzheimers. The old man becomes frightened by a stranger so Victoria must go.So Maggie takes her to stay with the two elderly McPheronbrothers, Raymond and Harold. These two own a ranch out in the country, work very hard and go into town rarely. Both are good hearted and take the young girl into her home and come to consider the young girl as a grandaughter and look forward to the coming baby. The Guthrie boys and their father go to the ranch to help. The McPheron brothers pay Ike and Bobby. Their father thinks they have been overpaid. This is between us and the boys the McPherons tell the father.The book ends with these people coming together for a Memorial Day Picnic. Plus these seven there are two more, Maggie Jones elderly father plus Victoria's babygirl. This is a bunch of people who care for each other. Lovely ending Life in High Plains country After 100 pages I'd no intent on continuing. I've grown tired of the \"poor rural barbarism\" that permeates many novels recently.Yet wait. This review is a rave.I came back to the novel with a little hope and was rewarded. Where the first half focuses on people's cruelty, the second half rebounds with simple humanity and a true insight to how people can better the world ... not on a grand scale but for a few neighboring souls.This almost non-read becomes a great novel. It's a testament to Haruf's skill and trust in us to keep the faith. 100 Words or Less The characters in &quot;Plainsong&quot; are all very believable and real. Kent Haruf does an exceptional job telling us a story through vignettes of small town life. I listened to the book on CD in my car, and I have done what I never had done before; I brought the book inside so I could listen to it more in my home. The only downside about it is that it ended too soon. This is a wonderful, warm, satisfying book. In a quiet, unassuming Colorado town, life involves the connections that human beings make with others. The writing is plain, like the title, and honest, like the McPheron brothers - older bachelor farmers in Holt, Colorado. The school teacher, Maggie sort of makes the links in town to better the lives of a young girl who has been kicked out of her house for getting pregnant and abused by her ignorant boyfriend, of another school teacher whose two sons are trying to understand why their parents' marriage has failed and their mother is handling depression (and some of the hard knocks that come from being the teacher's kids), and of the bachelor farmers who take in the pregnant girl against their better judgment and are changed in a powerful and lovely way by the experience. These people all interact with and have a positive impact on the others' lives - in a place and a community that are not happy, simple, or kind. A very well written novel and a reinforcement to the reader that kindness and support are still found in a world where one does not expect to find them. Real voices, real wisdom, real life... I had been meaning to read Kent Haruf's \"Plainsong\" for some time. So when this National Book Award finalist was chosen as the One Book AZ selection of the year, I thought there was no better time to finally get around to it. But as often seems the case, the anticipation of reading a \"chosen\" book only seems to lead to disappointment. While this is certainly nothing terribly wrong with this \"slice of life\" tale of life in a fictional small town in Colorado, Haruf's work just did not do much for me. Normally I am eager to finish a book &#65533; but with just one more sitting left -- it took me nearly a week to find the time to come back and read the closing chapters. As with most of the book, the \"plain\" ending was a bit underwhelming. While I do not feel novels need to be wrapped up in a nice tidy package, \"Plainsong\" provides minimal closure. With the exception of the old rancher brothers, I did not see a whole lot of growth in the characters over the course of the novel. In the end, they still strike me as a bunch of losers who could stand a good talking to from Dr. Phil. But maybe that is the point.That said, the book is a pretty quick read and well-written. The only technical quibble I have, as other reviewers have noted, is Haruf's abandonment of quotation marks for dialogue. Although this did not personally pose a huge reading hurdle, I still found myself constantly distracted by their absence. Haruf is adept at creating a small-town feel, but overall I just did not feel a whole lot of satisfaction after finishing \"Plainsong.\" Not awful, not awesome &#65533; just okay. Plain Old Song After reading Plainsong, I will read Kent Haruf's other books with the expectation that there is the same gentle message that is pervasive throughout this book. The kindnesses that the characters extend to each other have the greatest immediate and long-term effects on their lives. I was so touched by the brothers who received as much as they gave through sharing their lives with a virtual stranger when her own family had abandoned her. This is a book that will remain in its readers' hearts. A Memorable Book Haruf's composition is make of unadorned prose and characters whose lives reflect and move through each other and yet are each vivid and singular. Unmediated even to the absence of quotation marks, tales of family, ritual, life cycles happen on the page as shapely and exhilarating art. Simply Wonderful I listened to the audiotape version of this book. I had listened to Eventide by this same author and really liked that. He has a skillful way of letting you know people and care about what happens to them without a lot of action. The books take place in a very small town in a simpler time and the caring between various characters is touching. He seems to always weave in some unexpected interaction between two characters whose stories had been presented independently up to the point that their lives intersect. Plainsong actually comes before Eventide and I enjoyed knowing how some of the people's lives had developed before I listened to this one. Minor drawback--the taping is not done well in that you aren't told when a side ends or whether that is the end of the tape or the tape needs to be reversed. Those little touches make listening easier, particularly when one listens sporadically. Highly recommended book. Small town America Plainsong, a book by Kent Haruf, is a book that describes the lives of some of the residents in Holt, Colorado. Different plots deal with various issues of life, death, and a community that connects together. A tale of Tom Guthrie, who is a history teacher at the area high school. He is left to raise his two \"twin-like\" sons, Ike and Bobby, after his wife abandons him and their family. Victoria, a 17 year-old high school senior, is thrown out of her house by her crude and bitter mother after she had learned that her daughter is pregnant. The McPheron Brothers, lonely, sheltered, and isolated from the rest of the world, are a couple of aged bachelors, and all they know are themselves and life on their ranch. When they were fourteen years old, they were left to live on their own after their parents died. They have missed out on important and \"normal\" things in their life after choosing to stay with each other and to not get married. Ken Haruf interweaves the lives of these characters beautifully through the character of Maggie Jones. She is the most \"flawless\" character of the bunch, because she is compassionate, generous, and beautiful. Not to mention, the responsible party for helping and improving their outlook on their lives.This book started slowly at first but once it started to pick up, I couldn't put it down. I constantly found myself wondering what was going to happen next with each character. Ken Haruf also does a wonderful job making the reader feel what the characters are feeling. He also painted a vivid mental image of the setting which helped me visualize Holt, Colorado. This is a warm, heart-felt story in which Haruf reminds us that in hard times, people come together to mend each others hearts. People Come Together I listened to this book on tape. I had to go back and read the cover to see if this book was written for adolescents. The plot was so trite and the writing sophmoric. Why did the mother leave? Does anybody know....I almost cringed near the end when Victoria dropped the baby and nobody seemed concerned about that. I just dont get the positive reviews. The characters were underdeveloped and a lot was left unresolved. Trite; almost painful to get through An avid reader for nearly 60 years, I enjoy a well written book and have cut a wide swath through the works of many authors. Rather than repeat what the story is about or attempt to compete with some well written descriptions in Plainsong, all I can say is that I consider it top shelf, an absolutely wonderful book that I have recommended to quite a few people. It deserves a 5-star rating. Absolutely top shelf, difficult to put down I could have just as easily enjoyed an entire book about the McPheron brothers and Victoria Roubideaux, but all of the characters were real, likable people. Part of the book's charm is that some of the plot lines were left unresolved--it's like you're able to look in on these people's lives for just a moment, but you have to guess what happens to them after you leave. A satisfying book A very quiet book, but quite moving. It's quite short, but it creates an entire world you are sad to leave at the end. It reminded me a lot of William Maxwell's So Long, See You Tomorrow (midwestern/western small town, small boys, familial upset) but where that ends in sadness, this ends in a sort of redemption. I liked it very much and would recommend it. lovely, lovely book This is one of the strongest and most winning stories I have ever read. From its first page it takes the reader into a world that is lost but not forgotten. An elegy to how people should treat each other, a fictional self-help book for the new millenium, and an exquisite piece of literary craft, this is one of the most assured and astonishing fictions of our time. One of the most beautiful novels of our time The characters are drawn with such simplicity. What a read. It tugs at your heartstrings ... but it's never cloying. Tugs in a good way. Okay, I cried through the last third of the book. Big loud boo hoos. I was glad no one was home. Read this. Modest and lovely I was unable to finish this novel, after giving it one hundred fifty pages worth of a chance. There are too many unread books on my life's list to continue wasting my time with this one. I rarely give up on a book. Starting one is a comittment I take seriously. But there is just nothing in Haruf's &quot;Plainsong&quot; to hold onto. The spare, simple writing that is praised on the book's jacket is almost childish at times. The lack of quotation marks and long, rushed sentences are truly bothersome. But to me, a book's foundation is character. The characters here are like sketches of people, stick-figure drawings, none of which brought out any feelings whatsoever in me. I can't believe this book was a finalist for the Book Award and a bestseller. I take starting a new book very seriously, and I wanted to do my part in helping other people who might be considering this one. Buy a classic instead. Hollow Song Here is a simply brilliant book, a slice of life, deceptively simple, in Holt, Colorado, a tiny farming town in the middle of nowhere.We are introduced first to Tom Guthrie, the good and decent high school teacher whose wife lies in a deep depression in her darkened room, refusing to get up. So Tom, a good man through and through, is single-handed raising their two boys, Ike and Bobby, who are only a year apart and who cope with their mother's \"disappearance\" with a stoicism beyond their years.Then there are the two old McFaren brothers, bachelors who have farmed their cattle for some 60 years after the death of their parents. They are gruff, taciturn, set in their ways, and the adult version of Ike and Bobby.Turning their world completely upside down is the young, pregnant teenaged girl, Victoria, who winds up in their care through a series of events I won't describe here...but who opens their craggy hearts to love and longing after too many years to count.And that is the whole simple story: how human love and kindness, juxtaposed against the roughest of realities (and there are plenty of them, especially those described on the farm), can bring redemption and meaning to any life.I found this book to be completely brilliant, in a way that Richard Russo's \"Empire Falls,\" which it vaguely resembles and which won the Pulitzer Prize, never was. \"Plainsong\" is a masterpiece. As Perfect As It Gets I was so out of breath reading \"and then, and then, and then....\" I couldn't read the rest of it. I stopped after: \"He went out into the hall again past the closed door AND on into the bathroom AND shaved AND rinsed his face AND went back to the bedroom at the front of the house whose high windows overlooked Railroad Street AND brought out shirt AND pants from the closet AND laid them out on the bed AND took off his robe AND got dressed.\" (page 4, 4th paragraph) FINALLY!!! A PERIOD! WHEW! It was nothing but one continuous sentence to me! My sister enjoyed this book and wanted me to read it. I really don't think I can! I can't seem to get over the long sentences. How can you get past page 2? I read this book for my bookclub. Wonderful story, deep and moving with a real life element. I really love the characters. great book Had to read for a book discussion group. If not for the group would not finished. There are better reads ouy there not a must read This Book was a very well written and great novel in the first 100 pages. Then it was downhill from there. The settings and new characters introduced in the first couple chapters made it very interesting. When all of the characters had been introducted then that is when the book went downhill. From page 100 to the end the book was a bore. I was struggling to read it and stay awake at the same time. The only good thing that was used in this book was its wonderful use of participles and the way that they depicted the setting very well. They made a boring book somewhat interesting, but in the end the novel was a compleat waste of time to read. Good Start, Poor Ending This book was such an easy read, and such a simple story, and yet several days after finishing it I find myself still thinking about the characters. If you grew up in a small community, you'll find this book to be extraordinarily compelling. Even if you didn't, I think it would be hard not to feel compassion and endearment for the people in this little town in Colorado. Great stuff. Still thinking about this one... In the tradition of Faulkner, this book follows various characters living quiet, interwoven dramas in the small town of Holt, Colorado. While the storylines are only moderately interesting and do not reach a grand climax like in traditional storytelling, the characters themselves are compelling and feel real. A recommended read. Good read This book, although kind of slow on the uptake, was one that really makes you think. You are reading about the position of various characters in a small town in Colorado, usually the situation the are in is not a fun one. A pregnant teenager, old farming spinster brothers, a lonely school teacher who has recently split with his wife, and his two sons, throughout the book, these characters experience a number of unpleasant things, and at the conclusion of the book, you are forced to feel for them as you think, &quot;What if that happened to me?&quot; A Thinker This is a book that runs counter to our fractured hyperspeed society. It is tender. Full of sentiment without being sentimental. Plainsong is an artful piece of writing that has a pace that some can't wait for. Once it engulfed me, I was made to feel... at home. Thank you Kent Haruf. A Graceful Tale Kent Haruf's Plainsong engages the reader to learn about his smalltown cast of characters. The two confused high school teachers, the two plain-living farmers, the two brother paperboys trying to cope with growing up, and the pregnant teenager. Haruf weaves his various plotlines so expertly, the reader has no choice but to read and read.Haruf's Plainsong makes for a satisfying melody. Plainsong Sings Plainsong was a enjoyable read, but if I didn't have to read it for a class I probably wouldn't have. The book lacked depth into the characters feelings'. When I read a book I don't like having to decide what the character is feeling, I'd rather the book spell it out too me. Haruf does a good job at describing situations and conveying his thoughts in the book, but he lacked the depth required of a great book. Up and Down I gladly fell into the trance woven by Haruf in this book. He shares such a feel and empathy for each character. I want to send him a note saying thanks for the experience of joy without the encumberance of deep misery that makes modern literature sometimes difficult to swallow. There could be no better title-Plainsong. Thanks for not ending in a death swamp of surprise, gore, or cliffhangers. Thanks for not overdoing it. It's not a perfect book, but neither am I and neither are his characters and neither are the places he writes about. The world from which he writes is simply imperfect as well, giving Kent the artistic freedom and Freudian allowance to share that with us. Thank you again for the experience and without shock. Just like the title says, and then some, and less some. How often can one judge a book by it's title alone? Nothing but good and a whole lot of nothing else What a great read. Just what i was looking for. the characters are deep, well thought out and really capture your attention. I highly recommend this book. Fantastic characters This book is immediately gripping and has a lovely, spare narrative voice, enough that I didn't care that the plot had few surprises. The direction of pregnant teenager's subplot is too good to spoil here, but safe to say that some of her scenes with other characters are among the sweetest I've read in a novel in some time, while Haruf's tight prose keeps the novel from verging into the over-sentimental. A good, swift read that I'd recommend to any lover of contemporary fiction, particularly anyone from the American Midwest or West. Strong characters, lovely prose, so-so plot Kent Haruf's third book is disappointing in its lack of characterization and distracting episodic presentation. It suggests at best lazy authorship and at worst a writer whose primary motive is profit driven.Neil Simon, the New York playwright, tells the story on himself that Walter Kerr in a New York Times review in December 1966 wrote of Simon's play &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot;, &quot;Neil Simon didn't have an idea for a play this year, but he wrote it anyway.&quot; This assessment wouldn't be far from the mark with regard to Haruf's &quot;Plainsong&quot;.The characterizations of all the individuals, major as well as minor are remarkably shallow. Haruf seems to have little interest or ability in describing the forces motivating the people occupying his pages. Tom Guthrie a school master who is the father of two small boys whose mother seems unable to cope with the marriage - the interplay of husband and wife which leads to the domestic breakdown isn't dealt with. Similarly the motivations and preoccupations of the 17 year old pregnant Victoria or the two elderly brothers prevailed upon to take her in don't seem to occupy Haruf's interest. It's as though you are watching inanimate puppets being manipulated by a somewhat disinterested puppet master. It is no different for every other character in the book.So for example compare Kazuo Ishiguro's housekeeper Miss Kenton and the butler Stevens in the &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; and the fullness of their portrayals, their motivations and their fears with Haruf's Guthrie, Maggie Jones or Victoria Roubideaux. Why choose Ishiguro's people for illustration, because they are an exquisite example of the portrayal of &quot;ordinary people&quot; with remarkable appeal that demands the readers attention and involvement.Where Haruf transcends mediocrity is in his description of the farm scenes, handling the cattle when they require inoculation, or coming to grips with an ailing horse.Some novels are clearly written with the view of a screenplay in mind, this one seems to have a television soap opera in its sights. An unsatisfatory account of ordinary people This is a terrific little novel, one of those books that you hate to come to the end of. Set in eastern Colorado, as usual with Haruf, it's about a pregnant teenager abandoned by her family and two bachellor farmers (brothers) who take her in. Everyone should get a real kick out of those two farmers: Haruf portrays them poignantly and with a tremendous amount of humor. One of my favorite novels of the last 10 years. Haruf's best I had read more than a few glowing reviews of this book and was hoping that it would live up to its reputation. Thank goodness I wasn't disappointed. I had a difficult time trying to explain to other people exactly what made me put this book in my &quot;top 10&quot; favorites, but I believe that it was the fundamental &quot;true-ness&quot; of it. Several unpleasant things happen during the course of the story -- you will see just what people are capable of doing -- and yet Haruf shows us the inherent goodness that (many) ordinary, everyday people have and share with others. I laughed out loud at some of the dialog but my husband was perplexed to find me weeping towards the end of the novel. He said, &quot;I thought this was a laughing book.&quot; It is both things. (And in case you were wondering, the crying was the sort that you do when you see something beautiful and not the sort from an unhappy ending.) I loved this touching, tender book",

I can't wait to see what else the author has in store for her readers! There are other authors that have tried writing Austen-eque novels, but I find them terribly lacking. I was genuinely impressed with this series. Unexpected jewel I've never actually read a Jane Austin novel but this compels me to do so as I've heard they are similar in writing. Plus, this story reopened my eyes to God's unfailing love. I'm so grateful I've read it and recommended it to you. Great story I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan, so when I heard about Linore's book, I had to read it! She really has the language of Jane down pat. She even has Jane's humor, which is tougher to do than the language. I laughed and giggled with and at her characters throughout the book. This is an inspirational Regency book, so it has a lot more God stuff than Jane did, but all in all, it was the closest thing to Jane Austen I've ever read. I give it four out of five stars! I will be sure to read all of the books that Linore writes. SUCH FUN! Closest Thing to Jane Austen Since her Writing Desk! I read a great deal of Christian fiction. This book was very, very close to wonderful, but its flaws overwhelm it.Pros:- dialogue: truly wonderful, result of a gifted author- voice: spot on, Austenian voice- setting: well doneNeutral:- the preachiness level (in terms of quantity of doctrine) was higher than most new Christian fiction coming out, more like an old Jeanette Oke.Cons:- heroine: was she really that stupid? Her \"innocence\" was sometimes just \"stupid,\" and her characterization didn't stay consistent, but not in a way that implied growth but in a way that implied flakiness- hero: there's alpha male, and then there's \"I'm a better dresser than you, I will choose the fabrics for your trousseau, remove your jewelry when you're dressed badly, and probably beat you when you get too fat to fit into the latest fashions\" (okay, maybe that last bit is just a projection in my eyes...)- conflict: um... where was it again? Oh yes, 50% of the book was angsty unequal yoke moaning- resolution: send lover boy off to Conversion Camp with Perfect Father until he Sees The Light and they can live happily ever after. HUH?!?!I am prompted to write this review because it was SO CLOSE to being amazing. The author is far more talented than most of the faith fiction authors out there. She just missed the mark here, and so I was proportionately more disappointed. I will look for other of her works, but it's a shame this one didn't live up to its promise. TSTL meets Mr. Darcy (spoilers) This was a really enjoyable read. I read it in about two days. I am already looking forward to the second book. It was so fun to go and visit this time period, as I am a Jane Austen fan. My favorite part of the book was Ariana's ball. I also loved how the author would give us the views from some of the other characters about situations that happened. I recommend this book wholeheartedly. Light, refreshing romance. I've read this book eight times and enjoyed it every time. Ariana is warned not to raise the ire of a man who has earned his reputation giving ladies, who set their cap for him, a good set down. Ariana doesn't want to be among them, but as you know, if you get too close to the fire you might get burned. She doesn't look for problems -- they find her. Saving her from disaster comes more than once from a least likely source. You'll find this book a good source for laughter while presenting undaunted faith and find that prayer will prove all things work together for good to them who are the called according to His purpose. Faith and Humor, Too. Well, I must say that this genre is not my typical style of book. I usually stick to mysteries and fantasies. But, since I love the book Pride & Prejudice, I thought I would give this book a try. I'll admit that it was better than my expectations and I can't wait to get my hands on any books to follow. Following Ariana's struggles with Mr. Mornay was an absolute delight! If you like Pride & Prejudice, you'll love this book! This is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. You really feel yourself drawn into the characters and the plot. Although it is a Christian book (which is a plus), it doesn't sound preach-y. I couldn't put it down and highly recommend it. Before the season ends review I must say that out of all the excellent Christian fiction books I've read, this one is by FAR my favorite. The detail is superb, drawing you into the story and making it impossible to put the book down! Everything about this book was excellent, from the obviously in depth research the author did to the character development. I cannot honestly say there is one thing about this book that I didn't like! (And I am rather picky about books) This book is a MUST read, especially for those who enjoy Jane Austen's works. This book reminded me of Pride & Prejudice, though there were many differences. I greatly look forward to more from this author! A delightful read, reminiscent of Jane Austen! I really enjoyed reading Before the Season Ends and I hope that there will be a sequel. It's a great \"escape book\" which brought me straight to the Regency in England. I felt as if I were with these characters and I wanted to linger with them! Ms. Burkard opens a door through her writing which allows the reader to enter a time that no longer exists. I recommend this book for people of all ages. The character of Ariana sets a wonderful example as a woman who makes wise choices. She stands firm when it comes to her faith and is not swayed or impressed by the society surrounding her. The smoothness of writing simply flowed and the story had me captivated until the very end. If you want to read a book that is beautifully written, touches your heart AND keeps you entertained - I recommend this book! Before the Seasons Ends is beautifully written & totally entertaining The only reason I read this book was because I got it for free. Even then, I felt that my time was wasted reading this book. The book started out okay at first and then half way through, the heroine got really annoying insisting that the man she loves truly turned to God before she could marry him. Don't waste your time!!! Boring and Annoying This book was a big disappointment. I purchased it for my Kindle after reading the great reviews. The main character seemed childish and I couldn't relate to her decisions, especially to her insistence upon marrying the rector who was her father's age. Philip Mornay seemed like a pathetic Mr. Darcy wannabe. He was misunderstood until he met Ariana and he tried to deny his growing attraction to her. I didn't like him and found it irritating how much emphasis he put on picking out Ariana's wardrobe. The entire book was extremely predictable and the few last-minute attempts at plot twists were over-dramatic. Very Disappointing The author, Linore Rose Burkard, wrote this book beautifully!!!! I can't hardly put it down!!! I can't wait for book two to come out!!! The book \"Before the Season Ends\" reminds me of how my relationship is with God. I'm so glad that I bought this book!!!! Thank you!!!! L. Wong-Suhu, Flushing, NY Wonderful and Beautiful Book!!!! I loved this story. I have to admit to never reading Jane Austen (that I can remember) but I love a good inspirational romance and this story captivated me. Although it was sometimes a bit predictable, I loved it none the less! When I finished this one, I immediately bought the next in the series and JUST finished that one! Loved it! My wife read this self-published book and really liked it. Here is what she had to say about it:Burkard creates a story that will have you turning pages until the end.The courtship between Ariana and Phillip made this book a page-turner.I could not put it down until I learned the final paths these two characters had chosen.Ariana is a likeable breath of fresh air among unchallenged convention.Burkard's attention to her craft is shown throughout;from her obviousresearch to in-depth character and plot development.I won't give the story away but I will say that I would recommend thisbook to anyone interested in Regency and great character developmentrich with unpredictability.I found Burkard to be a top-quality writer. I hope we can look forward to seeing more wonderfully crafted works from her. (R. Case) Very well done Before the Season Ends is a romantic tale (my favorite!) set in the early 1800's. Ariana, the heroine of this story, believes that through devine intervention she is to be wed to the towns rector, Mr. Hathaway who is nearly 60 years her senior.Her parents would have none of this! Having been offered many times before by Aunt Bentley to come to London for a Season, Ariana's parents send her away in hopes of clearing her mind of Mr. Hathaway.Arianna is a bit scared and excited to stay with her aunt. She knows in her heart that no matter who would be interested in her during her \"season\" that it must be a man of God or she will have no interest.Before the Season Ends is a historical romance that will whisk you away to London in a time in history where young ladies had \"seasons\" and things were done the proper way for those with wealth.I found this story to be a delightful read. Once I picked up the book it was hard to put it down. It was well written and gave a clear description of early London in an interesting way.And if you like a good romantic tale then you will quite enjoy this story! A Great Romantic Historical Fiction Before the Season Ends had me smiling like a cheshire cat. It is wonderfully light and witty! Yet absolutely intriguing. You will fall in love with the innocent Miss Ariana Forsythe and the fashionable Mr. Mornay. Their personalities clash and sizzle. Follow both hero and heroine as they grow in faith. You'll chuckle at their antics and hold your breath through their challenges. I promise you won't want to put the book down. It is a must read. Linore Rose Burkard has done a fabulous job. Linore Rose Burkard does her homework. Her knowledge of the time period is outstanding. I'd like to highly recommend Linore Rose Burkhard's BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS, an inspirational Regency published by Harvest House.BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS features a young, innocent heroine, Ariana Forsythe, and a moody, irascible hero, Phillip Mornay. This book will appeal to all who loved Mr. Darcy's character in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, yet it goes on beyond that classic in that the book contains a faith journey as well. There's the required ingredients that make a book a Regency--the clothing, the places--Carlton House, Vauxhall--Regency bucks and Prinny himself, but the ingredient of faith makes this book so much richer. Bravo, Linore!I am beyond ecstatic to learn that there will be a sequel--THE HOUSE IN GROSVENOR SQUARE in April of 2009!Laurie Kingerywww.lauriekingery.comHILL COUNTRY CHRISTMAS, Steeple Hill Love Inspired, Oct.'08 BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS This was a wonderful book! I have read many similar books by Lori Wick or Janette Oke but this was by for the best! I read it in 3 days....I read every chance I got. Couldn't put it down! I really appreciated the well written, well paced, well-rounded characters of this book. I enjoyed every minute of it. It's really impressive this is a debut book, and I'm very happy to recommend it. It's inspiring to see someone be able to write so well and bring in Christianity is such a wonderful way. Very impressed",

         "I greatly enjoy reading the books of history from the Bible's Old Testament. They are incredibly exciting, full of battles, politics, intrigue, assassinations, lust, greed, and everything that makes for a good thriller. And this book is a pretty good thriller while setting up some descent character development and plot threads for the upcoming books in the series. I have not read the other books in this series, but I look forward to doing so soon. If they are on the same level as this one then they would be well worth the read. And of course, you have all the time that the mercy of God and the psalms of David are mentioned. I especially appreciated how the psalms were consistently shown as being such a natural part of people's lives that they would sing them to themselves at odd times. We sometimes forget that the psalms started out as praise songs. We sing songs to ourselves all the time in modern times, so why wouldn't they do it in ancient times as well.This book does a really good job of explaining how a child born to a godless father could eventually become one of the most godly kings of Judah. Nothing in here contradicts the Biblical record and I really love how details of the way in which the ancient Jewish peoples lived and interacted with each other are included in the story. Also, the political climate of the day, both on a national and international scale, are convincingly included here and it is all very entertaining reading. As with any book series, there are a few too many minor characters introduced here who don't do much at all to advance the story but might come into play in other installments of the series. That makes the first part of the series drag just a little in some areas, but still well worth the read. Good start. I look forward to the rest of the series I was lucky to get this book as a free kindle edition. I tore through it and have ordered the second book. It is extremely well written with amazing detail. Great bridging between fact and fiction I really enjoyed this book and went on to the others in the series when I had finished it.Fast paced and a real page turner. Great book. This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of King Hezekiah and his life, you must read this book. The scriptures inspire, the story brings courage and hope of God's love, forgiveness, and restoration that He is true to his Word. Couldn't put it down I truly enjoyed this book, it gives a humanity to the people I have read of in scripture and has a wonderful flow. While no substitute for the bible, it is helpful to remind me that real people face real decisions throughout history. Captivating I was given this book to read as part of a Book Club with the ladies of my church. I let out an audible groan....historical biblical fiction. This was going to be a chore, like Shakespere in Igh School. I was wrong. I was quickly drawn into this story, and couldn't wait to read more. This story brought the Old Testament to life. It gave feeling to the stories had read multiple times. A great read!!!! A pleasant surprise This novel is fantastic. It is a fictional rendition of the story of King Ahaz and King Hezekiah from the Old Testament. I was drawn in from the first page and learned so many things about the history of that time that helps me understand the Bible a little bit more. It's not a light read, and the ending isn' tied up in a pretty pink bow, but it is a fabulous book. Very well written and researched. I highly recommend this book and am anxious to read the rest of the series. A fantastic read, riveting! A pleasant surprise. I did not expect this book to be as good as it turned out to be. Presented a refreshing look at are otherwise tough chapters to read in the Bible A surprise I really enjoyed seeing stories from the Old Testament come alive in my imagination. It made me want to go read the stories with new perspective. Wonderful read! a well written book and the author seams to have a good knowledge of this time period. would read more of her work. gods and kings Not very pleasant to read. Author's dialogue and third party passages were dull. I didn't finish it. About 1/2 way through, I deleted it. Lackluster story telling I got this e-book at a friend's recommendation, though I didn't expect it to be that good. I've read the Bible through several times, which of course includes Kings and Chronicles. But it never became as personal to me as it has since reading God and Kings.The atrocities committed in the name of worshipping the idol god Molech is unthinkable to us today. Yet it was commonplace among the people of that day. I have read other works of fiction that are based on Bible stories, and this was among the best.A great story and a great help in understanding the Bible. A page-turner and eye opener I love historical fiction and was unsure of how I'd like this book when it was recommended to me. I wasn't too familiar with the Old Testament story that this book is about, but this novel really made it come to live. I love Lynn Austin's writing style and have since read many more of her books. This book, though, is the cream of the crop. I loved the characters, the setting, and how the plots interwove together. I've read this a few times since I first read it and it's always as good as the first time. One of my favorite books The stories of the kings told with a passion that makes it nearly impossible to put down. The lessons of old need to be retold so we don't relearn them the hard way. Historical Biblically based fiction at its best I did not do well with the beginning chapters. But once I got into the 6th or 7th chapter it got better. But I still have not finished it. It lost my attention. Okay Lynn Austin combines historical accuracy with Biblical truth, in the first of five books which make up her Chronicles of the Kings series. You won't want to put this book down, and will be ready to start on book two in no time! What an incredible stories she tells! If you like the books of Isaiah, Chronicles, or Kings, you'll love this book! Blessed and happy reading! An amazing start to an amazing series! The king sacrifices his firstborn to the idol Molech in the land of Israel. God had chosen Israel as His nation, but throughout the history Israel did not always choose God. During the reign of king Ahaz, idolatry was rife in Israel.Hezekiah witnesses his brother being sacrificed to Molech. Will he survive or is his father going to sacrifice him too? How many sacrifices will there be? Will Judah repent and listen to the prophets?Are the Levites strong enough to stand for their faith in God? Do they still believe in God? When the high priest is promoted, will he be able to withstand the temptations?\"Grandpa?\" he asked at last, \"couldn't Yahweh kill all our enemies and save us? Then my father wouldn't have to spoilHis Temple. Couldn't Yahweh do that?\"\"Certainly He could! Don't you remember the story I told you about how Yahweh helped David defeat Goliath?\"Hezekiah nodded?\"And remember Joshua and the battle of Jericho? And how Yahweh caused the sun to stand still so Joshua could defeatthe five Amorite kings? Yes, of course Yahweh could defeat all of Judah's enemies.\"\"Then why didn't He, Grandpa?\"Zechariah's face looked sad as he shook his head. \"Because our nation no longer believes in Him... and so no onebothered to ask Him to.\"Lynn Austin thoroughly researched the history of Judah during the reign of king Ahaz. She turned history into a beautiful story allowing the reading to experience different emotions while tension builds with the turning of each page.The story reminds us that God is the only God to serve. When we replace Him with idols, our hearts are hardened and it becomes difficult to hear the voice of Truth.\"Belief in Yahweh doesn't come with your mind, Hezekiah. It comes with your heart. When you only believe in thingsyou can see with your eyes and touch with your hands, it is idolatry.\"What I enjoyed the most, is how the characters came alive in the pages, pulling the reader into their emotions, fears, victories and love.I highly recommend Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings. God, kings and Idols The Chronicles of the Kings series are THE BEST Biblical novels I have ever read. Lynn Austin's writing is so captivating, you won't be able to put the book down! While reading this series, I actually had to make myself not even touch the book before I went to work - because several times I did just that, lost all track of time and wound up arriving late to work!I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. It really fleshes out certain Biblical characters and events, enabling you to really feel involved with the Biblical accounts. They become more than just words on a page in a history book - they become living, breathing people that really walked this earth. I was pleased that the author stayed very true to the Bible. I have read novels in this genre before that took great liberties with the facts as presented in the Bible. I did not feel that this was one of those. In fact, the author uses direct quotes from the Bible at all times when the prophets delivered their prophecies! At the front of the book, the author lists the scriptures used to write the story and encourages you to study it more deeply.This is a well-written, page-turning, true-to-the-Word book that will keep you reading for hours and deepen your appreciation for God's love and grace. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. A Captivating Read! I have read the ebook Gods and Kings twice, and have studied the Bible since 1974, reading the entire bible once a year from 1974-2005 twice in 2006, three times 2007-9 and 2011-12 four times 2010. Except for three historical errors, I find Gods and Kings quite true to the Bible and history. The first error is when Hezekiah was taken to watch the Moloch sacrifice of his older brother. that couldn't happen. Children sacrificed to Moloch as well as Baal, Chemosh and Dagon were sacrificed when they were between three and five years old. Hezekiah would have been between two and four years old. Children were not weaned until they were three and didn't go to worship services until they were five. Hezekiah may have seen half-brothers sacrificed but not his older brother. The second error is, Hezekiah couldn;t be sacrificed to Moloch. Moloch, Baal, Chemosh, and Dagon required the first born child. The third error is children didn't wear clothes until they were five in Biblical times. A look at the kindle book Gods and Kings. Great read! Brings biblical story into new areas of consideration that may not normally enter our thoughts, especially the issue of idolatry and its consequences. Great read! Austin brings to life a part of the gospel many wish to skip over. The horror of idolatry is described in ways many refuse to visualize because of the horror that is involved. This is a wonderful portrayal of this dark time in Israel's history and the beginning of the glorious rising out of the darkness of sin. Powerful I was completely lost in this book, the storytelling was captivating! A wonderfully written book that made me want to read Chronicles in the bible! Excellent!!And so now I find I NEED to get the next in the series... I can't handle knowing there is more and not reading them! Good job on marketing - give me the first one free, sell the other four! :) But, if all four of the next as as good as the first - it'll be money well spent. Engrossing! Great book, I would recommend this book to any one who likes a good thriller, it makes you want to know what the next book says. Great Book Love the truth of God woven through the whole book. It gives light to the truth that all should know and follow by faith. Gods and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1 I really enjoyed reading this book. It helped to bring to life the characters from the Bible. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. Very enjoyable read. I began with book #1 of this series, \"Chronicles of the Kings\" and have now finished the whole series. Lynn Austin is a talented writer. She kept my interest from beginning to end and I couldn't wait to begin the next book in the series. This series brought the individuals to life, along with giving nuggets of spiritual wisdom, so much so that I opened my Bible to read the accounts of Hezekiah, Manassah, and the children of Judah first hand. I wish she would write another series of stories of OT characters. What a fantastic way to learn about the Israelites of the OT. Brings OT Characters to Life Absolutely amazing. Loved every minute of this whole series! Well worth every minute spent reading. A must read! I will be reading the whole series again soon! :) Awesome Great read - has all the elements of a compelling novel! This series would have to be one of the best Christian novels that I have read. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Great read Gods and Kings by Lynn Austin is an excellent biographical fictionized version of the Old Testamnet king, King Hezekiah. The book starts off however when his father, the idolatrous King Ahaz is still in power. Wanting to gain favor in the eyes of the idol god Molech, Ahaz calls for a human sacrifice of the eldest sons of his people. He himself sarifices his oldest son Eliab. Hezekiah, who then was still a mere child witnesses his brother being engulfed into the flames of Molech.While the country is in the brink of being attacked, King Ahaz calls forth another sacrifice to occur. This time however, Hezekiah is now the eldest since he was born second. Frightened to death b/c he know he is about to die he hears the prophet Isaiah prophesize to King Ahaz about how the country is going to be in ruins. He hears Isaiah also tell him, \"When you pass through the flames you will not be burnt.\" As Hezekiah and the other make their way up to the flaming mouth of Molech he calls out \"Yahweh!\" hoping someone will save him. When the priest of Molech asks which one is the eldest, Uriah, the palace adminstrator who happens to also be the High Priest of Yahweh places his hand on top of Amariah, Hezekiah's half-brother. It is here that Hezekiah realizes the Yahweh saved him from being sacrificed.The rest of the book describes his growth in Yahweh, and then how a major event in his life happens which then makes him ignore Yahweh for many years until he becomes king at age 25.The book is very addicting let me tell you. Lynn Austin is known quite well for writing heart-tugging novels. While this one may not be very emotional it is rich in history and you can also imagine you were right there along with the characters.I especially liked near the ending when Hezekiah claims he hated his father's idolatry but he realizes he himself is an idolator. Hezekiah was following his own wisdom and intellect instead of trusting in Yahweh's judgement. When we follow our own wisdom that too is considered idolatry.I reccommend this book to anyone who loves Lynn Austin's other books (such as me since she's my fav. author! lol) or anyone interested in biblical history. Lynn Austin did quite a vast amount of research to write this series and it is cleary shown in the words of the book. Never have I been so fascinated by a Old Testament king who brought his nation back to God. excellent biographical fiction Thought this book was great. Well written, I could not stop reading.My only issue is with a lot of the other reviews that say this is a Christian book. It is not, Google King Hezekiah and learn that he is of the House of David and Jewish. For those reading that he is of the genealogy of Jesus and assuming he is Christian is forgetting that Jesus himself was Jewish.Sorry for my little rant but please know what you are reading. This is not a Christian book, King Hezekiah is Jewish!!!!!!!!!!! I have read the old testament many times but reading this book has brought it to life for me. My sister is on book five and she says that these books have ministered to her heart in so many ways. I am heading out to the library to get the rest of them. Amazing! Loved the connection not only with history and the Bible but also with Lynn's interpretation of the characters. Made me want to seek out the Word in the Kings and Chronicles. Anything that leads us to the Lord has to be great. It send be back to the Word Ms. Austin has taken the reader on a journey back into time weaving truth with fiction in such a way that she has managed to pen a read that is not only descriptive but good as well.This is the story of Hezekiah who will eventually assume the role of king as a descendent of King David. This story opens with Hezekiah as a young boy and we grow with him as he faces many challenges to both his life, and his faith. His father is King Ahaz, and he has plotted to sacrifice Hezekiah in order to gain the favor of the gods, and win the war that has currently decimated his army and killed his own brother. Hezekiah's mother Abijah will do all that she can to spare her last son from his father's evil machinations. She has only two men that she can rely on, but can she trust them to save her beloved son?Hezekiah is destined for great things and manages to survive his childhood but he is now a man and the dangers to him have not dissipated. He is now King, and his mother and his wife, two women that love Hezekiah, must now stand back, and wait to see if his faith is strong enough to help him survive the treachery and violence that surrounds him. Will he be strong enough to stand by his beliefs and save his country?This was a very moving read as well as being very descriptive. Fans of Christian novels will find no fault with this vivid story and characters. Ms. Austin has managed to bring the Old Testament to life in a way that is not only entertaining, but educational as well.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com A Good Historical Read! I was browsing the free kindle books and came across this one and downloaded it as I did with a few other random books I came across. I have to admit I wouldn't have downloaded if if it wasn't free as I had already purchased one too many, but I am extremely glad I did! It was well worth the read and went on to purchase all the other books in the series.The only thing that I felt was undeserving was the $0.00 price tag. For all the emotions and faith it stirred in me I would have wanted to purchase this book to support the author, but if her intention was to capture new readers with a $0.00 price tag, she has certainly succeeded. I had never heard of Lynn Austin prior and have only just caught onto Christian fiction and she has already made it to my list of authors to watch out for.My mother in law has just finished reading this book and she tremendously enjoyed this book as I have and is now onto the second book.I highly recommend this book! You will not regret reading this book! So glad I found this series.. Makes the Old Testament come alive..... I'm now in book 4....looking forward to reading more of Lynn Austin Great",

A I begain to read it... At first it was intriging but the further I got into it it seemed to drag on. It is not te type of bok I normally read and I have yet to complete it. The Last book I read before this I purchased in paper back and begn to read ater Supper (7pm) I read and completed the book at 1 amCould not put it down. Pursuasion however I can Put down and unlss im bored woul not pick it up to read. not thatit was a borin book I understand the concept it is just dry. Persuasion Curiosity Chinese water torture? Sounds like a welcome diversion from this boring redundant work of &quot;art&quot; to me. I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime &quot;soap&quot;. In conclusion, not only do I NOT recommend this novel, but I pledge to do my best to begin an anti-Persuasion League, to prevent the widespread development of narcolepsy in high school students who are forced to read worthlessly painful novels. How does Chinese water torture sound? Jane Austen's last completed novel, which was published posthumously was Persuasion and the story starts with Anne Elliot, an upper-class girl at the age of 19, falling in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth. They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa`s and Henrietta`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! They were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\" A very lovely novel After reading Northanger Abbey, I decided to round out my Austen reading with Persuasion. About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that! Perhaps not Austen's best, but still very good Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it. Rich, thoughtful, and romantic Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Best If you are a Jane Austen fan, as I am, you will surely enjoy Persuasion. The basic premise is about a young woman who was persuaded to let the love of her life get away, but now he has come back and she's wondering if she still has a chance. Books from this era accurately reflect how actions of individuals were always to be moderate and proper. Nowadays there would be no reason for this book because more likely than not the individuals involved would simply confront each other with questions to find out how the other felt. But back then being so forward was unheard of. So what we have here is a book filled with sexual/romantic tensions that makes for a very exciting read. Jane Austen's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is not milking the climax of her stories for all they're worth. When you reach the scenes in her books that everything has been leading up to, they are always brushed over with scant details and little actual dialogue so that you can't really feel what took place. A bonus about the Austen novels is that they are not so long that it is intimidating just to open them. Overall I would rate this as the best Austen book. Pure Jane Austen In Mrs. Croft's statement &quot;we women don't want to be in calm waters all our lives&quot; Jane Austen and her heroine, Anne Elliott, move beyond the domestic, from the bracing sea air of Lyme, to glimpses into the seafaring adventures of the Navy brethren. This to me is the predominate appeal of Persuasion - Anne, in her approaching maturity, is reunited with her former suitor in what we may expect is a deeper, more heartfelt love, having endured separation for so many years and she has the prospect of joining him at sea. My heart leaps to see her escaping domesticity and the dull social duties as exemplified by Sir Walter and her sister Elizabeth. Of course, Austen's use of language is perfect. My favourite Austen novel. The film adaptation with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds exquisitely captures the mood and characters of this book. Austen in her maturity. As far as reading the text goes, it's easy to read. It's just like any other version of Austen that I have read.HOWEVER, I do want to make a very important point for those considering this version and others by this company. The pictures really ruin the flow of the book. You will be reading, then there is a huge blank space after the text. Click next page and you get a picture that is really hard to get a look at, then next page you see the caption and some space before the text continues. It really disrupts the reading to have this randomly throughout the chapters.Aside from that, the kindle version is decent. pictures are annoying This is my first exposure to Jane Austen. After going back to the beginning a 2nd time the story became clearer. Enjoyment Love, love, love it! Never boring, didn't want to put it down! I highly recommend everyone read this, it's a quick read. Great book! I love this era and no one can depict it better than Jane Austen. She never gets old and those who have not ventured into the Austen world should give it a try. Jane Austen is wonderful Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \"her bloom had vanish early.\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \"beautiful people\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did. Love's Barriers Delightfully Probed in Polite Conversation Jane Austin has been one of the best reads I have had the pleasure of reading, was easy to put myself into the time and place of this wonderful book Persuasion This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to \"Mansfield Park\" or \"Pride and Prejudice\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete. A good, quick book I loved reading Persuasion on my Kindle! So often when publishers print Jane Austen in book form it's on \"old-timey\" paper with tiny print, and it was really enjoyable to read her writing in clear e-ink. I read it much faster and very much enjoyed it. Austen in e-book form is great Having owned a copy ofThe Complete Novels of Jane Austenfor years, I am disappointed in myself, in that I did not get around to reading Persuasion until I downloaded the Kindle version to my phone. This is now one of my favourite novels, and I can't wait until the time comes around again for me to re-read it. Brilliant... timeless... just how do you describe this novel? Amazed at how much easier it is to read these long classics electronically (which I love!) than bulky books. Jane Austen is one of my favorite authoresses, and this book did not disappoint! I love this time in history, and this was one of her books I had not read, or seen in mini-series form. Plan to read more of her lesser-known novels...her style and characters just keep you wanting more....this novel was up to her usual excellence. Easy Read!! Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed. A pure delight To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \"nice\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it. An excellent recording from Naxos and Juliette Stevenson I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion. True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written. It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book. It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed. There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book. In Defense of Persuasion I think that it is my least favorite of the Austen I have read. The story felt unpolished, simplistic and rushed. However, since she was sick and dying when she wrote it, I will be happy that she wrote it at all and shared her wonderful prose with us one last time. Meh In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \"marry well\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \"Persuasion\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \"Persuasion\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \"persuasions.\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \"marriage\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \"persuaded.\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece. A second chance at love Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of human nature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \"Show don't tell,\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself. Fully Persuaded Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels. Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy. The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth. The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars. Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being `persuadable' per se. Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality. Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men. This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency. The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters. Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women `ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society. When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\" Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of `appearances.' In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it. It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it. Romance and Social Satire- an exciting hybrid... I know it's a classic but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It didn't seem like anything special to me. I know it's a classic This is my favorite Jane Austen's book (and Pride and Predjudice). Is so beautiful, and charming, and I love the characters,the way of writing and everything. If someone say to you that its boring, forgive him/her: it's because he/she's not a good reader. Love Jane Austen!!! I am an Austine fan, and I particularly like the audio versions of her books. The audio book is especially charming since it's read in the very witty British accent. Maybe it's just me :)I use to drive long distance alone very frequently and the various audio books of Jane Austin were something I would look forward to while driving. Great for a long drive or a quite weekend afternoon Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen. Follow your heart (while you're still pretty) \"Persuasion\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \"Persuasion\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \"up\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \"break the connection,\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen. An Austen Masterpiece - And An Extraordinary Romance! I'm thrilled that this book remains a perennial favorite, despite the theme. These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Great casting throughout. JANE AUSTEN FOR GROWN-UPS! And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end. I love Jane Austen Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels. This is the most suspenseful of her books that I have read thus far, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My favorite Jane Ausren novel so far I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel. It was written later in her life and lacks the emotion and plot that are so captivating in her earlier works. Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead. Not Austen's best Of course there are many, many editions of Jane Austen's novels. This is one of a particularly attractive set published by Worth Press, including some interesting literary criticism and Regency background articles by Austen experts. Persuasion \"The Winchester Austen\" I loved how Ms. Austen created a world about proper society and the turmoil of lost love collide into one. The book is far better than the movie. A delightful read This is probably my least favorite Jane Austen novel. It's a bit difficult to read but can still bring you into another time and place , like all her other books, if you give yourself the luxury of a few quiet moments to emerse yourself in it. Can I persuade you to read this book? As an Austen fan I was disappointed. To a non Austen fan this book is akin to watching paint dry while listening to a 4 hour lecture on the intricacies of interpretive dance, followed by a cyborg reading the phone book. Boring Many readers who start with Austen's longer, more complex works, quickly get overwhelmed and throw up their hands in frustration. Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary. where all Austen initiates should start Great escapist romance. Just could not put it down. Except when I finished it of course. Recommended for all Jane Austen fans. romance at its best I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading. It is necessary to read it at least twice, and preferably more.It's not as immediately pleasing as some of Ms. Austen's other works, Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility etc., but those who take the time to appreciate this book will find it well worth the effort. Read Twice, or Not At All. This is the closest to my heart because it was the first Jane Austen movie I ever saw and the first of her books I have read. I found Anne to be such a kindhearted soul and her transformation from the beginning of the book to the end made my heart leap with joy for her and Captain Wentworth. Closest to my heart SLIGHT SPOILERSSo, Persuasion. Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\"Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: \"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \"Sunday travelling\"--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for. \"She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\" I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again. A Lovely, Lovely Book",

         "Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst The Rwandan Holocaust",
         "I was assigned to read this book for class, and am so thankful I read it. I could not put it down. The story of Immaculee is genuine and touching, tragic and yet hopeful. The pictures provided help to put her story in to context, as you are able to look at the faces of both those who lost their lives, and those who survived. Reading her account of life before the genocide gave some background in to the how the genocide began, what life was like in Rwanda for many before the killings, and who her family was. She opens her heart up in this honest retelling of what she and others endured in order to survive the unimaginable, and discusses the faith that brought her through it in a way that is honest and inspiring. In reading her story, not only did I get a new understanding of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda that could not have received elsewhere, but I was also faced with asking questions of myself, would i have the strength to survive, and the faith to forgive? I highly recommend this book. Highly Recommend Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust was written by Immaculee Ilibagiza, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. The story stands as an amazing testimony to the power of prayer and the importance of faith in prayer, but I wonder, how does all the God talk strike a non-Christian? Does it resonate with truth, with an A-ha! that changes a life, or does it exist as a concept without relevance?The fact that the book is on the New York Times bestseller list says something, but what is it? Does the message of surrendering to Christ get glossed over by the same voyeuristic appeal that drives American culture to support Ultimate Fighting?As a Christian, the way God moved in Imaculee's life is breathtaking and clear. It's without question. It inspires a hearty \"Yes God. Bless you! You are faithful!\" It stirs the soul, paints the picture of God's purpose in this world and shows where God was during the slaughter.But despite that, the book didn't grip my soul. I enjoyed reading it, but it didn't possess me to the point of being unable to put it down. Living in a bathroom with seven other women for three months should be more than a statement of fact; I should live the emotional struggle between fear and faith, between death and life, with Immaculee. Instead, I experienced a foregone conclusion.It's easy to say forgive your neighbor, but when that neighbor murdered your mother, butchered your brother and looted your home the magnitude of the act is incomprehensible. And the telling of that tale should have stirred more in me.Left to Tell gets bogged down in details, of walking us through a holocaust timeline as lived by the author, and it's a journey without feeling. But that may just be my problem. Left to Tell Left Me Wanting This book and author are great. Immaculee's book has taught me to be a more forgiving person than I have ever been. If she can forgive the people for doing what they did to her and her family, I should be able to forgive others for what they have did to me. I have held alot of anger and hatred towards a couple of people for years, but now am able to forgive them. A must read book for everyone. Best book ever written I read many good books in my life but never felt compelled enough to review any of them. This book was an exception. I want to let others know about this book because I believe it has the power to change one's life. As a teacher, I am planning to recommend this book to all of my students. Immaculee's amazing story has renewed, deepened, and strengthened my faith in God. Her experiences remind us that God's joy, light, and presence can be experienced even--and especially--in the darkest and most horrifying moments of our lives. Her example shows us that forgiveness is the only choice we have if we want to live our lives in freedom, joy, and Truth. At the end of the book, I was in awe, inspired, and profoundly transformed. Read this book. You will be a better human being for doing so. Powerful and Inspiring This book was remarkable. I literally could not put it down, finishing it in two days. Not only will it provide details about the Rwandan Holocaust from the eyes of someone who lived through it, the book will teach you about the strength of human will and the power of love, forgiveness and faith. Wonderful! This is an unforgetable story. It is sad but filled with great faith and hope. It should be read by anyone who needs to have their faith strengthened. Faith can Move Mountains This book is an incredible book! A must read for anyone searching for a deeper relationship and faith walk with Almighty God.As a Christian, I often think about how my faith in the LORD would hold up in the most adverse circumstances. Immaculee's faith in God transcended her severe circumstances and she moved in the realm of hope and the supernatural. How many of us can come to this place in our faith? Can we let God arise in us and transcend our circumstances? How can we encourage others as Immaculee does and help them through difficult circumstances? There are many questions that come up when reading about Immaculee's plight of her family and country. I pray we all seek God for those answers.I want to thank Immaculee for persevering in writing this book which encourages and is a benefit to people of all nations. Thank you so much for the privilege of reading about your life and faith walk in God. A True Faith Walk Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan HolocaustThis is a very readable book that reveals the power of belief in God and dramatically shows the power of forgiveness and the consequences of not forgiving even when one has directly suffered from the most evil and despicable acts imaginable. Inspiring. All I have to give Immaculee tells a story with honest feelings. She helps all of us to better understand the reality of genocide. She makes us see the world a little differently and touches hearts. I went to hear her speak after reading this book, and she is truly a genuine, beautiful woman. God knew what he was doing when he &#34;left her to tell.&#34; Amazing journey This book was truly life changing for me. When I find myself sweating the little things in life (i.e bills, pregnancy woes, hot weather)I remember Immaculee holed up in this tiny bathroom just praying and pleading for her life. She painted such a horrific picture I simply cannot forget. The killers were calling her name! What a humbling and amazing story she has to tell I literally could not put this book down..at the same time I was educated about how the Rwandan Holocaust all came to be..I had no idea what these poor people went through, the Hutus and the Tutsis became real to me. Who would have thought something like this still happens but this was just the 90's. In the beginning of her book, I smiled through tears as she described the tight knit Catholic family she was reared in--how strong and wise her daddy was, how much she loved her brothers with everything in her being, and how her mother was there until the end to protect her \"babies\". I was fortunate a few weeks after reading her book to see Immaculee speak at a local venue in Dallas. She was beautiful in person and her joy could light up an entire room. She was filled with the Holy Spirit and it was obvious how humbled she has been. I just kept thinking this woman has lost her entire extended family and she even had the grace to forgive those who killed her own. Forgiveness is the message I took from the book. Life is too short to carry the burden of not forgiving others who we think have wronged us. Excellent read with a message that will keep you thinking long after you read the book!! Life Changing This is the most powerful, inspirational book I have read this decade. Her faith and love of God radiate from cover to cover. This book will make a believer out of everyone who reads it. Left to Tell This book shows the depravity of human behaviour and the power of faith and love to overcome adversity. The path is not easy - as the book shows but if we are steadfast in our faith it moves mountains.This book will leave a lasting impression ... Wonderful and Poignant Book Immaculee's story is so inspiring and incredibly humble. I am forever changed by it. It is a must read by every person, every where. Inspired There are many terms one can use to describe the content of Left to Tell. \"Well written\" is not one of them. Despite the use of a shadow writer, the standard passage in Left to Tell is absolutely uninspiring; Ilibagiza paints no beautiful pictures, writes no soul-wrenching prose, and coins no clever turns of phrase. If books were to be judged for the sake of words alone then Left to Tell would rank as a miserable failure.I thank the heavens, then, that this world is made of things with more majesty than words. Though it was hardly Ilibagiza's intent, Left to Tell is a steadfast testimony to this point. Substance is more than style; man is more than the sum of that he can articulate. The currency of Ilibagiza's tale is not words, but deeds. In the end power of her stories rests not on pretty words on a page, but in the battles of a soul.The extraordinary nature of this book is evident early in the course of Left to Tell. As the subtitle would suggest, this is a book that tells an insider, I-was-there account of the Rwandan genocide. The reader is forced to live through the genocide as Ilibagiza did: first on the run, then crowded into a 5x3 square foot bathroom for three months with seven other women. Every bloody, lustful, frenzied crowd, every moment of terrified silence, every ugly whispered rumor, and every spiteful murder seen and heard by Immaculee is seen and heard again by those who read her words.And what a world they must live through. This book forces all who turn its pages to shed the detached perspective of the newsman we all adopt when our attention must be called to tragedies in lands far away. You cannot read this book and pretend again that these people are statistics. For they are not - they were living breathing beings. With smiles. And children. And you must watch as these people are butchered - literally torn apart - by those they had called coworkers, neighbors - friends. Ilibagiza forces you to see this, to stand as a witness to the sheer barbarity of the human race. This. Did. Happen. You are not allowed around it. You are impelled to face reality - humanity - in all of its despicable wretchedness.And this takes its toll. Deeds - *real* deeds - of unspeakable inhumanity are piled one on top of the other like bodies. You become discouraged. You lose hope. You see all that your fellow man has done and wish to do nothing more than quit to the corner and weep for the sins of your kinsmen, to hate humankind for the monstrosity it has become. You are led into the dark abyss and left there in shock, grasping for anyway out.And it is a way out that Ilibagiza provides.This book is the most meaningful testament to the power of forgiveness and love that I have ever come across. Not the platitudes of love and forgiveness that deck every Easter card, but the true essence of these two things. Not forgiveness or faith or love as a word, but faith and forgiveness as the greatest and most brilliant transformations of the soul. That is to say love THE DEED, the physical act of weeping for the man who literally hacked your brother and your mother into pieces, then bending down to leave him with a gentle touch and the whispered words, \"I forgive you.\"Left to Tell was not written with pretty words. It did not need to be. It is the story of one woman's journey into the valley of death, and the story of one woman's journey out of it. It is the story of doubt, inhuman hatred, suffering - and true splendor, love, and beauty despite it. Pretty parlance holds no candle to true beauty. When you have read this book you will never again be able to mistake the two. Forgiveness - the Deed What an amazing story! This book contains an interesting, albeit horrfying, a look at the tragedy in Rwanda but also it's a story of one brilliant young woman's fight for survival. It is a true story of family, faith, hope and the incredible power of prayer. It is a must read! One of the best books I have ever read! I have always been heartbroken about the genocide in Rwanda and wondered how the survivors managed to continue on with their lives after experiencing such horror. I found my answer in this book. I am very impressed about Ms. Ilibagiza's unshakable faith in God and her ability to forgive. She has taught this Muslim woman a very valuable lesson and I hope to one day acheive such strong faith in God. This book is truly an inspiration! Wonderful book I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it! It was the first book I have ever read on the Rwanda genocide and the stories in this book will stick with me for the rest of my life. Immaculee Ilibagiza is truly an inspiration, role model, and amazing person. Her story is so sad, however, her strength and survival during this horrific tragedy is simply remarkable. Her faith and God and her ability to forgive those responsible for destroying her family left me in tears on numerous occasions throughout reading this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone going to through a challenging point in their lives. Five stars without a doubt! Story of Strength, Faith, and Survival Interesting reading. This book made you think on several levels. How fortunate we are to live in this country. How unfortunate and uncaring that we did nothing as a country to prevent this situation or at least try to help. How little I knew about the problems that exist on the continent of Africa. The spiritual level is astounding. Her faith in God is something to strive for. Rewards of Faith I was up until 2:30 in the morning because I could not put this book down...well except for the times that I was sobbing for several minutes at a time.But even though this book is an unflinching account ofthe some most heinous brutality in world history, it is amazinglyuplifting.Some one else's review discribed Immaculee as a Grace of God.And that she is. I'm not religious but I am spiritual, and eventhough Immaculee is a devout Catholic, her spiritual revelationtranscends any religion. Her message of a love and forgivenessso vast it is nearly incomprehensible, points the way to the onlyway to recover from the mass insanity of the world today.Immaculee, thank you for sharing your story, thank you forhow your book will make a difference in so many lives thatwill touch the world. I want to share this book with everyoneI know.This is one of the most important books I've ever read. In my life.God Bless you Immaculee. A Book The Entire Planet Should Read!!!! Immaculee's story is amazing and the reader is excellent. Outsanding story of faith under fire Because of the book we went to Rwanda and to Kibuye. Rwanda has made a huge impression on us. For a lot of people Rwanda is only a synonymous for the 1994 genocide and still many believe it is a country unsafe to travel due to the war. But Rwanda is so much more. I will not dwell too much into a genocide discussion, as it is something that we foreigners can not understand in all painful details, though sometimes is so easy to judge. But Immaculee is trying to explain what happened and what Rwandan people have gone through.I will definitely pass this book onto many. \"moving story\" I found this book to be tedious...Genocide is a horrific tragedy, however, Ms. Ilibagiza's awkward method of writing left me feeling empty. Perhaps she should stick to giving interviews and keep away from writing. My opinion \"Left to Tell\" is an amazing book of survival during the Rowandan genocide. Young woman is hunted down like an animal. She is given shelter in the small bathroom of a minister (who is of the tribe that is trying to kill her) along with several other women for several months. Each time when she is about to be discovered or killed she prays to God and something happens to prevent harm coming to her. She is able to escape and goes through a number of events that could only be guided by God and ends up in USA. She meets author at book signing, tells her storey, is encouraged to put it on paper and gets a book deal and top of NY Times Best Sellers list within months. Just a storey that grabs you and will not let go until the final page. Left to Tell supports belief God is still in miracle business Recived the book about three days after I ordered it. I have already read it. It is a great book everyone needs to read it. The book is a 10. I have been very happy with every thing I have ordered from Amazon and will order from Amazon again. Left To Tell (Book) Immaculee Ilibagiza's life was uneventful and full of promise. She was part of a loving Catholic family and was attending a wonderful school in another town. She was young and had the rest of her life ahead of her. All of a sudden, during a vacation back home during Easter, her entire world turns upside down. Rebels come to attack and kill all the Hutus in her village. She managed to narrowly escape the roving death squads that powered their way through her village, killing every Hutu they see -- only to find refuge in a bathroom filled with other women. Immaculee begins an emotional, spiritual and physical journey that even the strongest among us could not endure. During a harrowing 3 months, Immaculee learns lessons on forgiveness and how to be closer to God -- in spite of the death and destruction that surrounded her. For three months, she could hardly move, speak or eat. All she had was her thoughts, her emotions, and her dreams to comfort her.Some of the material in this book can be graphic and difficult to read, but it will inspire you to hope again. Immaculee is honest throughout the book, discussing her moments of darkness and despair while locked in that bathroom. She discusses the hate, the anger, the pain... and the eventual numbness that results from extended trauma. In spite of all of that has happened to her, she still has managed to believe that there is still reason to hope, to believe, and perhaps most importantly, to continue to believe in your ability to make it through anything. This will be one of the best books you've ever read -- not only because of the account of Ilibagiza's life, but because of the powerful lessons contained within. You will begin to wonder about your own life, global policy toward genocide, and what you can do to make sure this never happens again. Powerful and gripping -- An important read In Left to Tell, Imacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza tells her heart-wrenching memoir of the Rwandan Holocaust which she survived as a young woman by hiding in a nearby pastor's bathroom for 91 appalling days. This true story not only reveals the horrors of the Rwandan Holocaust and the violence and hatred that accompanied it, but it also illustrates Imacul&eacute;e's fervent faith in God and her reliance on him to carry her through this time of political and social strife. With graphic descriptions, unshakeable faith, and brutal honesty, Imacul&eacute;e tells her story of faith, forgiveness, and why a Holocaust is something history cannot afford to repeat. Healing from the Holocaust I have recommended this book to many, many folks. I have already read it twice myself. My view on the power of prayer has been deepened because of this story. Left to Tell Mercy is so so hard for humans. To the point where sometimes, when we manage to show it, we get incredulous looks and comments on our sanity. We want there to be some sort of absolute system of justice, whether it manifests as a divine being or a universal law or our own ideological imposings on a disordered cosmos. Anything else is against human nature, no matter how ethically preferable it may be.This does not sound like a book review. That's because this is not a book in the way that word will usually appear in your mind. It is a clear window into real events and Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza's life with relation to them. A clear one, not stained glass. It is a conversation--communication, not art, or at least a very different kind of art out of chaos and confusion.Writers have ways of conjuring sadness in their readers. They pick their words carefully; they include identifiable characters and emotions; they introduce backstory to underscore impact. And thankfully there are very few things that, without that treatment, can make you want to hide out from the world for days on end.The Rwandaon genocide was one of them. And the prose here does not attempt to enlarge it--that work is not necessary. The story is enough.Pick up Left To Tell. Do not pick it up lightly. Pick it up heavily. Pick it up knowing that for weeks the monsters inside some humans were winning decisively, along with the apathy inside the rest. Pick it up knowing that James Cone is right: if there is to be redemption for this, it can only lie beyond suffering.Humans are creatures of justice; the higher law of mercy is hard for us. But I think anyone who can somehow forgive the killers of family and friends and a million more might just have lived up to the name 'spotless'. Most of the humans in this book are, as it says, 'victims of their victims'. One manages to justify the stardust in us. Telling This book is unlike any book you've ever read and certainly unlike anything you've ever heard about. It focuses on Immaculee Ilibagiza during the Rwandan Genocide and how she lived to tell her tale of finding love and hope with God and learning to forgive, sometimes the hardest thing we have to do. I had never heard about the Rwandan Genocide until I watched the movie \"Hotel Rwanda\" and I was shocked. Firstly because I had never heard about it and secondly, I had never heard of such atrocities actually happening. Her story is so compelling I was enthralled when I read each page. Much of the story takes place while she spends three months hiding in the bathroom of a preacher with seven other women. The local Hutu militia checked the home very sporadically and very often so each time they came, the women did not know if it was there last time alive. Immaculee's story resounds hope like nothing I've ever read. While sitting in the bathroom for months, she finds a very special and intimate connection with God where she can find peace and ultimately find the faith to forgive the soldiers. At one point in the book she said, \"Prayer became my armor and I wrapped it tightly around me.\" Her faith became the most important thing that she hung on to and when I think about my own life and my own faith, I don't have the same powerful connection with God like I want to. How did she find the strength to not give up and just think in self pity for those long weeks she was there? She had such inspiring faith and courage that anyone can look to her and see that God is always with us. As Immaculee talks about her experience, she frequently talks about her family that she misses dearly. The first few chapters discuss the very personal relationship she had with each member of her family and the unique role they each played in her life. Knowing that most of them are dead she had only the most cherished memories to relish on and I can't imagine that happening to me. The entire country was being raped and demolished of anything she loved; her family, he friends, her school, her home, and yet she made it and wrote this exquisite book about her experience. This book can change your life. It can make you see the world as a place of beauty and a place to be our best. This book will show you things that make you cringe as you read it, keep reading and watch how Immaculee was able to know God like she did. Read the book no matter what though. Get your whole family to read and your friends and get people to know what happened. Let prayer become your armor and let her story make your sword. Prayer Became My Armor A great book !!!I have lent it out 3 times and every one has really enjoyed it.The most amazing true story I have ever read.The book gave me a feeling of humility.I am sure I would never have been able to endure what this women went thru.Once you read this book I do not think you will ever look at your daily setbacks the same way. I think this book is responsible for reducing my complainning by 50% Big Daddy I loved this book! I learned about the genocide in Rwanda, as well as, I found Immacul&eacute;e's story to be inspirational. Even though she was in a small bathroom with several women for such a long time, she rose above it by meditation and prayer. As a result of her relationship with God, she discovered her purpose in life. Immacul&eacute;e truly soared above the suffering in Rwanda in many ways. Amazing! After you read Immacullee's account of her horrific experiences in her homeland, pass this book on to someone in your life that likes to complain about their lot!If after reading about her experiences they do not stop their \"pity party\", nothing will help! \"Left to Tell\", along with Gilbert Tuhabonye's book about genocide within the neighboring country of Burundi, is as great a \"voice\" as I can think of for the advancement of the value of diversity, equality and the spiritual life. Break out the facial tissue. You'll need it. A wonderful voice What an amazing book. I read the entire book on a long plane ride (Newark - Hong Kong). It's hard to believe people can be so cruel to each other (killing the neighbors they grew up with). Immaculee shares her struggle with her understandable anger towards the people who killed her family, and how, with God's grace, she was able to forgive them. A tremendous testimony of how God can be with you in the middle of the most difficult / impossible circumstances. Amazing true story that is a quick read I was touched by the difficulties Ms. Ilibagiza overcame, and with a positive attitude towards life still in abudance. It is good for us to see the struggles other go through, so we can more appreciate what we have, and be motivated to help those less fortunate in their struggles.I am glad I purchased this book, and would like to follow her works with the orphanages. AMAZING STORY As a Franciscan Sister of Christian Charity I look to St. Francis who found the depths of hope in Jesus Christ. Immaculalee also confirms that hope ('...only when the future is certain as a positive reality does it become possible to live the present as well'-On Christian Hope Spe Salvi, Benedict XVI) can be found in God in tragic and ordinary moments of life. Her call to share this message is life changing not only for her, but possible for all those who are also called to be transformed by reading this account. Left to Hope Living in Hawaii, I am physically distant from all that is happening in the world. However, that is a poor excuse to be ignorant of the events that occur across the Pacific ocean or beyond - be it monumentally good or a travesty. After reading Left to Tell, I no longer discount the evening news as irrelevant to me because I see how wrong it is to disconnect and ignore events that affect humanity. I was among the millions of U.S. citizens who, in 1994 paid little attention to the senseless murders occurring in Rwanda between the Tutsi and Hutu.In 1994, I remember that year vividly: I was planning and busily working with different people and venues for my summer wedding. I could tell you what my favorite TV series was that I watched every Thursday and how work was coming along in Kailua. However, I would not be able to recall any facts of world events. How absolutely neglectful I was! During the weeks of final wedding gown fittings and checking on party favors, Ilibagiza was fighting for her life. Ilibagiza's Left to Tell makes the Rwandan Holocaust come to life with her personal narrative of trying to survive the slaughtering of her village and family members. Her pain goes beyond what many of us can only imagine as she hides with others literally crammed, body smashed against body, in a small bathroom of her pastor's, commenting \". . . since we hadn't showered or changed clothes since we arrived, we were plagued by a vicious infestation of body lice. Sometimes the tiny bugs grew so engorged with blood that we could see them marching across our face\" (113). I am not Catholic, yet I could spiritually connect to Immaculee in her desire to want to see the best in people despite the horrors surrounding her which includes witnessing the Hutus murdering her brother before her very eyes. Most of us would crumble and perish in such a situation. It also seems completely incomprehensible why one group would hold so much hatred for another - especially when neither look or seem very different from the other: they speak the same language and share the same religion. However, Ilibagiza shows us how suffering and sacrifice become forces that forge and strengthen her unblinding faith to forgive and her determination to move on.This is a memoir that I could not put down; it is a constant reminder of what it means to have an undying faith in God and how there is so much to learn and appreciate out there in the world, despite living on an island far away. An Island Far Away. . . I don't think there's any way I could possibly identify with what Immaculee Ilibagiza experienced in Rwanda. But her story has gone a long way towards helping me see the devastating effects of civil war in her country.I am just beginning to learn what has happened in Rwanda, and stories like Immaculee's in turns horrify me, and give me hope. If someone who has experienced what she has can find room in her heart to forgive her aggressors and move on, then I can overcome some of the petty angers and trials I experience in my own life. Powerful, gripping This is a powerful book. Not just because of the harrowing journey Ilibagiza tells, but because of her tremendous faith. She's a true prayer warrior. Wow I finished reading this book last night and I couldn't stop crying as I read each chapter, especially after I read what had happened to Immaculee's favorite brother. I'm very happy that Immaculee was able to share her story with many of us and that most of all, God was there for her and always will be there. Wishing you nothing but the very best Immaculee! Couldn't stop crying Immaculee Ilibagiza's book Left To Tell is a remarkable story of one girls struggle to find faith and forgiveness in the midst of a holocaust that has taken over the hearts, minds, and lives of the people in the country that she calls home.Left To Tell is much more than a diary of Immaculee's life during the Rwandan Massacre; it is a detailed narrative of the horrible circumstance that a whole nation found themselves part of. This informative book describes the horrible massacre in a sincere and unfeigned way that the history books cannot.Immaculee's story is something that the reader can relate to, even without ever experiencing anything like this holocaust. Through her descriptive writing style she pulls up a chair and gives her readers a front row seat to the inhumane and sadistic horrors that Rwanda suffered. She writes in a way that draws the reader in, and makes them feel as if they are actually there. My heart raced with hers, my mouth watered with hers, my mind wondered with hers.In her book, Immaculee takes her reader through Rwanda's struggle for life, and a whole nations search for God. Fighting the Devil that has consumed the hearts of Rawanda, Immaculee shows us that God is in everything, and teaches of repentance and forgiveness. This book served as a wake-up-call to me, and through her struggle to find life and forgiveness, I myself, was brought closer to God. Left To Tell- Immaculee Ilibagiza Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan HolocaustThis is an amazing book that will overwhelm you with it's message of faith, love and forgiveness. Reviewers of this book have said that reading it will change your life...........how true they are! Left To Tell The subtitle is misleading in that it says, \"Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,\" when, in fact, author Immaculee Ilibagiza never waivers in her devout Catholic beliefs. The important facts of the story are that the author, a smart, overachieving, ethnic Tutsi college student survived the approximately 100 day long 1994 massacre in Rwanda of close to a million Tutsis at the hands of the Hutus by hiding in a neighbor's small bathroom with six other females. In the case of her four family members who were killed (the surviving brother having been away from the area at the time), the murderers were their former neighbors and friends, who, because of her strong religious beliefs, she was able to forgive. The Tutsis and Hutus had a long history of distrust and discrimination before the incident that sparked the massacre. The Rwandan president, a Hutu, died when his plane was shot down on April 6, 1994, after which the Hutus decided to rid themselves of, they believed, the ethnically inferior Tutsis, which comprised 14 percent of the population to their 85 percent (the remaining one percent being of the Twas). Although the horror and injustice that she, her family and a million other Tutsis suffered is as bad as it gets, her book reads more like chronological journal entries of a college-aged Christian, than the memoir it professes to be. Although it is an easy read, those whose beliefs don't mirror her own, may wonder at times if they are reading a devotional, since about 20 percent of the book is filled with the actual prayers she employed in an attempt to ensure both her safety and survival and that of her family members.Those who enjoyed the book because of its religious overtones will probably also enjoy Dinner with a Perfect Stranger, The Red Tent and In the Presence of My Enemies. God amidst genocide An extraordinarily readable account of an incomprehensible ordeal. Compelling, riveting, horrifying, uplifting and so very inspiring. Thanks to Immaculee and Steve Erwin for sharing this story with the world - this reader is very grateful that you were Left to Tell. One of the Best Books I Have Ever Read! This book is beyond what I expected. It gave me such a different perspective on the war over there, plus this woman's story is just beyond miraculous. Extraordinary price was excellent,had it by the end of the week, great....the story incredible. A must read for anyone who wishes to become aware of the true goings on in this world that we ignore. People suffer horribly at the hands of their brothers & sisters. Immaculee Ilibagiza you are a incredible true example of what the spirit can go through. What our humaness can endure through love and trust in their devine connection. We are all one in this connection. Thank you for sharing and making me aware of what really went on in Rwanda. Also for sharing your love of your country, this makes me want to experience it myself. live to tell book & cd After reading Immaculee's story in LEFT TO TELL, \"What is left to tell?\" This is a question, I think, that needs to be asked.The real power of the book lies in living one's life differently because of her story. If all I've done is read the book, had a book discussion on it, raved about her life then I missed the essence of the story as it relates to my life.After reading her book and pondering on its message, I am called to action in my own life. Forgiveness is not just for Immaculee. Forgiveness is not a one time experience. Forgiveness involves suffering and surrendering to God. Forgiveness is the gentleness of mercy in action. Forgiveness is life giving for me and can transform another.What is left to tell is your story. What is left to tell is my story. How will you or I write it? How will you or I live it? WHAT IS LEFT TO TELL? I just hope tonight, she is in her warm home with her two children and her husband, and I pray the memories will fade day by day and that we will all have her strength in any situation of great darkness around us...Bless God... She made me feel The concept of God being present within a climate of genocide is what drew me to read this book and I am glad that I did. Unlike many who have written reviews I was forced to take this book in doses. The brutality of the genocide is shocking to me and neighbor killing neighbor seems to make the betrayal more unsettling.I thank God that Immaculee survived to share her story. The event of her brother Damascene and his handling his fate was humbling for me to read as was the prison meeting she had at the end of the book.It is a mind and psyche chilling reality but through it all hope is not lost. There are many Western & United Nations Leaders who should hang their heads with shame for their collusion with the Hutus or their inaction to the genocide. It is shocking that this happened less than 20 years ago and likely could happen again. truth is stranger than fiction This is a truly harrowing story which portrays the events which allowed a Tutsi woman living in Rwanda to survive the surrounding holocaust in 1994. Her bravery is inspiring and her willingness to forgive such actions is truly a remarkable quality. I was however disappointed with how desperate the book comes across with interjecting the idea of \"God\" into every circumstance. If anything good happened it was an act of god pulling the strings behind the scenes. Conversely the marauding murderers allowed the devil into their hearts and hence the all too easy explanation for their actions. It almost goes as far to suggest that we are mere puppets while god and the devil play tug of war over the strings that control us (in reference to a recounting of her thoughts while hiding in the priest's bathroom). By painting such a black and white picture, does one honestly come to terms with understanding the depth of such events in history? The devil made them do it is truly an archaic method for explaining the cause that proceeds the effect with respect to peoples actions. She recounts so well the hatred grown out of the development of a class system, but undermines this point by ending the book on making note of how she only wants to marry a catholic man. I can agree with her reasoning of wanting to have a spouse with common beliefs, but feel it should have been left out of the book as it highlights yet another way we segregate ourselves into opposing social groups. One need only to read about the medieval inquisitions to see yet another example of atrocities committed through negative exploitation of differences, whether they be ethnic, religious, or otherwise. Inspiring story, but Where was God for the Million that Died How one young woman along with six others survived an impossible ordeal through faith in God gives hope to everyone! Immaculee is a humble hero. Could you live in a tiny locked bathroom for months? You will never stop asking yourself this question.Love for family and ultimate trust in God made Immaculee an overcomer! Beyond Belief Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza is an awe inspiring account of her survival of the Rwandan Holocaust of 1994. She was a college girl forced to hide in a 3 by 4 foot bathroom with many other women for 3 months while Hutu terrorists hunted daily for her. During these months she lost half her body weight. Yet during this ordeal she experienced amazing spiritual insights as she greatly deepened her Christian/Catholic faith. This is a book about survival, but it is also a book about love and forgiveness. This is truly a must read. A Stunning Account I borrowed this book from the public library and loved it so much that I bought a copy for our church library. This woman's story is incredible, so inspiring. Everyone would benefit from reading this book, it really touched my heart. Inspiring Story! This is a must read. It has it all. If you happen to be A Course in Miracles student you will be reading the best forgivines lesson you have ever read in our time. I GAVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS Left to tell by Immaculee Ilibabiza Warning! Once you start this book you WILL NOT want to put it down. A remarkable true story of a Rawanda Genocide survivor. A sad story with a remarkably wonderful ending. Great for anyone who has someone they need to forgive. This book should be required reading in every high school Ilibagiza's novel makes you realize how you are blessed. The realities of the Rwandan Holocaust she brought to life on the pages were so terrifying. In several sections, I didn't have a dry eye. Overall, I was amazed by the cruelty and heartlessness of humans. I was not disappointed that I read this novel.Andreaetta J. Whaley An Exceptional Read Incredible, harrowing true story written from the heart. Immaculee's book clearly demonstrates pure evil in today's world and how she was saved through constant prayer and faith in God. Incredible, harrowing story that is written from the heart All I can say is you need to read and see the salvation of the Lord. Do you really know God's covering? Read this and then you tell me. Tear Jerker This is the first book I read that Immaculee wrote & I then purchased all her books, they moved me so much closer to GOD, my faith thanks to Immaculee has strengthened and I thank her from my whole being for what she had to endure to be the one lovely lady to bring these messages to us. GOD love US! There are very few words that I need to record to express my complete satisfaction with the book and audio book. Nothing surpasses the road you travel to it's conclusion...nothing! Could I have done it, only God knows! Read and Believe that inside of us is the BEST us that we can be. Immaculee found herself; it's unexplainable but extraordinary. Life Changing; If You Believe! This is an very interesting story. It is well written; easy to read and you don't want to put it down! Excellent I loved it...it helps you realize the absurdity of many of our worries.It helps your faith grow and be thankful. Goodalso for teenagers. Excellent book. Everybody should read it An incredible true story. Soon after reading the book this past fall, I had the wonderful experience of hearing her in person at a conference I attended in Bridgeport, CT. I was much impressed with the sincere, credible, and highly intelligent way in which she presented her story. Nothing phony or self serving about this beautiful human being. She came across as a joyful,loving, and very well balanced person. Left To Tell I highly recommend this book. Just when you thought it was over there was more. I have have bought many copies of this book and given them out as gifts and not just for Christmas. And for those who are suffering this book will help you forget yours if only for a little while. I hope they make a movie of it. Highly Recommend This is not an easy book to read. The horror that Ilibagiza lived through is just chilling. But it's absolutely a necessary book to read. The grace God gave her to forgive those ready to quite literally tear her to pieces -- it is truly amazing. And the ways God miraculously saved her are equally amazing. Highly recommend. Excellent, though heart-wrenching. Left to Tell is a book that accurately depicts the improbable story of love and hope during a time of evil and destruction. Taking place during the Rwandan genocide, a young woman named Immaculate describes the horrors and tragedies of life around her, and her journey towards receiving the grace of God. Immaculee watched as her beautiful Rwandan country got torn apart. Her neighbors and friends turned against her and all the other Tutsis, wishing death upon them. When the war was over, over 1,000,000 people had died, almost all of them being Tutsis. In the story we journey through this Armageddon with Immaculee. She describes the inner torment of trying to grow closer to God with forgiving the very men who were killing her friends and family. The story is a testament of unwavering faith of a brave woman who rose to the occasion and did not let fear or doubt debilitate her own personal growth. If you happen to not be religious, this book is a great example of hope and love in dark and evil timesI would definitely recommend this book. In a world where we take so much for granted, we need to remind ourselves to humble ourselves and be thankful for what we have. I think that everyone out there could learn a lesson from reading this book. Finding God I would recommend anyone interested in great moving stories, Memoirs, recollections of war in Africa, to read this book. Thats what I have to say about this story.Everyone says don't judge a book by its cover. I have to say that I don't know anyone who doesn't... literally speaking. As an artist it was really hard for me to want to read this book because not only is the book too large, but the design is atrocious. The paper it is printed on is ghastly white, low quality paper. The design of the text layout in within the pages is terrible and distracting. Normally I would submit this part of the review to the editor, but I haven't gotten that far yet. So excuse me for this harsh criticism of the visual aspects. I had to get it out somewhere. Story - good. book - bad. Best book I have read in years, what an amazing story. Such an inspiration and so well written could not put the book down, read it in one day! Great Book I love the first lines - I was born in paradise. So surprising given what Rwanda is known for yet, as her saga is told this woman's unbelieveable story takes one to a 'higher place'. Her spirit and beauty shine through the pages despite a horrific seemingly endless ordeal. It is so true the best stories are ones of survival and despite the topic it is not 'depressing' but pure inspiration. Be willing to stay up late A fantastic, inspirational account. Absolutely amazing courage and determination to face the odds and live! Left to Tell Great story of perserverance determination and most of all faith. Talking and praying to God was all she had. She had a solid unwavering relationship with God. This book strenghten my reliance on God even more so. Hope The conclusion of the Rwandan Holocaust in 1994 marked a critical checkpoint for a nation mercilessly ripped apart by evil. After months of meaningless murder, the surviving Tutsi were at a decisive crossroads in the cycle of hate; they had the opportunity to extract a well-deserved revenge at the hands of their Hutu killers or to instead provide forgiveness. Left to Tell, the account of genocide survivor Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza, describes quite clearly how forgiveness-- not revenge-- and a reliance on the power of God is the only real way to overcome the anger, hate and pain of the cycle of hate. This truth she elucidates describes the only way any nation, community, or individual can overcome the crimes of the past and hope for a better futureImmacul&eacute;e's life had been destroyed. Her family, gone. Her friends, gone. Her neighbors had turned killers and been the ones to destroy her family. But rather than grow cold and ruthless towards her killers, Immacul&eacute;e made a remarkable choice to forgive, because she realized that murderers too are children of God who were caught up in a deceitful wave of evil. Because Immacul&eacute;e, led by God, was able to make this decision, she became intensely aware of the hand of God in her life; by His hand she was \"left to tell\" the tragic account of Rwanda and demonstrate the only solution to escape the pain of fostering hate- forgiveness.As a devout Catholic, Immacul&eacute;e's example is exemplar in how we must learn to treat each other as children of God. This story finds hope in the most hopeless of circumstances. One cannot help but view life just a little more differently after reading this account. This book is much more than worthwhile reading-- it constitutes one of the greatest moral lessons in the recent century as it demonstrates in fact that \"with God all things are possible\" (see forward). A Must Read I loved this book. It was a required read for a class I am taking. Before buying it I went to a local bookstore to check it out. I sat down and three hours later the bookstore was about to close and I was halfway through the book. She recounts her experience through the Rwandan Holocaust in a very frank yet personal manner. Her story of genocide is so much out of my world but while reading it I sometimes felt like I was there with her, running through the night or hiding in the bathroom. The book deals with mature subjects and should be taken into consideration before reading. Other than that I would recommend this book to everyone. Hate and vengeance spread more hate and vengeance and it's inspiring to read how she handles it. Great Left to Tell(ISBN 1-40190-896-9) Hay HouseBy Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza with Steve ErwinIn times when we wonder if light will triumph over darkness, Left to Tell will surely shed more light for your personal journey. Immacul&eacute;e lost most of her family in the 1994 genocide war in Rwanda, only to emerge as a light to all those seeking healing in a world torn apart by conflicting beliefs and war.\"Immacul&eacute;e's journey will undoubtedly change the way you view the power of faith--forever. It's a story of a love for God that was so strong that hatred and revenge were forced to dissolve in its presence.\" --Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, world-renowned inspirational speaker and best-selling author.Rahasya Poe, Lotus GuideTo Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social and Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems Lotus Guide Magazine Review Immaculee is a woman who survived an ordeal a person should never have to go through, but her total faith in God and her rosary was her strength. Her life had many miracles. I read all three books: \"Our Lady of Kibeho\", \"Led by Faith\" and \"Left to Tell\". They were all great. Left to Tell Immaculee's book \"Left to Tell\" is an inspirational story about the other side of the world where genocides, wars and battles still happen every day. Her experiences during the awful slaughter remind us to be aware of what is happening to our world these days and recognize that we are so blessed. While we exaggerate small issues in our lives, there are others in this world that undergoes tragic circumstances. Immaculee is an example of fortitude, courage and determination to overcome life's challenges.During this ordeal she discovers not only an amazing depth of faith in God but also the true meaning of forgiveness. I wept as reading Imaculee's message when she eventually meets the killer of her family: \"Forgiveness is all I have to offer.\" Her profound message is so meaningful to me, which conveys the triumph of the forgiving soul over the feeling of hatred and revenge. If a person like Immaculee who suffers lots of pains and bitterness can forgive her enemies, why don't we forgive our friends, our acquaintances for making harmless mistakes?Her moving descriptions of how she is able to build such a strong faith in God and her true feeling of how she learns to forgive during such a hard time make her story more powerful and engaging. This book gave me an opportunity to look back at myself, get in touch with my spiritual side in a more personal way and learn to forgive past offenses. Everyone who is seeking forgiveness, trying to forgive someone or struggling to go through hardships should read this wonderful book. It's a way to purify your soul. Purify your soul \"For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavillion: in the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.\"Psalm 27:5I've just read this awesome story. This is a sad story that's well written and clear, which is important since her story deals with a world gone mad and the supernatural, to which she fled to bear her suffering.In 1994, tensions between the two major tribes of Rwanda exploded into a horrendous killing spree--the majority Hutus waged war against the minority Tutsis. While the killing went on for three months, Immaculee Ilibagiza and seven other women hid in the 4' x 3' bathroom of an old and trusted Hutu family friend. All she had was the clothes on her back and the red and white rosary her father pressed into her hands as she left him for the last time telling her that her faith in God would protect her and for 91 excruciating days she prayed nearly unceasingly. What follows is a testimony to the power of prayer and the mercy of God. Those 91 days catapulted Immaculaee's faith into a spiritual dimension like none she'd ever known. Her intelligence and compassion shines through near-paralyzing fear and every moment holds the secret of life as she faces the battle that confronts us all--the battle between good and evil.I've read books by and about saints, and though Immaculaee doesn't consider herself a saint (even the greatest saints didn't consider themselves saints), she has all the qualities I've found in the great saints, the most important being a burning desire for God. For all of you who do not believe prayer can bear fruit, read this book and be amazed how one small miracle after another added up to one great miracle--her survival and this inspiring book.With Immaculee's prayers God made a cramped and tiny bathroom into his pavillion. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord. 40:11 This is one of the most moving stories I've ever read. (and the first book I've actually given a review on here.)Mankind is sickening when you think of the atrocities that we do to each other. Her story is a powerful lesson on \"hatred\" and evil in general. But even more powerful - was Immaculee's faith in God throughout her ordeal. I feel like she was truly sent here from a higher power - acting as God's anchor/life boat to the world in telling her story. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish the book went into more detail at times. Every angle and everything she went through in her story is so overwhelming - at times it seemed simplified as compared to what she really must've gone through.But that's not a criticism - just a comment that this book left me wanting more. I hope she writes more - there are so many angles and teachings I think she could give based on what she went through.I will definitely pass this book onto many.... Wished it was more in depth Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan HolocaustThis book is a must read, as it reflection of one woman's story of survival during one of the most bloodiest acts of genocide to happen in recent years. It is a gripping tale that provides the reader with an inspirational accounts of how one woman's faith and desire to live helped her to overcome overwhelming obstacles. It is hard to express into word to what extent this book has helped me to believe that anything can be achieve, so long as you are will to open yourself to forgiveness. For myself this book has really helped to bring a level of closure to some of my own personal problems. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. An Inspirational Book I first learned of this incredible woman, Immaculee Ilibagiza, on a PBS show and was so moved I wanted to read her story. She tells her story and the story of her culture portraying her joys and interest, as well as the events. Knowing the outcome made the book more exciting- that she lived through this holocaust and most of all the blessing of knowing how she is able to forgive. She speaks to universal love and acceptance and forgiveness that teaches me and I believe others, how to heal our wounds and the wounds of others. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. LLM Amazing and Beautifully written autobiography This book was amazing! It tells the true story of Immaculee IIibagiza who survived the Rwanda holocust. This book actually takes you inside her life before and after the Rwanda holocust.You will feel as if you are there in Rawanda during the terrible genocide.This is a book you will never forget and ponder long after you've finished reading it. I give this book five stars.I would give it more if i could.Reviewed by AOTR: Dee Dee M. Scott, author of, My Husband's Woman. WOW! Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust is an amazing book. Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza, a survivor of the horrible Rwandan genocide, does a very good job educating the people about the horrible acts that took place in her home country. When you read this book, you feel like you are amongst the carnage and the horrors that happened there. You feel the killers' breath and taunts like they are right behind you. The imagery that is painted into your mind by Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza gets you emotionally involved in her story.This book is very worth everyone's time because it will help you know how almost one million people were brutally murdered in just three months. It's something that we should all learn more about. Seeing as how the Rwandan Holocaust is something not known about that much we can really learn a lot by reading this amazing book. The author, Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza, captivates you from the very beginning and she will own your interest until you finish. I recommend this book to everyone. The compelling moral lesson that the author teaches will inspire everyone to love more. Do not pass this book over. Mending a Destroyed Heart I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I could not put down the book and managed to finish it in 2 days! My heart was beating so fast when I was reading the parts where she was in hiding...I felt as though I was there with her in that tiny bathroom.The author made me see that if she was able to forgive her family's killers, then I should be able to forgive those who hurt/offend me. She also showed me I need to be more vigilant in my prayers and never give up hope/faith in God because he always has a plan for each one of us even if we do not see it yet. Inspirational!",

         "The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine",
         "I love this book and highly recommend it! It is stock full of recipes that are well-organized. It is also full of advice and tips that have been a wonderful help to me. It does an excellent job explaining terms and explaing WHY certain ingredients are needed and what they do for the bread. And not only does it cover basic bread recipes, it also inclueds many other recipes that some higher-end machines are capable of handling: sweet breads, jams, etc.It does not have pictures, though. I don't mind, but some people might. Excellent resource Once I finally found a good machine (a Sunbeam) and got comfortable with turning out successful loaves I decided to try out some bread machine cookbooks. The first book I bought (\"Bread Machine Magic' by Rehberg and Conway) worked fabulously, and so I was excited to try more. I found Hensperger's \"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\" on the shelf with other bread machine books of my local bookstore. It stood out from the pack with such mouthwatering descriptions I could not wait to get it home and start trying it out. To my dismay, the most exciting sounding recipe turned out to be a dismal flop. I thought it might be a fluke and gave a few more recipes a try. I tried five recipes. Some rose up too high and then fell, others had poor texture, one turned out decently but was totally flavorless. This book was a real disappointment. After reading some of the reviews here I wonder, maybe if I tried the right recipe I might find one I enjoyed. However, 5 out of 5 of the loaves that came from this book weren't worth eating, and I don't want to waste the ingredients on such risky prospects. I've decided to consider the $21.95 I spent on this book as enough of a loss and I'm going to buy \"More Bread Machine Magic\" instead of taking another shot at this book. Beautiful descriptions but a flop in the \"oven\" I've had this book for almost ten years and it is falling apart from use. I use my bread machine(s) almost daily and I recommend this book to anyone looking for the ultimate bread machine recipe book. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the 2 lb recipes are iffy and tend to out-rise the machine - I always stick with the 1.5 lb measurements and they fill my Zojirushi machine perfectly.The recipes with starters are gold. I never liked straight bread machine recipes - they always tasted off to me somehow, unfinished, raw. Using a simple poolish or biga makes all the difference in the world. It was a revelation to me. When I'm feeling fancy I bake in a dutch oven or on a cast iron pizza pan, but I'm also totally fine with baking right in the machine. My family's favorite is the Olive Oil Bread. Before I got my newest bread machine we would spend $5 a loaf for Zingerman's bread several times a week - but when I make bread or dough in the machine using this book we are just as happy and save that money. It may not look as pretty but it's delicious and has such a well-developed flavor.The only bread I didn't like was the Mexican chocolate bread - just not my thing. I am not a fan of chocolate breads in general, though. I also find the selection of ryes a bit disappointing - my family's gold standard is Zingerman's Jewish rye and there really isn't anything close in this book.Get this book if you have a bread machine - you will not regret it! Indispensable - about to order my second copy since I used the first one to pieces I've only done a couple of recipes from this book, but my husband and son loved the results. The recipes that usually comes with a bread machine isn't the best so I knew I had to find an alternative. I just wish there were pictures in the book because I'm a sucker for pictures. Other than that I'm glad I bought it. Good Bread Book I bought this book when I ordered my first bread machine. My machine can make a 2 pound loaf and I really appreciate that all the recipes have 1.5 and 2 pound versions. I make about a loaf of bread a week and this is the only bread recipe book I have. I've yet to feel like I'm running out of new recipes to try. There are some I make over and over like \"Sour Cream Rye\" and \"Three-Seed Whole Wheat Bread\". Every recipe has turned out great. I did end up buying a set of measuring spoons that included a 1/2 Tablespoon. Most sets don't include this size, but a number of recipes call for 1/2 Tablespoon this or that. Buy this book with your new bread machine Have five bread machine cookbooks, this far outshines the rest. Nice variety of recipes, very useful information on the various manufacturers' machines, on-point troubleshooting suggestions. Recipes are generally offered for two different sized loaves to accommodate differing machines and appetites, each recipe has a brief history on its origins or development as well as suggestions for use, my only wish is that it was available with a spiral binding so it would lie flat on the counter. Excellent book, a bargain at twice the price! Hands down the best So far we haven't even begun to even scratch the surface of whats in the book,It was a christmas gift for my girlfriend. We made the Cracked Wheat bread to the letter in an Emeril by T-fal bread maker using the 2 lb. It was way too much, it pushed the cover up and the upper third was raw. Then used the 1/12 pound and it was better but sitll a bit too much. But all we had to do was slice off the top and the rest of the bread was just great! Toasted well and the sandwiches were awesome. So far so good This is an excellent cookbook for use with your bread machine. Huge variety of different types of breads. If you enjoy knowing a bit of history behind what you bake there are short comments before each recipie. Lots of how to's and tips scattered through the book. It's much more than just recipies, get one! Well worth the price This book is amazing. I will be making baking for years before I have to repeat a recipe! WOW Have barely scratched the surface and already learned much that I needed to know about bread machnes. HIghly recommend the book Novice Purchased to learn the craft of bread making - Great Instruction Manual I got this book for Christmas along with a Zojirushi bread machine. The two make a great combination! Anything I have tried from this book has turned out great. A favorite so far is the biga recipe--it's a kind of starter. This book makes you want to experiment every day! my children who received this book with the oyster bread maker said it was a must have sooo many recipees!! must have Even helps you create your own recipes. Simple to follow directions and concepts. Helps you create your own breads and cakes. Tons of great recipes made simple. I adore this cookbook. I knew I would because I love this author's slow cooker cookbooks, but this is making the learning curve so much easier for me and the breadmaker. Sour cream bread, honey white bread, it's all been good. I can't wait to get into focaccia! So much bread, so little time This book has been great and has taught me a great deal but if I had to do it again, I am not sure I would have bought it. The recipes are great and so is her advice but I feel like the book is poorly laid out and I resent that she only gives you measurements in volume when weight is universally recognized as a superior way to measure for baking. I find the book hard to use too. Her dinner roll recipe (which is awesome) and alternative directions to rolling out the dough are in two different places in the book but she doesn't give a page number to finding the rolling directions. Finally I wrote the page to the alternate rolling directions on the recipe page. She should have done that for me. I find it difficult to find a recipe even the ones I know are in the book. Nothing is given its rightful name. Pulla is called Cardamon Easter Braid. Why couldn't she just call it Pulla like everyone else so I could look it up in the index? With the measurement issue, I am new to baking and I can't tell yet if a loaf needs more water or more flour just by looking at it. It is better for me to have exact measurements as I learn and develop an eye. When I started out on this hobby I bought a scale to insure that I would have my measurements exact but with Hensperger's recipes I have to convert the measurements myself. It can be confusing too. Some bread flour conversion charts differ from others too. She does give conversion advice (not per a recipe but in a separate section) but it is cumbersome to stop and do the math. My ADD kicks in and it is so easy for me to make a mistake. Weighing is so much easier too and so much less messy. She has a great chapter on dough enhancers and she does give directions to use commercially bought \"dough enhancer\" on a few recipes but I wish she had given advice for which dough enhancer one could use on each of her recipes as an option and how it would change the results. I have used that new Red Star yeast with dough enhancers and was impressed but it is way too expensive. I bought some of the dough enhancer ingredient listed (lecithin, barley malt, ascorbic acid) in Hensperger's book but I wish I knew exactly which ones should (or even could be) used in each recipe. Again that information would have been so easy to give. According to her most loaves can use at least one of the big three of lecithin, malt or ascorbic acid. They make the dough more forgiving. If she had tied her advice to each recipe it would have been more relevant and easier to absorb completely. For all I know this is the best book out there. I only own a few and this one is the most comprehensive. At least she talked about the enhancers. None of her recipes have failed (which is huge) but I wish this book contained more information. If anyone knows a bread cook book that give weight as well as volume and with recommendations of dough enhancers to use with each recipe, I would love to know so I could buy it. Great But Needs Weight Measurements It is a wonderful addition to any collection of cook books. I have several books this is by far a surprise it is thick and packed full of good ideas read read read This book is fantastic! I had given up on my bread machine because my bread didn't turn out right. After reading the how-to info in this book and then trying some of her recipes, I figured it out. Now I use her book at least twice a week. I try all kinds of recipes. We love some, others are not to our taste, but I've enjoyed trying them. I've recommended this book to anyone who wants to successfully use their bread machine. Great Book for using your Bread Machine!! I bought this book as a gift for my youngest daughter who is just starting to enjoy fresh bread from a bread machine. On her days off she prefers to do everything from scratch the hard way. On the days when she is working, her family can enjoy a variety of fresh homemade breads which they love, with very little effort on her part. She used to use frozen doughs, but machine methods are more cost effective and varied in breads. The best thing about these bread recipes are that they work either with the machine or by hand kneading. This book has even inspired my teenaged granddaughter to give bread making a try. A nice collection of recipes for a variety of machines Recipes are for one-and-a-half and two pound loaves only. I could find no methodology or formula in the book for adapting recipes to make smaller loaves. How much more serviceable this volume would be, and how much wider its audience, had the author included a third column with each recipe giving directions to make one pound loaves, as Donna Rathmell German does in all her bread-machine cookbooks! Further, be aware that this book is a tome, very heavy and awkward to handle.Not for use with the very popular Mini Zo (Zojirushi BB-HAC10 Home Bakery 1-Pound-Loaf Programmable Mini Breadmaker). Not for use by people with manual disabilities. No recipes for one-pound loaves This is a GREAT book. Tells everything anyone would want to know about bread, bread making and bread ingredients. Lots of research went into the writing of this book. One of my \"go to\" books. Would highly recommend even if you aren't interested in baking. Just good reading. everything about bread WOW...what a cookbook!!! I'm so glad I got it because the choices of breads seem endless! I'm eating walnut (yeast) bread as I type this. The crust is crunchy and it's so delicious. The book size is 8 X 9 X 2\" with 643 pages so it's a great value and made me glad that I have a cookbook stand. This is a lifetime of treasured bread recipes and full of comments to make you an expert on the subject. Two sizes of loaves are listed and have separate measurements. A thoughtfully planned book that's loaded with info. Don't even consider another book because this is the one to have!!! The ONLY one you need! This is a fabulous book for anyone with a bread machine, especially if you're like me and have little prior bread-making experience. Any type of bread you could want to make is in this book. So far I've only tried a few recipes, but they've all been delicious. Aside from the recipes, all the information about bread-making is invaluable - specifics to using bread machines, the properties of different types of flour, the chemistry behind making a successful loaf of bread, why a loaf didn't turn out right and how to fix it, etc. One of my favorite tips so far is about white whole wheat flour, which is made from white wheat rather than red wheat. It's a whole grain flour, but it's lighter in texture than regular whole wheat, so it can be substituted for all-purpose flour and makes loaves with a similar texture to a white bread. One thing I don't like about the book is that many of the recipes in the Whole Grain chapter aren't 100% whole grain - a few of them even contain only a small amount of whole grain flour. Also, from what I've seen so far, it looks like most of the recipes are designed to create light, fluffy breads. Nothing wrong with that type of bread, but sometimes I want something with more density to it, especially in a whole grain bread. Some of the other chapters (country breads, herb breads, fruit and nut breads, etc.) also include whole grain and multi-grain recipes, so if that's your main interest make sure you look through the whole book. Despite the few things I don't like about this book, I feel that the information is so helpful that once I've tried a few more recipes and experimented a bit, I'll be able to adjust recipes successfully and maybe create my own. Great info, delicious recipes I love my bread machine because my husband makes the most amazing breads that make the house smell wonderful. I expected this book to provide him with recipes that require the breadmachine to do the work but just about every recipe requires taking the dough out of the machine, kneeding it and bake it in the oven. What's up with that? I thought, \"that's not what the bread machine was designed to do\". So I'm stuck with it! In a busy world the bread machine was designed to give us fresh breads investing very little of our time other than piling up the ingredients and letting it do the work.Oh well! I didn't expect to be kneeding! This is a huge recipe book filled with hundreds of bread recipes for every type of bread you can think of and a whole lot that you never knew existed. I have tried several of the recipes and they have all turned-out reasonably well.Many of the recipes in the book require a great deal of manual intervention and shaping, so sure you can make croissant dough in your automatic bread machine--if you transfer the dough in and out of the machine several times, coat butter bits with flour and freeze them, roll out the dough and shape it--but should you? There are also a lot of quick-bread recipes that are often easier to just mix and bake traditionally. In the end, it seems like 75% of the recipes are either so manually intensive that your automatic bread machine is essentially just a nice place to let dough rise or they are so simple without using a bread machine that the machine is just an unnecessary step.While there is no shortage of recipes in the book, there is a shortage of a few other things: the cheap paperback binding won't lay flat, there is not a single picture in the book; and, most serious, the index is horrible and simply a listing of the recipe names. This is a huge problem in a nearly 700-page recipe book. You cannot find recipes by main ingredients: for instance \"Orange Bread with White Chocolate, Apricots, and Walnuts\" is listed in the index under \"orange\" but it is not listed under \"white,\" \"chocolate,\" \"apricots,\" or \"walnuts.\"If this book were limited to only recipes that are both reasonable to make in an \"automatic\" bread machine and that benefit in some way from doing so; and also contained a usable index and maybe a few pictures, I would give it a much higher rating. Not User Friendly I have this book and Bread Machine Magic. They are both good books. This has everything in it that the other has plus some more complex breads. I would get this book if you are going to be baking bread with lots of ingredients like all kinds of fruits, nuts, whole wheat breads, and if you are going to try out different types of sour dough breads (which you can only mix in the machine and need to bake in the oven). So if you are planning on doing a lot of complex stuff outside of the bread machine itself i would get this book..if you are going to stick to basics and just make really good bread in the machine itself mostly i would get Bread Machine Magic. Also on a side note this book is so thick that the binding tends to want to break if you stretch the binding out too much...which happened on mine because i kept going back to a few or a couple recipes over and over which split the binding. A good book for a kitchen library This book has it all! We got it before our new breadmaker arrived. It not only has tons of great recipes, but troubleshooting solutions to common problems, general information about different flours, etc., a great learning tool for beginners. Excellent Book! I just received this book, and I love the subtle sweetness and hardiness of this one recipe. The whole book is worth it for this one recipe: The Cornmeal Honey bread. I'm confident that any bread maker can bring out the mastery behind this recipe. (However, the Panasonic breadmaker, the only one this company sells, makes such a flawless crust, you want to cry that you just tried something that can't possibly be made better.)My biggest problem is that there's no nutritional facts here. Maybe the author didn't want to scare his readers and earn negatives points that way, so the nutritional facts were never mentioned. Although it's clear that this book isn't for the health nut, to promote a sound sense of proportion, the book should have included an idea of how many calories each slice is. I mean, we're handling heavy substances, like buttermilk, butter, eggs, gluten, etc.; I think we should know these things, if your aim is health or not. For most of us, out of sight means out of mind, so information like this should be present. I don't want to have to do the calculations myself, so I, being a health nut, would like to know how much of any one bread I can have that's within my proportion and daily allowance. I want 5 stars, but I can't... The recipes and information about breads and flours are extensive. It's fun reading.Major weakness: The recipes are written in a small font on a medium green background. Even with my normal reading glasses I have to use a magnifying glass to distinguish numbers in the fractions of cups.This means that I will have to type the recipe and print it out in an easily readable font size. I will not be able to assemble the ingredients straight from the book. One major weakness! Recipes are a little different than other bread machine recipes, but the results are terrific. I really love the bread. The brioche bread was a wonderful surprise. It's a great, quick alternative to the longer overnight traditional method. Fantastic recipes Bought a bread machine to save money and make specialty breads?...then buy this book - PERIOD! Great tips and tricks, along with recipes, that help make the bread machine mystery come alive with taste! Worth the price of admission... This is a great book with excellent recipes. All the recipes I have tried so far worked very well in my Zojirushi machine. Great book The content of this book is wonderful, however the quality of the physical book itself is poor and inappropriate for a kitchen cookbook. I have mine only several weeks and the binding is broken and pages are falling out. Such a shame that such great contents are ruined by cheap production.I use the recipes in my Cuisinart CBT-200 bread machine and everything so far has turned out great. This book has a section on breadmachines, however the Cuisinart is not included. No issue, the recipes work fine! Great Content, POOR book construction I truly enjoy using this cookbook. Hensperger takes the time to explain the difference between yeasts, which makes a difference with this book. The recipes I've tried have been delightful, and there is an excellent variety. The majority of recipes call for bread flour, and there is frequent use of gluten. But don't worry, there are gluten-free recipes included. Excellent bread machine book I just bought my first bread machine, and I thought I would mess up more than we'd be able to eat. Despite my mistakes, everything - from pizza dough, hamburger buns and cinnamon rolls to whole wheat and sandwich breads - has been fabulous. I can't say enough good stuff about this book.[...], Beth Hensperger's book and my Sunbeam 5891 machine, we haven't bought a loaf of bread since we got the bread maker. It's actually easier to throw the ingredients in the machine and turn it on than it is to run to the store to get some. And it all tastes much better and is healthier than what you can buy at the grocery. All the recipes I've tried from this book have turned out perfectly! Great book This book made my life with my bread machine simple and successful. I don't think the instructions that come with bread machines are nearly as extensive as what you need to be really successful with the equipment.This book makes it all simple and successful. I love the recipes too. This book is a MUST HAVE if you are new to bread machines. Excellent book This is a great bread machine cookbook. The recipes help the kitchen challenged, like myself, make a wonderful loaf of fresh warm bread, that smells & taste great! Bread Machine Cookbook Really like this book. It's fun to sit down and pick a new and exciting recipe to try for my husband,myself, friends and family. There are many different bread styles to choose from than can help inspire new meal options. My current favorite is C.R.O.W.W. bread which stands for cinnamon, raisin, oat, walnut, and whole wheat. Yummy bread that takes me back to the says with my grandma. Another nice thing is trying different flours and ingredients broadening my my horizons. The only criticism. I would have is mot having weights of the ingredients versus cup. Thank you Beth for a great resource. Yum... I love whole wheat bread. I had tried to make soft moist whole wheat bread for months before buying this book. I got recipes for the oven and converted them to the bread machine, and I got recipes for the bread machine and used them \"as is\". I tried bread cook books, bread machine cook books, and the internet. Every time I baked whole wheat bread it turned out dry and hard.Since I've gotten this book I haven't made a dry hard loaf of bread. The instructions are so easy to understand, and make such great bread. I can make bread with any kind of flour I want and it turns out soft and moist. This is a must-have for any bread lover! Never bake dry bread again! I bought this book from Amazon a few months ago when I also bought a breadmaker (cuisinart). I LOVE this book. I find myself reading it, just for fun. Beth Hensperger is a great writer and the introduction to the book was very helpful. I also really enjoy the comments she makes on every recipe. The book is divided into chapters based on bread type. Every recipe I have tried is fabulous. No tweaking necessary. I have recently become obsessed with the artisan loaves and they are so good it is like you went to an upscale bakery and bought the bread. The best thing about the book is that it really motivates you to use the machine to its maximum potential. Regular breads, wheat breads, artisan breads, sweet breads, pizza dough, non-yeast breads and even jam.I originally bought the breadmaker because I am trying to get off the \"food grid\" as much as I can (partially motivated by the book \"In Defense of Food\"). I want to feed my family food that is as pure and natural as possible. After studying ingredient lists on commercially prepared breads, I realized the stuff sold in grocery stores has little resemblance to actual bread. Since I do not have time to make bread by hand, I bought a bread machine.Since purchasing the machine and this book, I buy very little bread at the store. It is so easy and satisfying (and so much healthier) to make it myself.Buy this book! The best bread machine cookbook ever This is by far the best cookbook I have bought for my bread maker. The other cookbooks had really strange recipes that I would never even want to try (not sure why I bought them...). But this cookbook is wonderful.There is a lot of helpful information in the book, such as the Bread Machine Baker's Hint on Dough Enhancers, that many people are likely to find helpful (I did).But the recipes are what shine. There is a recipe for any type of bread you might want to make. Seriously. Want a recipe for Prune Bread? They've got it (okay, I admit I haven't tried that one, so I have no idea how good it is).My absolute favorite recipe in the entire book is their banana bread recipe. It is incredibly moist and dense. Any time my bananas start to get too ripe to eat I pull out this book and turn to page 543. When I'm in the mood, I've modified the recipe by adding about 3/4 C of pumpkin and a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice. Good gracious, but that's good!Another recipe I love is their carrot bread recipe. Generally speaking, I can't stand carrots or carrot cake. This bread, however, is incredible (it's on page 558 of my book).My only complaint is that I think there are too many recipes. Sometime I find it hard to pick one, simply because there are so many to choose from. But don't let that stop you from getting this book if you have a bread maker that is collecting dust. Only one complaint... I have been using bread machines since they were first introduced, and so, when I was given this cookbook, I wasn't sure that it would add anything to my repertoire. Boy, was I wrong. Beth Hensperger covers such a wide range of recipes and techniques that even veterans will be hooked. And beginners will be given a gentle lead into the world of fresh baked bread. If you drool over the specialty breads in the bakery or bread section in a high-end supermarket, you've found your cookbook, even if you're new to bread baking.Hensperger provides basic recipes for white and wheat bread; however, you can find those types of recipes anywhere. The strength of this cookbook is her expansion on the classics: Sour Cream Bread, Maple Buttermilk Bread, Vienna Bread, Three-Seed Whole Wheat Bread, Whole Wheat Challah, and Cracked Wheat Bread. She includes ethnic and country breads from around the world, multi- and whole-grain breads, sweet breads, sour doughs (including a German beer starter for rye bread), savory breads flavored by herbs and cheeses, and gluten-free. Some recipes are mixed and baked entirely within the machine while others require the dough setting for hand-shaping. (Most of the recipes can be hand-shaped, if desired.) Another note: Recipes call for vital wheat gluten, but I always omit that since my local grocery store doesn't carry it. My breads still turn out great.Many recipes are not of the load-and-walk-away variety; they require either preparation, as with a starter, or a kitchen timer, to do or add something at a specific point. Bakers who bought their machines for convenience -- to make bread while they are at work, for instance -- may find that these particular recipes are impractical. The biggest problem with the more complex recipes is that you must know your own bread machine. If an ingredient is supposed to be added, say, \"ten minutes into the second knead cycle,\" as is the case with brioche, then you had better know whether your machine actually kneads dough twice. For special occasions, however, the specialty breads that require a little extra work make fantastic additions to the table. And there are plenty of recipes here for the person who does not want to spend much time with preparation.If you want to branch out from the standard bread machine recipes, this book is a must-have for your kitchen. If, however, you want just a few recipes, with some variation, I suggest gettingBread Machine Magic, Revised Edition: 138 Exciting Recipes Created Especially for Use in All Types of Bread Machines. This cookbook is definitely the more comprehensive and the more ambitious of the two.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann For ambitious beginners to master bakers, this bread book has it all I love the Bread Machine Cook Book I purchased. There are hundreds of pages withan index making anything one wants easy to find. BREAD MACHINE COOK BOOK Years ago, when I got my first bread machine, I was lucky enough to discover two of the best books to go with it: Electric Bread, and More Electric Bread. (The first is listed as by Suzanne Nightingale, the second by I.C.E. Staff). While not every recipe is to my taste, I've never had a loaf of their devising fail. And, I notice Amazon has tons of used copies for sale, starting at a penny! You simply cannot go wrong with these, they're the best! for those of you who were disappointed with this... The type face used on the recipes is too small to read. I need to use a magnifying glass! The print is too small I have started using my bread machine again thanks to The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook. It must have some kind of magic in it because every loaf I have tried has been amazing. I find I can only use the 1 1/2 pound loaf recipe in my 2 pound machine because the loaves come out huge. HUGE.I love this book so much, I bought two more copies to give to my best friends. One of them never made anything but sourdough. He was a sourdough snob. He made my very favorite recipe, Sour Cream Bread and made two loaves that same night. One for bread and one for cinnamon rolls.I've never seen someone so excited over a loaf of bread. It really is an unbeatable loaf. Just this one recipe is worth the price of the book alone. If you don't make any other recipe, make this one. It's perfect for a peanut butter sandwich, french toast, or just spread with real butter. Yum.Update - 12/10/07I made the Peach jam recipe and OMG, it was amazing. I used frozen peaches instead of fresh. Do try the jam in the machine. You won't be sorry. Best bread machine cookbook ever! I have tried very few of the recipes in this book. The reason is, well, I am lazy. The book is written for machines that produce 1.5 or 2 lbs loaves. My family is small so I opted for a Zojirushi Mini that makes 1 lb loaves. NOW, I am perfectly capable of doing the calculations to divide the 2 lb recipes in half, but I just don't care to do so. I grab my Bread Machine Magic cookbook because it has tables in it for the ingredients and is set up for 1 lb. Reading the table is so fast, that I can toss together bread in just a bit longer than it takes me to set up the coffee maker. And I have enjoyed the outcome of the recipes, so that is my GO-TO recipe book. One of these days I will branch out and try more of these recipes for variety or something special, but I have a feeling that my BMM cookbook will be filled with notes and comments long before this book is pulled off the shelf. If you have a full size machine or don't mind doing calculations, it's probably really awesome. Satisfactory cookbook True, it may have everything in the world about bread, butI found this book tedious and not at all what I was lookingfor. I wanted simple bread recipies and this &#34;ain't it&#34;. Bread Machine Book I've had this book for over 7 years now, and while I've made a dozen or so of the recipies, it was worth it just for those.However - has anyone else had trouble with the White Whol Wheat Bread recipie on page 127? Every time I've tried to make it, it comes out as a dense squat loaf that's clearly not cooked all the way through. I've tried adding yeast to the recipie as I thought that would make it rise better, to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Great Book - BUT ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION! Loved this book! Just got a Bread Machine and ordered this at the same time. I have already tried many of the receipes and my family has loved them. I highly recommend it. Bread Machine Cookbook I received this cookbook and a Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker for Christmas. So far I have made two loaves of bread and a batch of strawberry jam, and I have spent the greater part of today reading the recipes and information in this cookbook. I am giving this five stars because I am confident that I will be getting the most out of my machine because of this cookbook!This book goes way beyond just variations of white and wheat bread. Additionally, there are many traditional breads from early America, the British Isles, Europe and the Mediterranean represented here. There is even a recipe for steamed Chinese buns called David SooHoo's Bao. Additionally, there are recipes for pasta dough, jams, chutney and quick breads. There are many many recipes that do not require anything more for you to do than to measure the ingredients into the pan. But there are also recipes for dinner rolls and hand-shaped breads. A bread machine does the most efficient job of kneading dough, even better than my stand mixer. Unless you have been working as a baker your entire life or kneading dough several times a week since you were eight, a bread machine is they way to go simply because of the way it kneads and helps you develop the dough.There is a wealth of information in here, from the history of the recipe to techniques and hints to help you along, as well as technical information that will help you understand what works, what doesn't work, and why.I love that I can make my own jam, I can avoid high fructose corn syrup altogether, and if I find the right pectin, I can make jam that is reduced in sugar content. I love that I have such a variety of healthy whole wheat and whole grain recipes from which to choose. I like the idea of making quick breads, because I can mix and bake with one machine instead of two, and clean up is easy.In addition to the recipes you can use in your machine, there are also recipes for: ways to use extra bread, day old bread, spreads for your fabulous bread, flavored butters and honeys, etc.This cookbook is well organized. There is a general index, which is helpful for example, if you want to go over your options for using oats, or spelt flour. There is also a recipe index, so you can quickly find the page number of an old favorite.Unlike a previous reviewer states, you do not have to use just SAF yeast for these recipes. The quantity needed for this yeast may differ from the quantity needed for other types of yeast, that's all.My only disappointment is that there are no illustrations for about six of the roll and loaf shaping techniques described. As there is such a wealth of other information here, and as I will be trying new recipes from this book for the next couple of years, I didn't allow that little point to knock my review down to four stars.To sum up: whether you bought this so that you will have plenty of recipes to use and you'll never have to knead or touch unbaked dough to have a home baked loaf, or if you want to wring every possible use out of your bread machine and don't mind getting your hands in the dough, this is a useful cookbook. Outstanding - a \"must have\" if you own any bread machine. I have really enjoyed this book and it has been a great resource to make great bread with my bread machine! Great! Used recipe for beer bread and dough was so thick it burned up motor in our bread machine.Be careful with this recipe. Beer Bread Problem I purchased this book after reading the reviews. It is incredible and has so many recipes that I want to try, plus giving me tips on how to recreate some great breads I've eaten in other areas of the country. It's a great addition to any cookbook collection. Love this cookbook I purchased this book along with the Zo bread machine and just love it. I have only had the book about a month and have used 4 different recipes which have all turned out perfect. There is every kind of bread you could imagine in this book. Can't wait to try them all!

I'd seriously like to applaud the person that designed that! So subtle. So evocative of the story.One of my best presents ever! An extraordinary cover design in hardcover with a silken bookmark which helps with the awesome footnotes! I'm such an English Major geek!Of course I read the book first nearly 40 yrs ago. And have re-read it many times since.Guess it is an acquired taste. ;) Loved everyting about this edition! Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel. Pleasantly of course. Surprisingly Fun and Fast Read ! This cautionary tale of sensuality, excess, vanity, and self-love is slow-going for today's readers, used to a brisker pace of writing. The story is wonderful but could have been told in far fewer words; however, word count excess wasn't important in the era in which Wilde wrote and lived his own unique brand of literature, art, and life.Wonderful witty, sarcastic and caustic writing of course, all being Wilde's trademarks. Not an easy book for modern readers Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book! Great Read This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.Very enjoyable story from a witty author. The story of Every Person great book hard to read because print was so small the picture of Dorian Gray I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah Oscar Wilde, an aritst of Beauty, broke the mold of his time The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down. Gothic Classic In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a true classic. A pretty picture Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them. A Work of Self Condemnation The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills. However, towards the middle of the book, the plots descends into a lengthy tiring description of artifacts (musical instruments, stones and jewelry, portraits and so on) that really break the rhythm of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was quite fed up with this inventory of objects. The book ends with a moral, which I found to be quite void and meaningless, as I did not accept the book's premise - That all sins and corruption will manifest in one's physical image. A literature classic, but not quite what I expected This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \"lavishly illustrated\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \"annotations\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \"reader's\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources. I heartily recommend this edition for readers seeking a scholarly edition for research purposes. I frankly cannot see how it can be superseded.\"A very generous endorsement, but for those who are seeking a scholarly edition, you will only find it in the original hardback. Kindle Edition/Reader's Edition: not annotated or illustrated Hell can be fun! A book choc-full of bon mots and little phrases to use in everyday life. Wilde was genius personified. Carry this with you always. Essential reading Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \"youth\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking. Beauty is skin deep, but vanity goes to the heart This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better. The Picture of Dorian Gray All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\" \"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces. All art should not be useless. Book is in great condition and received it quickly. The only CON is the book was really small. If the description said it was a gift book size, then it is my fault for missing it in the description. *** I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \"which came first, the chicken or the egg\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul? Beauty is only skin deep I can't add much to what has already been said in other review, but I can add this - this is a book well worth buying. I started reading \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in the form of the book that was issued by the Folio Society - this is the standard text of the book. Halfway into the book I ordered the annotated , uncensored version and started reading that version. I am planning on going back to the beginning of the uncensored version. The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it! WELL WORTH BUYING How can you give it less than 5 stars? Its an awesome title and the best part, it's free! There's no way it can get better! Awesome title I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.' A Classic Story.... The story of Dorian Gray is one that everyone knows, yet knowing what the premise, and most likely how the story ends doesn't detract from this amazing read. This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\", or \"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like. This is a book that should be in class rooms more often. Timeless A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot. Makes you think a bit about life, but was entertaining, and a neat mystery. Read great on my iPhone Kindle app and on my Kindle 4. Great story with depth Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\"\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\"\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\"\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\"\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\"\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\"- \"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\"- \"They were defeated.\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing `Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame The picture of Dorian Gray may have been shocking for its taboo innuendoes when it was first published late in the 19th century, but to a modern reader, almost seeking out an element of that shameful pleasure a well written novel of vanity and desire might evoke, such a thrill-seeker will be a bit disappointed here. That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray... The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\"; \" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\"; \"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\" ; \"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\" ; \" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\" And \" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could. Cavalier and irreverent statement on life and society I READ IT IN HIGHSCHOOL AND JUST REREAD IT AND NOW THAT SOMEONE DID NOT MAKE ME READ IT I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH MORE IF YOU NEVER READ IT NOWS THE TIME loved it! First piece I read by Oscar Wilde and it did not disappoint me! A great tale on the tragedy of youth Brilliant! First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book. Very Good Story but Deep Will someone please tell me why this \"uplifting classics\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \"cover\"? I find that rather offensive... Dorian Gray as Thomas Jefferson? The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\" To Gain the Whole World, but Lose the Soul Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again. A great work! Dorian Gray deserved to die a lonely, bitter man. What fascinates me about his story is the way in which he was hammered on by Lord Henry and yet found no room for the good influence of others. Fascinating tale. Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion. So beautiful and so vile The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \"responsibly\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \"own sake\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist. A philosophical inquest into deleterious effects of sinful and vulgar living It was a gift for my daughter. She was very pleased with the item and would recommend ordering from here again. Great find Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people. poisonous by beauty First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order. Timeless classic? I hardly think so. I would imagine that there is not a very large chance you would findthis book in the waiting room of any plastic surgeon's office. Anexample of a story that suggests be careful of what you wish for. Ayoung man makes a deal to keep himself young and youthful looking.Unfortunately there is a secret associated with this that is hard tohide. Free SF Reader The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish. Boring No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as. The characters found in the book, from Dorian to the unimportant drug dealers in the alley - they just make you engage in the plot of the story.everyone should read this book - it's a gem. probably the best book in the world. I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \"deal with the devil\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-) Great, Great Read! This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy. Fantastic, haunting The Picture of Dorian Gray is a book that truly makes you think about the possibilities of reality. Along with the supernatural qualities, the novel dives into the realm of society and hints to us that we should really think about who we surround ourselves with. Our peers It's difficult to know the purpose of this edition of Wilde's novella. I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling. A puzzling edition Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure. Picture of Dorian Gray This is an APOLOGIA (I suppose) to Oscar Wilde on behalf of all those who rated his wonderful book lowly. It just so happens to be my favorate book, and I looked so see if there was anyone who didn't like it. Quite horrified, and rather losing my faith in Humanity (or HUMANITAD) I thought: I must write an essay myself!To be honest, I am sure that dear old Oscar would not have been terribly upset some people didn't like his book, for his works are, let's be honest, only truly understood by those who share something of his divine temprement (like me!).Let me now say why I like it.I first read the picture when I was at school (vague memories of having written a review for this book before, have I?) - and, quite honestly, it is the most beautiful and cleverset thing in the world (bookwise).Heaens above, if you can't enjoy a book that is so obviously about pleasure (in a very Epicurean, spiritual way, ye moral detractors, mark you!), what are you doing engaging in the Epicurean pleasure of reading at all? Give up! You do not have a soul to be corrupted! APOLOGIA This book will keep you reading until you reach the end. I also makes you think about how the things that you do May impact on others and on your oneself. Dorian Gray The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images. Vanity The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf! Great story with amazing insights. In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \"dandy\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can. The man can write. Man, can the man write! This is one of the best books I have ever read. The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read. A Masterpiece Oscar Wilde truly had a way with words. The flow of the book is like poetry. Whilst some may claim the characters lack depth I would argue that one doesn't read a book like this for the depth of characters or plot; It's more about feelings, descriptions and passions. Just go and buy it. The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow. Provides a gruesome tale of vanity and egoism, a great choice for a book report. Great. Although the entire book is solid, the dialog in the first chapter should be required reading. The opening chapter can't be beat Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross. The Picture of Dorian Gray Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate. \"Vanity, definitely my favorite sin\" I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.The Picture of Dorian Gray The Picture of Dorian Grey by Oscar Wilde I did not enjoy this story. I really really wanted to. I tried very hard but in the end I was just plain bored. When I realized I was wasting my time I moved on. Could not finish this The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself. Well Told I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent! Great Book Oscar Wilde makes for an enjoyable read with his incessant and undeniable penchant for dry and cutting wit. He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde. Wilde Is the Master of Wit As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls. What does the picture of YOUR soul look like? With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too! Beauty, sin, and vanity - oh my! Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading. Forever Young Dorian Gray is not a kid book by any stretch of the imagination. No swordfights, no prince and princess, no happy ending. Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera. Save Dorian Gray for later. Pardon me, what were they thinking? A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable. A novel worth a thousand acclaims...",

         "A wonderful Jane Austen book. This is one of my favorite books for the time period and the wit that is spoken through out the whole book. Of course the book gives so much more detail than the movie so I definitely say read or listen to the book before watching the movie! Sense and sensibility... SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a story about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are as different as night and day. Elinor represents &quot;sense&quot; - thoughtful, considerate and calm, while Marianne is &quot;sensibility&quot;: wild, emotional, and talented. The story opens with the death of Old Mr. Dashwood, who leaves his estate to his nephew Mr. Dashwood (the father of Elinor and Marianne). Mr. Dashwood is about to die as well; he passes the estate to his son by his first wife, John Dashwood. Unfortunately, he has nothing of value to leave his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, 19-years-old; Marianne, 17; and Margaret, 13), though he does manage to get John Dashwood to promise to look after them. But John Dashwood's selfish wife, Fanny, convinces him to give very little. And so, Mrs. Dashwood moves them to Barton, where they live humbly in a cottage on her distant cousin, Sir John Middleton's, land.Before their move, Elinor had met and fallen in love with Fanny's younger brother Edward Ferrars. But Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars are much too snobby to let their relationship prevail. When they moved to the countryside, the two are further separated. Meanwhile, Marianne's romances are just blossoming in Barton. She gains the admiration of Colonel Brandon, but she prefers young, dashing Willoughby, who helps her home one day when she fell and twisted her ankle. This however proves disastrous, as Willoughby abandons Marianne for wealthy Miss Sophia Grey after a long, intimate friendship. Elinor is also suffering from love-loss. She discovers that Edward had been engaged for four years to Miss Lucy Steele, a distant relative of Mrs. Jennings (Sir John Middleton's mother-in-law). At this point, &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem to coincide and we learn that we must have both &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; in a balanced, corroborated manner to have a truly blissful life.The story is very interesting and entertaining, though Austen tended to drone a lot between events. In my opinion, she spent too much time trying to convey Elinor's judgement during parties and other social gatherings (which was wayyyy too often). On the whole, this was a wonderful book, full of fun and surprises (especially at the end!). I highly recommend this book to people at or above the age of 14 (which is how old I am, and I'm telling you it was a bit of a stretch for me - or maybe it was just that I was a little impatient to get my AR reading points). My only advice is have patience, prepare for a lot of rereading (things can get kinda confusing - there were a little too many characters for my comfort), and to watch the movie (fabulous!) afterward. Enjoy! A really nice story but Austen seemed to drag on a bit... The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \"Mansfield Park,\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \"Lectures on Literature\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \"Sense and Sensibility,\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \"Mansfield Park\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published. By way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \"Mansfield Park.\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Still, it is a delightful and a pleasant read. Great Read I gave the CD of Sense and Sensibility to my daughter-in-law, who is a big Jane Austen fan. Today I got the loveliest thank-you-note from her. It makes her long drives so much better and she says she is now a CD (rather than radio) fan. I only hope the other Austen novels come out as CDs soon...rather than cassettes. Wonderful gift I was so excited to find this penguin classic on amazon prime. good book, great price. great deal Wasn't quite what my wife was thinking about when she ordered it but will try again. Actually she found out that she had the wrong author. Book One of Jane Austen's best novels. It start it but you can't put it down. I just love this book. Sense and Sensability is the best I've always loved Jane Austen's books...I love the rich culture, refined manners and etiquette, the polite romances, and the author's subtle and witty sense of humor. Her books make me laugh, sometimes make me cry, but always leave me with a smile.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood; two girls raised well, but reduced to poverty at the death of their father. They each have met the man they want to marry, and are both convinced that the young men feel the same. Everything seems to be going along smoothly...or does it? Both of their romances collapse, and they are left to deal with them sensibly. However, both stories end surprisingly, giving each girl her happy, although not necessarily expected, ending.The copy of Sense and Sensibility I read was the Insight Edition by Bethany House Publishers...in addition to the original classic story, they have added footnotes throughout the book, explaining details about the culture and history, the films based on the book, Jane Austen herself, etc. I found them to make the book even more interesting, even though I already enjoyed the story for itself. Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \"questions for conversations,\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review) A fresh take on a classic The Penguin clothbound classics are all beautiful, but I like the Sense and Sensibility cover the very best. They make beautiful gifts and look great on the bookshelf. I looked everywhere and the price I paid on Amazon ($13.60) is by far the cheapest. They're a bargain at that price. Penguin clothbound classics The type was readable, illustrations interesting. Most of the pages were slightly misprinted in that a word(s) that belonged on the following pages were printed by themselves at the bottom of each page. No part of the text appeared to have been lost by this mistake.I did not find the comments, appendix useful. Sense & Sensibility hardback 01/03/07 This book is an excellent way to see how English society ran hundreds of years ago. The only issue that people will have with the book is that it is written in an older style of English which can be hard to follow. Excellent Book, for it's time I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection. A Readers Must! Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, who happens to be my favorite author. I don't think I need to incredible detail here since if you're thinking about reading it, you more than likely familiar with Ms. Austen's writing. I think I enjoy this one because Eleanor is such a sensible character, as is Anne Elliot (my favorite Austen heroine). I felt so much for her and enjoyed experiencing her sorrow and her happiness. An enjoyable story, great for those new to Austen This is, of course, a classic...and a must read. Take your time and enjoy. It helps to have a list of the characters so you can keep everyone straight. Jane Austen...what more can you say Awesome read! I only wish I had read it sooner. Enjoy one of the great classics. I Love Kindle books. Sense and Sensibility A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness. The Miss Dashwood sisters Many critics tell us that Austen's first novel, Sense and Sensibility, is not her best. So what? I don't compare Austen's books. I relish the gems they each contain in their own right. First and Splendid I really didn't enjoy Pride & Prejudice, so I didn't expect much from Sense & Sensibility. But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.And the DRAMA! My God! Did people during this time really act like this? With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments. We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts. People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility. It's insane! If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me. Fantastic! 19th Century Drama! I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book. That's because I dearly loved the movie \"Sense and Sensibility\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson. Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation. I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.But her style! Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.First, he wrote in \"Remembered Yesterdays\": \"Jane Austen? Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\"Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No -- there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\"I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen. I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen. I credit them with great patience and intelligence. I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task. Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness. There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done. If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then. If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category. I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot. But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death. Mark Twain was right, I'm afraid Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\"It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.Laurel Ann, Austenprose A passionate, relevant, and refreshing reading of an Austen classic by Stevenson Not as good as \"Pride and Prejudice\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant. Particularly good are those where Jane Austin applying her great satirical talent. I liked very much how she painted the character of John Dashwood: soft but very biting image of the selfish and greedy fellow. Balance of judgment and passion - dilemma as old as Seneca writing and beyond - revealed in this novel slightly in obsolete form, but essence is the same: you suffer more when submit to passions, but who can live by the rule of judgment only? Good reading but not excellent I have had the pleasure now of having read a great deal of Austen's works. She had a knack for depicting human nature in a very skillful and entertaining manner. My one regret in my reading of Austen is that I started with this book. This book is skillfully written, with lush language. My problem is that the ending is so surreal and sudden. I do recommend this book; but not for beginners. If you are only starting with Austen, read Persuasion or Emma first. Lush, yet cheapened by the ending. I gave this review 4 stars because at the end I get so disappointed, for I want so much more. However considering the era it's to be expected. Love reading Jane Austen Although this isn't my favorite, like Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice, it is still an enjoyable read. I feel that I can never go wrong with Jane Austen, one of my all-time favorite authors next to Virginia Frazier. You can't go wrong with Jane Austen I love the collectors edition of this book! It is beautifully crafted and stands out brightly. Jane austen transfers us from our current traditions to her English Utopia. Who wouldn't want to go?! I will read and re-read this book for the rest of my life and wish I could play the piano as accomplished marianne can or budget the household economy as aptly as Elinor and climb trees and lie atop of an atlas' as Margaretdoes dreaming of advebtures. Exceptional book.The Fifteen Houses: A Novel A must have for your collection! Juliet Stevenson is a great narrator she is able to give each of her characters a distinct voice and her intonations are perfect. She makes the emotions of the characters and the situations come alive. Great Narrator Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture. A classic Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing. Looks Good I'm a relative newcomer when it comes to Jane Austen; I didn't finish my first Austen until well into my twenties, and I'm still working my way through the set. \"Sense and Sensibility\" is my third of her novels, and I find myself loving the overall story but at the same time seeing where there are problems with the text.For those who are unaware, the story is about Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who are near-opposites of each other. Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \"Pride and Prejudice\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \"Sense and Sensibility\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, like some of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.\"Sense and Sensibility\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels. A Classic Jane Austen's books do not thrill me. The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading. Austen's work My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 8. Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up. Not my sort of novel or subject. Okay This novel may not by Austen's most famous, but it is certainly worth reading.In Sense and Sensibility, we are given several characters that appear to be static. You have the good and bad sister and they are destined to remain so for the rest of the story. But are they? I thought the way the so called \"bad\" sister changed her character by the end of the story was inspiring.The catch to this story is you have to read the whole thing in order to get to the good stuff at the end. Don't worry, it is time well spent. Redemption Perhaps one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It's perfect in every way! Sense and Sensibility I've seen both movie versions (US and BBC) and had to read the story in college for a class. That was how I was introduced to the story of Sense and Sensibility. I liked it originally and as time progressed, it has become one of my favorites. Great story and easy to follow the flow of the story. Classic Favorite \"Sense and Sensibility\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \"Pride and Prejudice\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \"Sense and Sensibility\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson. Spellbinding for my sense and sensibility. I tried very hard all through high school and college to be a Jane Austen fan. I could never get fully engrossed in one of her books and thus assumed that the writing style just didn't appeal to me. But once I tackled Sense and Sensibility, I found that Austen could engage me after all. I love Austen's structuring of this book--the contrast of the Dashwood women and the subtle caricatures presented in their surrounding families. And I thought the plot was plenty dramatic enough to carry me through to the final page. I finished it in three days. Austen late-comer. It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility. I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader. Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case. This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time. Those who have read S&S; know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate. The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time. Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain. Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon. Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak. Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago. Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her. I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu. I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor. He made his bed, after all. Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book. Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative. However, this novel is not perfect. There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout. I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about. But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends. What a wonderful treat! My third favorite Austen... revisited Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot. Slow but Steady This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies. But the elegant prose, twisting plot and amusing characters won me round. Austen, I belatedly discover, is one clever writer. A fine romance My 2nd favorite Austen novel after &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I bought it for my Kindle to enjoy over and over. Love Jane Austen Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann An Excellent Introduction to Jane Austen I adore Jane Austen in audio. I think I'd have trouble reading the actual books but when one is able to listen to someone read the book to you and let the words wash over you in that way it is fantastic. This is my 4th Austen book on audio and I highly recommend it to anyone else who is an Austen fan! Austen I was excited to receive a free copy of the Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition by Jane Austen($11 .99) from Bethany House! I love reading Jane Austen's works and wanted to see what benefits the Insight Edition could bring to the experience. What I found is Jane Austen's text is completely there but has been enhanced with notes, facts, and thoughts in the margins. These annotations fall in 7 categories, denoted by icons, as follows(taken directly from page 8):Historical and cultural details and definitions from England in the early 1800s. Icon - a crown.Facts and tidbits from Austen's life that parallel or illuminate the novel. Icon - a quill pen.References to S&S; in today's culture, particularly in film. Icon - a movie camera.Unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters. Icon - a frowning face.Themes of faith drawn from the novel or Austen's life. Icon - a cross.Comments and asides on the book's characters and plot. Icon - an open book.The parts of the novel that just make us smile. Icon - a smiley face.It really was a pleasure reading this book! I enjoyed having definitions, facts, and more right along side the pertinent parts of the book. This edition even has 12 questions for conversation at the end that could be used in a book club, if you are a part of one.{Disclaimer: I received one copy of this book for free to read and review from Bethany House. I received no other compensation and all opinions presented herein are my own.} Classic but better! Ihave always wanted to read Jane Austen but, to be honest, have always been rather intimidated. However, I have recently found two things that dramatically help put that intimidation aside- reading in an English accent (haha- seriously!) and using the Insight Editions of her work!If you haven't heard of the Insight Editions published by Bethany House, you have really got to check them out! All throughout the books they sprinkle little trivia and helpful side-notes. Everything from how things were depicted in film adaptations, to what was happening in Jane's real life at the time of her authorship, to giving the context and definition to various phrases and references in the books, the Insight Editions truly give that extra little verve and interest to the classic works. The extras are well written and added with care by a fellow author (Julie Klassen) who has a genuine love and appreciation for Austen's work.Now, of course, Jane Austen stands on her own just fine, but having always been an avid watcher of DVD Bonus Features, the Insight Edition was right up my alley! If you have ever considered purchasing one of these classics, I would highly recommend going the Insight Edition route! Like watching a DVD Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time. Critique of the wonderful Sense and Sensibility This is my second Kindle purchase of S&S. This one includes the classic illustrations (which look awesome in color on the Kindle ipad app). However, I usually read it on my Kindle 2. What I really like about this edition is the Kindle formatting. There are nice space breaks between paragraphs and everything wraps properly. It's a joy to read. I recommend it to all Kindle Janeites and anyone else who has never read S&S but wants to! Great Kindle formatting! Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California). Disappointing After Pride and Prejudice Jane Austen had such a great sense of humor. This book is so enjoyable on so many different levels. I am a light to moderate reader and this book had me entertained right away. I highly recommend it. What an enjoyable book English literature at it's best. This is a perfect e-reader or kindle version of any kind. Suggest reading this before any visual represenatation. If viewed, suggest the Emma Thompson version. She manages to capture all of the subtle emotional inferences on which eveything depends. So Fabulous At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma. However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters). Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable. S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters. A really great read--if you stick with it. Slow start, unpredictable finish When Girlebooks decided to publish a bicentenary edition of Sense and Sensibility, they were faced with the dilemma of how to make it \"different\". Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \"matchless match\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \"what's to come\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which would have been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \"Doctor\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\"Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \"Biography and Criticism\", \"Authors Having Fun with Jane\" and \"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\". There is also a complete list of Sense and Sensibility films--surely enough extended reading to satisfy even my enthusiasm for the subject!Sense and Sensibility, the Bicentenary edition is available in paperback, as well as Kindle/Mobipocket PRC, Adobe Reader PDF, Microsoft Reader LIT and Epub editions. Check out your favorite medium, today! All versions arrive with beautiful formatting and charming illustrations, making them instant favorites--easy to read and lovely to behold.

         "Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition",
         "Very useful information, but like many books bogs down a little on the back end. Other than that, the book practices what it preaches. I've given my copy to our web design team and plan to see it passed around. Good, but the last part made me think Krug gives a great deal of information on how a site needs to be designed for better usability. I think most people do have a sense of using the web, as a result I found some of the topics mentioned in the book to be extremely basic and naive, but are none-the-less important points and count for improving usability.The authors' study on web usability is highly commendable and the book itself is a very good read.\"The Back button is the most-used feature of Web browsers.\" many inner details This is the one book that will immediately make you understand that the IT wizards and content managers have separate and distinct jobs. Please, don't spend multi-bucks on another monument to Internet Technology without absorbing, understanding and applying usability testing before releasing another \"stinky\" web site that no one will look at twice. Don't Create Another Web Site Without this Book Dear Mr. Krug,Thank you for writing such a user-friendly book. It was assigned reading for a Masters program in Instructional Technology in which I'm enrolled. The book stands out like an island of rest in a sea of confusion.You could have written a book with a lot of filler, and gone on and on as if no one was listening. But instead you wrote in a way that makes it seems like your talking directly to me.And in an environment where most everyone else seems to be just throwing up a verbal smoke screen, being addressed personally has been very affirming. The result is that you've encouraged me to be a Mensch in my own work, even when I'm \"sure\" there will be no direct payback.When I treat people with respect, I find a new world opens up before me.Drew Thank you, Mr. Krug! Great examples, relevant concepts, all and all a great book. I wish the examples were a little more up to date. Short and Sweet This is an excellent resource - crystal clear and quite understandable. Practical in providing \"best practices\" that you can actually DO - quickly and with little or no additional resources. Average Web Designers? You've found your bible! An easy to follow and easy to understand book for those focused on web usability. Although Krug could go in to deeper information in many areas he does a good job of highlighting the most important aspects of usability while letting the reader conduct a deeper investigation on their own. A good reference for those wanting quick and useful insights to web usability. Worth the investment This really is a beautiful book. It does a wonderful job of following its own principles. Not only is it clear and simple, but also very effective. Many of the examples are really out of date, but the ideas that they illustrate continue to be evident throughout websites.If you desire to learn more about simple web usability, this book is a must-read. Web Usability at its simplest I'm really happy I bought this book - it delivered much more than I expected. This book came highly recommended from several sources. I'm a novice designing the first web site for my business, using Wordpress - tried some designers and decided I needed to be able to experiment with look and content - designers were pretty rigid. This book covers a comprehensive set of topics related to how visitors use the site. It's very practical, easy to read, gives picture examples of \"good\" and \"not good\", gives guidelines that are easy for me to understand. It is simplifying the process for me and moving me several design iterations ahead of where I was before I got the book. It also gives me a good base of knowledge so I can benchmak other sides and so I could work more effectively with a designer in the future. Don't Make Me Think I don't know why this 200 page book receives such great reviews.The quality of writing is nothing to be marvelled at, somewhere around grade 3. The advice is O.K., but after the first 20 pages it feels like this seemingly short and condensed book is dragging on and on.The chapter on testing is so-so. However it could have been accomplished in 1/3 the space, without the silly examples.The chapter on usability is way outdated and the present browser zooming makes some of the concepts obsolete. Some advice is useful, but it's buried in words.From the usability perspective, this book on usability is not very \"usable\". The author tries to be funny (and sometimes succeeds) instead of conveying key-points. There are no main concepts or anything that you can take away from some parts of the book, except for a strange chapter titles like \"Don't throw the baby out with the dishes\" (which I think are meant to be funny).For a much better coverage of the importance of testing and rapid prototyping I would actually recommend \"The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses\". The book is not really about web-design, but it conveys the need for some of the things that \"Don't make me think\" glosses over in a much greater depth. The writing and jokes are also far superior to that of Steve Krug.For the programmers, CC2 should scratch all the right places to get the curious about the right things. I know it's a \"bit\" bigger but you would be a poor programmer if you did not read it anyway.For designers, a course/book in/on design/typography should be much more useful allocation of their time.My \"test\" of this book determined the following low hanging fruit:-Low level of writing-Too much wordiness-Not enough key-points/solid ideasIn the end I think this is an ok average book, for an average sit-at-home web-designer which will maybe improve your web-site. Sadly it does not leave you with any desire to pursue the subject, and you are left with a few \"band-aid\" solutions and no reasonable foundation or ideas of your own. Hugely overrated and not very insightful Dealing with web designers and company owners can be a real problem because of their warped view of what creating a webpage means. Being an IT consultant, many of the purely technical arguments become nonsense to them, whereas debunking theirs becomes counterproductive. This book can be read by anyone who's involved in web design and deployment, to get a feel of the real issues faced by the end user, in a clear and practical way.I particularly like the self-assessment examples: they baffle designers and CEOs by showing how wrong are the models that they typically come up with, but also explain how to fix that and change their mindset. I also love the sample e-mails intended to persuade designers and CEOs on their bad ideas (\"Help! My boss wants me to...\"). A summary of common sense for web designers read this book in about 2 hours. no chatter, just meat. lots of illustrations to help you visualize and practical tips that you can easily implement. easy + practical Because I am from Brazil, I had to wait two months to start read that book and I have to say: this book is worthy of each waiting day.The \"rules\", the tips and all experience shared on this book is a content that every single people who works on web needs to try. That's simply incredible! Thank you Mr. Krug. Surprising Excellent book. Well thought out by a man clearly very knowledgeable in the field of web design usability. It was an easy read and very intelligently and clearly presented. Couldn't be better! Dont Make me Think Steve Krug gives a simple explanation of website useability. Don't Make Me Think is a very easy quick read everyone with anything to do with website design or online businesses should read. A Must Read The book provides a clear and simple description of how to design web sites so they will be usable. Great introduction to web usability principles I bought this book to help me with a project at work. I'm not an IT person but have somehow managed to get involved in an IT development project that requires me to focus on the user experience for a new system we're developing. We all know - on some level - what annoys us when we're searching the internet, but we don't always know why it's annoying. Or we don't always recognise why some sites are almost a pleasure to browse. This book has helped me understand some of the fundamental, common sense practices that make the difference between a good browsing experience and an annoying (or downright bad) one. It's an easy read that uses practical screen samples to demonstrate what it's saying. I've found it very useful and it has definitely made me look at my project in a different way. Common sense is obvious - so why do we miss it so often? I would recommend this product to anyone choosing a projector and wants lots of brightness. This lamp provides a very bright image on the screen. Relpacement of Projector lamp As the introductory matter suggests, this book can be read in a couple of hours. It's worth taking the time. It gives some very useful, simple guidelines to designing a good user interface and eliminating the interminable arguments that come down to matters of taste. The good and bad examples are illuminating and make the book fun to read. Concise, easy read, good ideas From the school of minimalism, Steve Krug goes through point by point the smaller (and larger) touches that can turn a website into either an annoyance or exactly what the user is looking for. While the examples in this edition are slightly outdated, the information remains. Similarly, it remains broadly applicable to other aspects of design, such as software or complex system user interfaces.I found this in certain fundamental ways to be quite basic, in that he doesn't expound on practical limitations of large site development. But by the same token, its reductionist charm left me feeling like I really could implement simplified site mechanics while solidly reaching one of many targeted userbases.Highly recommended. Very good, basic usability book Good book, fast shipping Don't Make Me Think : A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability This is a lot older than I originally thought it was, it makes me reluctant to use it says it was published in 2006 in the book, but 2005 on the amazon website. Make sure you look at the dates because the internet was wildly changed from 2005-2006. It was probably good for that time, but times have changed. This is old A simple and direct book, with much fun and excellent examples, prominence for the illustrations of the book that speak by itself. The author was very happy in the approach, isn't a book for consultations, is a book to read one or two times to understand the message and apply in all of your projects.Is an excellent book, of fast and easy reading. Moreover, the author places all of points with great knowledge of cause and demonstrates that the obvious not always is so obvious.An excellent introduction to usability in web, shows how to realize usability tests and how to deal with situations where you is forced to make what you knows that's wrong. Nice approach Dont make me think - makes me think. I am enjoying it so far. Excited to use some of these ideas in development. Dont make me think... Great, common sense look at how to correct all the stupid things we do to mess up our websites. Why didn't I think of that? The author definitely practices what he preaches by keeping the book short, to the point and very enjoyable to read. I did not read the first edition, but this book was a great! I would have loved to have seen more real-situation examples, but otherwise well worth my money and a must have for all web designers. Great Read! Don't Make Me Think is easy to read, but loaded with practical information about website design - organization, display, navigation, user-testing, etc. High quality, full-color illustrations, too. Well done. Thanks for the extra efforts in writing and publishing. Don't Make Me Think This book is a very useful introductory text on usability. On scanning (no pun intended - the author has a chapter on how web users scan) the book I discovered it has valuable insight into almost all day to day issues we have designing sites which work. It helps you with a reality check on your site. You may not find solutions to your usability problems, but what you will find are suggestions and approaches to find a solution which works. The language and flow are really simple and that's what I liked most of this book. Covers 80% of the cases I had to read this book in a college course a few years ago and it was somewhat outdated then. I bought this book for my wife and she agrees with me that it's a quality book to read once since it teaches usability basics, but don't expect to find the newest and greatest UI/UX information in this publication. Good book to read once This should be compulsory reading for anyone who has anything to do with producing web sites. Common sense, concise, clever and clear advice. Should be compulsory Everyone who is involved in making websites (executives, designers, technicians), should read this book about the main usability topics. Very well written! Great book Krug breaks the issues of usable web design into simple, digestible form for anyone who depends on a website for promotion or income. Simply put, if it isn't usable, people won't use it, and they will go elsewhere with their money. He explains the need for and the process to do web testing so that the web site can fit itself to the needs of its particular audience, not some generic \"user.\"Designers who earned their chops in TV or print should read this book to see how the internet is a different animal, and how internet visitors have different needs than magazine/newspaper readers or TV watchers. Ignoring those differences will have an effect on the bottom line. Don't think about it. Get this book. Thinking about Web Design Stop. Before you publish that next website, read this book. It's a quick read, only a few hours, but it'll save you days or weeks of headaches later on. It's way too easy to stop thinking as a user when you're designing a website, and Steve Krug's book kicks you right back into a user's point of view and explains how and why you should stay there when designing. Usability made easy This is an excellent book on web site usability. It's a very easy read with great supporting images. It's actually pretty entertaining in the way it's written & holds your attention. It's not your usual boring industry-read. Entertaining & Informative This made me very happy to buy my college books at the lower cost of 66%. It is a must have if in college and take the course A must have All in all, while there doesn't seem to be a ton of NEW information for web designers that have been in the field for a few years or more, Steve does a fantastic job of taking all of the bits of knowledge and tying them together in a cohesive, easily understandable structure, shedding new light and insight along the way. That's not to say there is NO new information. Everyone will find something in here that they didn't know before. More importantly, however, are Steve's perspectives into really making what you already know work for you.The book does a great job of breaking down the web design process in an easy to digest step-by-step process, calling out challenges, obstacles, and no-brainers along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed having lots of what I'd picked up over the years brought into focus and examined through new filters.The one thing that I wish this book had is a detachable checklist. Or one that you can download and print from his website, http://sensible.com/. Now that the entire process is broken down and defined, it would have been nice to have a quick-reference checklist for practical use a day-to-day operations. Ties it all together I suppose it makes sense that a book on ease-of-use would be really easy to use. I wasn't too excited about reading this book, because I thought it would be too dry and instructional. I was pleasantly surprised to find it interesting and readable, even for people who don't work on websites every day. Very readable I've been working in the web industry for over 5 years now, and pretty much thought I had it all figured out, as far as usability is concerned.Wow, was I wrong. Reading Krug's book opened up my eyes to several important aspects of web usability that I had overlooked. I especially found the section on user testing useful.This is one of the best investments you can make for your career! An absolute must-read for web professionals Most technology and design books tend to be bloated, academic snoozers.Not this one.If you have anything to do with designing web sites and applications, buy this book for yourself and every member of your team. You will never, ever regret it. The most usable book ever The book only took about 3 hours to read, however, there was a lot of good information. I liked the conversational style of writing, and found that the book did a great job of hitting the major points of usability/UX Design. No real earth shattering concepts for those who are current professionals in the User Centered Design field, but could be very helpful for those who are not. Long story short, this book is worth your time, and it is also a good book for a short trip. Quick read, but lot of good information Do I like the book?Yes, an easy to read and simple book with easy to learn methods.Do I recommend you to read this book?Yes, if you are a beginner in web usability looking to start your career or you are just interested in the subject in general and want to take a quick look then this book is perfect for you.The book sets you in track then offers a list of other great books to read so you can continue your journey.A thank you to author.

         "The main character is Jim and the book is about how all the pirates on the ship are trying to get to treasure island. I think that the auther did a very good job with describing the characters and places in the book. I also think that the auther was not very descriptive when he was talking about things. At times the plot was very confusing. In the book the sentence structuse I think sometimes was very pourly done. I think that because the sentences went on and on but the pharagragh was vey fine sizes.Sometimes the book is very hillarias. Over all the this book was pretty good. I would not recommend this book to younger aged kids because the book uses a couple curse words and some of the words are kind of challenging. When you read the story it keeps you interested, yet it is a good sized book. I think that this book is really interesting because it will keep you thinking the entire time and it relates to other sea books. Treasure Island review After having watched many movie adaptations and of course the cartoon adaptations I grew up with I'm glad I took the time to read the book. Will I read it again? Certainly! I love the deeper intricacies of story that are often omitted from the movies. My only quarrel is I prefer the movie adaptations over the books representation of John Silver. The book had him more dark while movies had him little more likeable. He's just one of those bad guys you just have to like no matter the case I reckon. So the movies played a bit more on that. But definitely worth my time! I recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure.\"Pieces of Eight! Pieces of Eight!\" The famous tale of swashbuckling pirates and buried treasure! GREAT BOOK, A CLASSIC!!! Good read for all ages!!! Even if you've read it before GET this and read it again, this takes you to Treasure Island all that's missing is the smell of salt water Treasure Island First read this book over 50 years ago. It was more interesting this time and worth the time to revisit. Just watched the movie on Netflix and couldn't help comparing the two. Great to read this classic A classic pirate tale bested by no other. All recent tales of piracy got their start in the imagination of Stevenson. Excellent book! Hellow fellow readers. I am Caleb. I`m 11 years old and I love this book! B ut do you know what`s better? THE ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!! My Nana has the original book and it`s sighed! The original has a few alterations but it`s just as good. I Hope Amazon have or are reading this because the original is so much better, so changing it will most likely sell better than this one. Original Our school was trying to match an existing set of Treasure Island books.These books were exactly what we wanted, and following our order, we received them very quickly. Exactly what we wanted. i read 5 pages and i did not under stand 1 wordi hated every single word and thing in the book! worst book ever! The book was interesting and an adventure. Written very well and took me back to my childhood. Rated 5 stars Treasure Island I read while my grandson followed in his copy of this great book. The illustrations are great and the print is large. revisit Treasure Isle with grandson. In my retirement I have decided to revisit titles from my youth. No disappointment in Treasure Island. A &#34;treasure&#34; in itself. A classic re-visited dont read this story it is a pain. But I recomend the movie so dont ever read. this book totally bites! TREASURE ISLAND was first published in 1883 by Cassell & Company, Limited, London, England. Has probably never been out of print since, though first published as a serial in a boy's magazine, it has become a book for almost everyone.Some editions of the book have a map included, others do not. My 1965 edition of Signet Classics does not, but my later Signet edition does. Some readers find the map interesting and helpful, others such as LORD OF THE FLIES author, William Golding, referred to the map, as only an \"overrated chart\". When reading introductions or afterwords in the various editions of TREASURE ISLAND one can find almost anything, from praise or lack of praise where Robert Louis Stevenson is concerned. Since I know little of his Scottish background or Calvinism or much of anything else of the man, I find TREASURE ISLAND only a very fine book and am not surprised at all that, though it began its life as somewhat a failure as a magazine serial, it has become a lasting classic.Even should one not have read the book, characters such as Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins, Blind Pew, Black Dog or Billy Bones and various other terms such as pieces of eight, or black spot, are familiar terms in and of themselves. Though some reviewers say the characters are only two dimensional, RLS certainly put enough of them in the book. There are more than enough black hearted pirates to go 'round, and in the character of Long John Silver Stevenson struck pure gold. So much in fact that his original title for TREASURE ISLAND almost was 'The Sea Cook' based on the part ole 'barbecue' (Long John Silver) has aboard the Hispaniola. Yes, Silver is a character well worth his salt, starting out somewhat good, becoming bad, and then morphing back into somewhat good, a character to remain long after the reading. And he escapes the gibbet in the end, not an easy feat in England at that time. Before reading the book I had felt it to be an 'Englishman's' book of England of sorts, yet nothing is farther from the truth, as Robert Louis Stevenson was very much a man of Scotland and the book becomes more of a Scotman's view of the English. Interesting indeed with some subtle truths and asides if one recognizes them.Stevenson started with only the map, one he had drawn for his young stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, yet this map gave birth to the novel. Stevenson's father gave idea to Billy Bone's trunk and its contents, going so far as picking the name Walrus for evil Captain Flint's old ship. From stepson Lloyd we also get the structure and stricture that there be no girls in this book, only male sailors and pirates. Lloyd wanted a boy's book of treasure and pirates. Fortunately girl readers have had as much enjoyment as the boys down through the years.If a reader enjoys a return to their youth of pirate ships, pirates, and an island of treasure to the amount of 700,000, then get on board the Hispaniola and ride with this group to Treasure Island.Semper Fi. PIECES OF EIGHT, PIECES OF EIGHT, FOLLOW THE RED X ON THE MAP Awesome! I've known about this book for many of my 60 years but never got around to reading it. Makes me want to read more of the classics! Wonderful classic! Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is by far one of the best adventure stories I have ever read. This book deserves all five stars, it has everything you could ask for such as, suspense, comedy, action, drama and a great plot line. R.L. Stevenson puts a lot of detail into his main characters such as Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins just to name a few. He describes the scenes with such great detail that at times I had to remind myself that it is only a book. I spent more than 2 months reading this book and I enjoyed every part of it. I could RARELY find a paragraph that was dull, the book was very exciting overall. This book is fairly easy to read and I would recommend it to adults and children of all ages. The book moves at a very good pace, not too fast, not too slow. This book is anything but boring, something new happens in every chapter for instance, when Jim witnesses a murder and when he gets into bar fights, those are just some of the many things that happened. I was very surprised myself when I read this book because it seems a little childish but in fact it's quite the contrary. I highly recommend that you go out and read this book! Real World Writing My quest through the free Kindle classics continued with Treasure Island.Having never read this book it was all new to me.I found it was very well written as it kept me roped in to the story from start to finish and was perfectly formatted for the kindle.This book should be required reading in school! If you are looking for a good fun read for all ages this book should be on your list. A Great Tale Them that die'll be the lucky ones.-Treasure IslandThe last few pirate movies (Hook and Cutthroat Island among them) have bombed so disastrously atthe box office that it's hard to tell whether it was simply because they weren't very good or whetherkids have abandoned the genre. I certainly hope it's the former, I'd hate to think that kids today aremissing out on all the great pirate tales that we used to thrill too. Foremost of these was, of course,Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.I may well be wrong here, but it seems to me that Stevenson pioneered one of the central techniques ofchildren's literature ; placing a child at the center of what might otherwise be a typical adult adventurenovel. This simple but ingenious idea gives kids a character to identify with and allows the author towrite from the child's perspective.In the case of Treasure Island, young Jim Hawkins narrates the story of how he and Squire Trelawney,Dr. Livesey, and the enigmatic Long John Silver ended up on board the Hispaniola, looking for thelost treasure of the notorious pirate Captain John Flint. Packed with betrayals, battles, mutinies, andeven a parrot squawking &quot;Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!&quot;, the book is the source for many of theenduring and beloved clich&eacute;s of the genre.This is a classic that each generation should discover anew. Heck, if enough kids start reading it again,maybe Hollywood will even take another crack at a pirate movie, this time a decent one.GRADE : A+ rediscover a classic The book Treasure Island is an exciting book. It contains mutineers, pirates, and a big treasure. It is a challenging book to read though. There are loops and turns around every corner. Jim, the main character comes across a ship called the Hispaniola, and rode it for the rest of the book. He takes on many troubles throughout the book. At first, he meets a man called Long John Silver. He seems very nice at first but at the end, he finds out something about Silver.There tends to be mutinies when a ship sets off for treasure, and that's exactly what happens.One day, the ship is sailing on and BOOM! There sounds a gunshot! The wicked mutineers attack the ship killing one person, shooting them in the head. But it's not over yet! Three muskets go off at a time and one of the mutineers falls. The fight goes on and it is soon found out that the mutineers had lost more souls then the ships company and that was good for Jim.At one point in the book, Jim comes across a man that was on an island that had been marooned and he had been there for over three years and had to live off eating goat.The sentence structure of the book was a very hard. The sentences were very hard to read and there were a lot of things going on at the same time and it never seemed to end. One reason that the book was so hard was it was almost a different kind of English. The book was written in the late 1800 so it was very hard to understand. The sentences were long and choppy and they went on. But on the other hand some sentences were only two words.The word choice of the book was two ways mostly. That means that some words were long and some words were very short. But the words were switched around so it was even harder to read.The description of the book was not so great. Robert didn't describe the setting too well. Sometimes you couldn't tell where Jim was at some points because of the poor description.My opinion of the book was not so great and it was hard to understand because of the word choice and the settings were very bad at some points. At one part of the book Jim comes off the ship and it doesn't explain what was happening and it seemed there was something missing. And at some points it seemed that the word were too long and you were waiting for something else to happen and it got boring. After some sentences it was so confusing that you had to read it again until you got what was going on. That was hard to do and that's one reason I didn't like the book all that much.I think that the appropriate age for reading this book is about 13 or 14 yeas old. I think that it was not so good for my age because I didn't understand it all that much, and if someone were older, then they have a better learning experience and they can understand the hard words. I am only eleven years old and this book is not such a good book for my age.Ben Schwartz 6th Grade TREASURE ISLAND is GOOD The book Treasure Island is an adventure book, and for good reasons. This action packed story takes place hundreds of years ago and the setting goes from a dangerous home, to the sea, and finally to an island. In the story Jim Hawkins finds a treasure map and he says in the book that he will try to get the treasure. The main characters are Jim Hawkins, the young lad pursuing treasure, Long John Silver, the experienced sailor who is the cook, and one of the bad guys blind Pew. This is a book that kids would like but is probably recommended for older people due to its reading difficulty. The sailors and Jim Hawkins try to find an island with buried treasure but first they must overcome many treacherous obstacles. The reason this book blows away the competition is because you will always wonder what will happen on the open seas were rules hardly apply. I cannot be sure of the way sailors used to talk but from what I know the author rights it exactly as it would have been said. The reviewers say, \"masterfully crafted\" which is only one of many phrases that can portray the excellence of the book. You have to read this slowly, page by page because it has a lot of information on each page and if you read it to quickly you won't understand what just happened. This is not a book you can read right before bed because it's hard to put it down and you might end up reading all night. This book is like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter because people are out to kill you and this book shows many scenes were the characters make narrow escapes, but sometimes they don't. When you read this book you wonder is like a mix of fiction, non- fiction, and science fiction because the adventures are so detailed you might think you are there but it has many surprising scenes that you wonder if that could happen. Although the author has a slow pace it shows every last repetitive thing you have to do at sea. The author also is good at making it feel real, like you are really there. In away this book is like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate where at the very beginning the characters are pretty happy but then someone comes and ruins it then that person keeps going at the people for the money that is rightfully theirs. Basically what I have been saying about Treasure Island is that you should read it.-Kyle Watson Treasure Island Treasure Island is a good book. The story is interesitng but can get confusing. There are so many twists in the story you never know what is going to happen. If you like adventure you would love this book. treasure island My son listened to this audio book as he read along.It made the accents and old time literature easier to understand. homework help This audio program was excellent. The characterizations were wonderful. The characters came alive and made the listener feel like he/she was really getting to know them. In this day of poor TV programing, listening to this great old story on CD was an excellent entertainment and a great way to relive this wonderful ageless story. Treasure Island A classic. Written in the old English and seafaring slang made it a little difficult to read but enough to understand. Treasure Island Treasure Island is without doubt one of the masterpieces of world literature. It's enduring appeal to generations of adventure loving boys (big and small) is sufficient proof. I have read this book many times including even in Latin (yes, there is such an edition:Insula Thesauraria (Latin Edition)) and still find it an exciting read. After all, what could be more appealing than a tale of vicious pirates, a fabulous treasure and a journey into the unkown across exotic seas? Another exciting book isThe Drum, equally suitable for young readers by AEW Mason. Masterpiece Very vivid imagination. Truly love old English writing. Would recommend to anyone. Felt privileged to have read this literary classic. a true classic Before Capt. Jack Sparrow there was Long John Silver. If you love adventure stories with pirates and buried treasure you will love this book. RLS provides a riveting tale told from the perspective of a young boy. I had never read anything from Stevenson before, but from the start of this book I was hooked. A must read for pirate fans I bought this book as a classic for my grandson. It is a beautiful book but I had forgotten how scary it is. The characters are wonderfully drawn and the illustrations by Wyeth are lovely. I will have to keep until my grandson is about 12 as I do think that would be the right age for a child to read it. As an adult, I enjoyed Stevenson's language and story! Recalling Treasure Island Excellent. I haven't read this book since school many years ago and I love it. I hope that everyone enjoys also. Treasure Island While Treasure Island may have its detractors (usually those who were forced to read it as children or those who cannot handle the period speech) it is certainly a classic that can delight both young and old. Stevenson make a strong effort to catch the \"tune of the time\" and give vivid prose to the tedium of long sea journeys and the rapid pace at which life can offer strange events to deal with, as young Jim Hawkins discovers.The story is set in mid-18th century western England where Jim helps to run a small out-of-the-way inn with his parents. They have a strange boarder: a grizzled sailor very fond of his shanties and rum. The sailor hides a secret map to a buried pirate treasure that comes into Jim's hands. The local squire recruits Jim and the village doctor to join him on a sea voyage to find the treasure for themselves.They obtain a ship and a crew including the most iconic pirate of all: Long John Silver (created well before the seafood restaurant and Jack Sparrow!). Silver eventually betrays Jim, revealing himself as a longtime pirate, but makes good his escape in the end. Stevenson filled Treasure island with all of the--now cliche--paraphenalia: marooning, parrots, and such. The pirates have enough colorful language that even Robert Newton must have tired of it during his enthusiastic performance in the 1950 Disney film adaptation.Perhaps my fondness is newfound since I only read it for the first time this year while I was on a week's cruise in the Caribbean, but Treasure Island now holds a favored spot on my bookshelves. Classic that should be mandatory reading I enjoyed the the plot unfolded in this story. I also enjoyed the characters personalities and attitudes when trying to find the treasure Good story \"Treasure Island\" is a great story that I've read a few times - a well-written, fun adventure, with clear descriptions and characterisation, and characters you can side with. It has one or two racist comments, similar to the novel \"King Solomon's Mines\", but if you can overlook that it is an enjoyable read. Fast-paced fun Originally written for Stevenson's young American stepson, TREASURE ISLAND is a lighter read and less mature than his other works. Still, it is a highly entertaining, fast-paced novel that certainly deserves its status as a classic in English literature. Being perhaps the most influential book on the pirate mythos, this is one that you'll find familiar even if you've never read it before. From the one-legged Long John Silver and his motley band of scoundrels to treasure maps where 'X' marks the spot, this is the book that helped shape 'gentlemen of fortune' in many books and stories since then.Jim Hawkins, the young hero of the story, is the principle narrator, telling the story of his adventure in a rather breathless manner. Sometimes obscure details are described while traumatic scenes are sort of glossed over. In this way, the story really takes on a realistic feel, as Jim tells his story the way he remembers it. Unquestionably brave, Jim doesn't gloat on his accomplishments and victories, but relates the story in a modest way, hardly hesitating to describe his fear and admit his weaknesses.The other characters really drive the story. Long John Silver and all the pirates are some of the most colorful characters you'll ever find. Rough, deceitful, and hard, their motivations are never difficult to discern. Their sometimes hilarious manner of speaking displays their character and brings them to life like no amount of purely descriptive writing could. Jim Hawkins' friends are much less interesting as characters, but are nonetheless important. The squire, the doctor, and their men play key parts in the tale but are never really the focus of readers' attention. To be honest, compared to the other characters, they are rather dull.Robert Louis Stevenson's first published work is highly entertaining, but somewhat less mature than his other work. Meet Long John Silver in this classic tale of pirates! When first published this was considered an exciting story of English pirates. Today it reads as an interesting insight into old English culture and an interesting sea tale. Worth the read if you are interested in fictional history Treasure Island A timeless classic. Started to read it 50 or so years ago. Now reading it again and enjoying it as much as i did when I was a kid. Treasure Island Treasure Island, first published in book form in 1883, is THE pirate story. Many of the things we think of today as being trademarks of pirates (buried treasure, treasure maps, peg legs, parrots, desert islands) come more from Stevenson's tale than from history. But this book isn't about history, it's about pirates, adventure, and coming of age, and it delivers marvelously on all of those promises.The narrator, young Jim Hawkins, lives and works at an inn owned by his parents. One day, a mysterious seaman takes lodging there with an equally mysterious chest. After some time, other sailors arrive looking for the first seaman. Out of this, from the seaman's chest Jim manages to find a treasure map leading to the untold riches of a now-dead but still famous pirate named Captain Flint. Jim takes the map to a couple of country gentlemen, who decide to charter a ship to look for the treasure and take Jim along as cabin boy.Unfortunately for Jim and our heroes, but fortunately for the plot, they have a hard time finding sailors, and they turn to their new ship's cook, the one-legged Long John Silver, for \"help\" in rounding out the crew. Silver, as is hardly a spoiler, is actually a former pirate and crews the ship accordingly, having heard what they're after and eager to find those riches for himself.The excitement mounts as Jim goes on several daring adventures to save himself and the faithful party, and Silver struggles to keep control of his mutineers, all the while treasure is calling. Jim shows a great deal of growth, taking charge of several perilous situations and demonstrating considerable bravery he never possessed when dealing with the mysterious sailor in his parents' inn. Silver, meanwhile, is a savvy character who's self-interest and ability to play both sides against the middle knows no bounds. If you're looking for a master of duplicity and double-cross, Silver could give Jack Sparrow lessons.Stevenson's writing is fantastic. The colorful language of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience. The drama steadily rises, despite the fact the book's story is well known and I've read it several times before. It's certainly no accident that this book has had such a powerful effect on an entire genre of fiction even 130 years later.I've also listened to the book as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to on several other stories. If you're considering which audio version to listen to, you can't go wrong with Cosham's.Treasure Island is about as easily available as a book can be, as every library will have it on hand, it's on Wikisource for free, Amazon has it for Kindle for free or in paperback for $2, and I've even seen it at Target for $1. It's also only 300 quick pages. Seriously, there is no excuse for not reading this book. An absolute classic, and simply THE pirate story I love reading classics and this up there as one of the best ones. Jim Hawkins was described well, as well as other characters, but once I started reading it was hars to stop and I think many different people woud like this exciting tale!!!!!!!!:) Such an adventure! Great to read this one - prolly would never hav bought I so getting on the free list at kindle was a great find A good read This book was picked out as a birthday gift by a teenager colletor of barnes and noble classic books. Book was brought as a Birthday Gift !!! My daughter needs this book for the up coming school year. It is in great shape and arrive very quick. Quick Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone. Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum! I sure hope that kids, and adults too, are still out there reading this book. What an amazing gift to English literature. I can still see in my mind the worn hardback copy of Treasure Island at my hometown library. This is the one book that I can remember reading two or three times over when I was a kid. I recently read it again to my own kids, and delighted in the masterful storytelling and drama of the book. The story is complex but well-known: Jim Hawkins, the resourceful son of an infirm innkeeper, finds himself the possesser of a pirate's treasure map. The benevolent greed that grips the town's merchants who want to exploit the map eventually leads to the malicious greed of a band of murderous and mutinous pirates led by the cunning and deceitful Long John Silver (who would enjoy a second career as a fried fish pitchman). The single-minded pursuit of GOLD leads all of these men to face the sea, disease, and privation, and to kill each other. The story ends well enough from our protagonist's point of view, but it all seems quite \"realistic\" and gritty. Don't pass this one over - a classic, richly told and written well, that deserves a place in your canon. A Treasure I remember attempting Treasure Island as a young boy and thinking it boring. Clearly I was an undisciplined lout and did not give Stevenson's writing style a chance to take hold. Plow through the first 30 pages and you'll be hooked.This is an exciting adventure story for all-ages (there is a bit of violence but I suspect your boy will not be permanently scarred). Stevenson does an excellent job of catching the reader's imagination and first pulling then propelling him through the many adventures of young Jim Hawkins. It is a quick read and I assure you that you will not miss the evening or two of television viewing sacrificed. Excellent Adventure. Look for another copy. This one has a typo on the FIRST page. \"...keeping nothing back but the beaings [sic] of the island...\" Typo on the first page? Really? This is the first complete novel that I ever read as a child. Years later when I was traveling around America with my wife and concocting my first book \"Hobo-ing America\",Hobo-Ing America: A Workingman's Tour Of The U.S.A.I read this book aloud to my wife before turning out the camper lights every evening.For many years I could only imagine that Robert Louis Stevenson had grown up to be a pirate. How else could he have known the pirates ways so intimately? When I read a biography of Mr. Stevenson and found that he was a sickly child who was often confined to his room for long periods and had thought this whole business up in his vivid imagination, I was more than impressed. I was astounded. As a writer I have always found this fact inspirational.Long John Silver is now folklore like Paul Bunyan and John Henry. And Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the greatest writers ever.Can you believe that the same man who created Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hide also concocted Treasure Island. Wow!Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:Just Hangin' Out, Ma - Humorous Anecdotes - Lawrence, MA The Hobo Philosopher This is a awesome book. I like the fast pace of the story. This book is so great that I had a hard time putting it down, so I finished it in a bout one day. I think that this book is way better than the Pirates of the Caribbean series. A great book. An old classic I read many years ago. I found it to be very likable and entertaining even with some of the &#34;Pirate&#34; lingo being hard to understand at times Treasure Island I never read this book as a kid, and I don't even remember seeing the movie. I have a whole new view on eating at Long John Silvers now!I thought it was an enjoyable story, albeit a bit far-fetched that young Jim was so capable, and that Long John could get around so well on a crutch. Despite that, it was a fun read, and one I will recommend to my kids. Fun story - I missed out by not reading as a kid good book always like fun reading and that keeps you interested.would say that most people would enjoy this book. treasure island R. Ingpen is a wonderful illustrator, whose images are a tribute to an amazing story. The entire production, from illustrations, to paper, to font create a reading experience that is a credit to the work of R. L. Stevenson. This is a book that I have enjoyed reading and giving as a gift. A grand tribute to a grand adventure The story of Treasure Island takes place during the glorious 18th century, when seamen still sailed the oceans in search of wealth and fame. The most feared enemies were the sea pirates. Young Jim Hawkins discovers a treasure map in the sea-chest of the murdered pirate, Billy Bones. Jim joins Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney to form a partnership to search for buried pirate treasure. The presiding genius of their crew is the one-legged pirate turned sea cook, Long John Silver. Long John is cunning and bloodthirsty, without a shred of conscience. But his buoyant humour and vitality are irresistible. Their sea voyage turns out to become quite perilous when the first rumours of mutiny are being whispered on board of the Hispaniola.The point about classics such as Treasure Island is that you cannot doubt the relevance of such a book, since it is still popular more than 120 years after it was first published (1883). Hundreds of books following Treasure Island have used the image of the pirate Long John Silver and made it a universal type. Ask anyone to picture a pirate and in nine out of ten cases you will get something closely resembling Long John.The strongest quality of Treasure Island is that it is still surprisingly fresh. It has a pace that can stand comparison with any contemporary novel. Stevenson did not add a lot of moralising to the story, which is quite remarkable for a coming of age story dated from that period. The character of Long John suffers clearly from a certain machiavellian duality, a topic that will return more prominently in Stevenson's later work: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Still fresh and kicking always wanted to read this book but never seemed to have the time now i have kindle time is no problem great The book Treasure Island was a very thought out story, which had very effective characters. The names of the characters brought out the story, such as Long John Silver, he had a wooden leg and he was very tall. The author also made me very impatient, because at the beginning I knew that this was going to be a story about a treasure hunt, but I had to read a lot to get to that point. The setting was very evenly set out, like the author talked about the captain in the day, and Long John the mean person in the night. The author made the book exiting by not making the characters sail to the island, then find the treasure, and come home. He made it interesting, while they were sailing, and when the reached the island. The best part of the story I liked was when Jim a young boy, is of to take a tour of the island by himself when he hears shuffling in the bushes, this happens until Jim looks behind the bushes to find his old friend who has been stranded on the island for many years. Situations like that is what made the book Treasure Island a very exiting, adventurous, and enjoyable book to read. Amazing - A true Wonder This book is great. It is not fast-paced and pure adventure and excitement by current day standards, but it is excellent in it's own way. This is a simple story being told through the eyes of the protaginist, Jim Hawkins. It is rich and lush with descriptions of the seas and of the bizzare and treacherous characters. From the simpleness of the book, I could place myself into the roll of this young boy and my imagination did the rest. It was an extremely exciting book; but, not because of the action packed descriptions. It was exciting because it was a pure adventure on the high seas, and I really felt like I was looking for the treasure and listening to rugged pirates.The villians were perfect. They were not hard-core grotesque characters, but just balanced with self-preservation and greed. They were not rapists and excessive killers, just evil enough to fear them on the open waters.This book is wonderfully told. If you do not really get into books or don't enjoy excercising your imagination, this book is probably not for you. Otherwise, prepare for a wild adventure on the high seas. Classic story telling. Let your imagination do the rest. Although written primarily for boys, Treasure Island is one of the few books I remember being wildly excited about as a girl. I decided to share it with my 5 year old (who appreciates a pirate adventure) and I am reading a chapter at a time to him at bedtime. Although it is sometimes a little much for a 5 year old (some deaths and pirates with missing body parts) I can read it in a way that interests him. And, it is a great learning experienced due to this \"enriched classic\" version. I can tell my son about real pirates (who he now knows were actually \"bad guys\") and about the way things were in the mid 1700's. I explain a lot as I go, but he is fascinated- and we're learning a lot together! I highly recommend it... especially to read to kids slightly older than my 5 year old. However, this works as well! An adventure in learning! The best edition of Treasure Island on the market. A real shame it's only in print in America, but well worth importing. Solidly bound, on fine paper, with some of the most captivating illustrations in the history of children's literature - and affordable too. A proper heirloom edition. The best edition Exciting in parts. Rather too much sailing detail especially when Jim sailed the Hispaniola by himself (highly unlikely). No information on what happened to Jum when he got home with his ill gotten gains!! Pirates and Jim's crew were after the treasure for themselves and they killed to get there first. There seems to be a moral question there!! Treasure Island Kindle version. I read this book back in my seventh grade literature class and thought I would give it a revisit. Honestly, it was very underwhelming. The action was bland and the tension between good vs. evil withered away near the end. Also, it was very difficult to fully understand the book without looking up each nautical term and pirate jargon found in every line about halfway through the book. Treasure Island was a nice little blast from the past, however, I think I am going to stick with contemporary fiction from now on, or at least something a bit more exciting. Treasure Island Treasure Island is arguably one of the greatest works of storytelling in the English language. Stevenson created other novels, with greater depth and insight, but the highlight of Treasure Island is the combination of color and poetic prose that distinguishes his tale of piracy and boyhood adventure from the rest of the field of other adventure books. The title alone paints an image of suspense, and salty pirates battling over great riches. Most people tend to view Treasure Island as a story for children, but it can be enjoyed by anyone longing for a rollicking adventure. Like so many stories from the 1800s, each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and once you get used to the language the author's humor shines through. One of the greatest pirate stories of all time How to grow from a boy to a man in a very short period of time. I wish I had read this when I was younger. I wouldn't have gone seeking treasure like the story, but maybe I'd have found treasures closer to home. Found treasure",

         "I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars. The language is old and the descriptions go on a bit, but thats what people enjoyed then. Besides there is poetry in it.Tedward One of the best ghost stories ever We all know the story of Dickens' Christmas Carol. I chose this edition because the description indicated that it had good illustrations. We weren't disappointed at all- the paper is nice, heavy, with a touch of cream in the color. The illustrations are all in full color, and found on just about every page. Finding the short story \"The Christmas Tree\" at the end of the book was a nice surprise too! Overall, an excellent addition to our Christmas library. you know the story- but the illustrations make this edition I was watching a cartoon version of this story on the television and I realised that I wanted to read the original.Dickens (obviously) just uses words how direct and simple that is. An antidote to technology. I love Charles Dicken's works, and I think this is the best book for a warm Christmas season! Best book for Christmas Another \"how does he do it\" in Christmas Carol. Brings the story to life as no other presentation. Jim Dale scores again Love this classic christmas story and loved reading it on my ipad. Especially loved that it was free. Thanks amazon! Love this story! I am a Dickens fan but 'A Christmas Carol' isn't my cup of tea...it's dark and sermonising, not what I really want at Christmas time :) I know it's a classic but... This book was absolutely fantastic! It is such a page turner. I highly recommended this book to any child over 10, or whenever they get the hang of reading chapter books. By the way, Charles Dickens writes the best books if your looking to read another book by him. Best Book I've Read in a Long Time!! This book is a an all time classic! I would recommend this book to every book lover. It is a must have in you book collection. A Christmas Carol Dicken's A Christmas Carol is a classic that we often see retold every Christmas. Everyone loves it, but few people have actually read it for themselves. I always prefer reading then viewing the story because then I have to use my own imagination. I would recommend to anyone that at least once they should read the story. Dickens is a wonderful writer although a bit longwinded (He was paid by word when he wrote!). A Classic! I give this five stars as much for its compact form as its literary value. To write a compelling story in 300 pages is difficult, but certainly possible; to weave a complex tale in under 100 requires much greater skill. Dickens does just that, drawing you in with a sparseness of prose that is wonderful. Over-explanation has been excised, and we the reader benefit.Having seen at least five variations on this story, I was surprised at just how simple the source material was. Clean, clear, subtle, and leaving far more to imagination than description, this was a wonderful Christmas read. What else is there to say? It's Dickens in under 100 pages; this is not to be missed. Clean, clear, understated, and thoroughly enjoyable Peculiar as it seems there is surprising and substantial spiritual consolation to be found in finally contriving to live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. Just look at old Scrooge, he whom foul weather didn't know where to have him. Every December I dig this miraculous story afresh and every December timeless new sentences ring out. I think this time through I especially love the way Dickens resoundingly hammers home the death of Jacob Marley right from the get go:\"There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Chruchyard for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\"Amen to that, Charley. With knobs on. \"The inexorable finger underwent no change.\" You can't beat this Charles Dickens classic. Worth a read at Christmastime or really at any time of the year! Classic I love the story & it is part of our yearly Christmas tradition. Every year we start our celebration with watching one of our dvds about Scrooge. I have collected about 6 renditions of the story now so our only debate is which one should we start with each year. We play it during our Christmas tree decorating, but we end up missing a lot of it in the process. I got this book and also the audio so next year we can start with the book and then listen to it as we are decorating. Can't wait! Always a 5 star with me It was great I loved this book it was the best and it is all about Christmas time with families A Christmas Carol If I could have only one book of \"A Christmas Carol\" this is the one that I would want. The illustrations are beautiful. The price was terrific. I liked mine so much that I ordered one for a friend. Love it. Beautiful book A classic, what else does one need to say. Amazon says I have to say 11 more words to submit. Good book A Christmas Carol Audiobookread by Jim DaleI once heard it said that to appreciate Dickens best, one should read his stories aloud. I have never had the time to try to do this, but having just listened to a new unabridged reading of A Christmas Carol from Random House, I can see the validity of the statement. Playing the CD's I felt as if the narrator was, in the words of Dickens himself, &quot;standing in the spirit at your elbow.&quot;And what a narrator! The multi-talented Jim Dale reads the story...no, that is not correct...Jim Dale PERFORMS the story. I counted 42 voices in the three-hour recording. Jim Dale is well known for his over 200 voices (and counting) bringing to life all of the characters in the Harry Potter books, which he also records for Random House's Listening Library.I first saw Jim Dale in the 1977 Disney movie Pete's Dragon where he played the bumbling villain. The next year he played three hilarious characters in another Disney film, Hot Lead and Cold Feet. I was lucky to see him in two musicals on Broadway, in Barnum, and Me and My Girl. Both very memorable performances. I plan to see him next month as he sings and dances Scrooge in Madison Square Garden's Christmas Carol - The Musical. I figure if he is great in the audiobook, he will be even better on stage. An actor has only two tools...his voice and his body. In the audiobooks, of course, only the voice can be used.And Dale's voice talents are well showcased here. I often found myself laughing out loud, thanks to the combined genius of Dickens and Dale. In a couple of cases, the genius is pure Dale. At one point he adds a bit of a dog's panting that really cracked me up.I have seen and/or heard other wonderful actors do one-man renditions of A Christmas Carol. A number of years ago a friend played a tape for me of John Gielgud doing an abridged version. I saw Patrick Stewart do his acclaimed one man show on Broadway; from the first row! And I have seen the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times. They are all memorable and it would be impossible to say which was the best. But I can heartily recommend that Jim Dale's version be added to the family library. It is complete, it is accurate and it is a virtuoso performance.Although I certainly know the story well, I found by listening to the audiobook I was paying closer attention to the lesser known parts...the parts that, to be honest, I usually would skim over when rereading the book. In fact, there were several sections where I felt as if I were hearing them for the first time. Marvelous sections. I couldn't believe I had missed them in the past. Maybe Jim Dale's voice just made them more vibrant than my own inner voice.I suppose that asking me to review Jim Dale reading A Christmas Carol really isn't fair. One of my favorite performers reading my favorite story by my favorite author! But surely I am not alone. Dickens is universally known as England's greatest novelist. I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Dale was gaining a reputation as one of the world's greatest readers of audiobooks. They are both master storytellers. And to quote the Dickens himself, &quot;If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it.&quot; A Christmas Carol to treasure for Christmases yet to come I have read this story before when I was younger. I like the way this book is formatted though. Its a easy story to read and understand. I like how it gives a message of appreciation to the simple stuff in life and to not take everything for granted. I really love reading this during the holidays. Christmas Story Classic Dickens is an incredible author with an amazing heart. This story is fantastic for all ages all year round but especially a wonderful Christmas tale. Great story A Christmas CarolIt was my goal this December to read to my children, ages seven, nine and 14, the Christmas Carol story by Dickens so that they would know the original before seeing the movie. I also thought this would be an accessible way for them to get oriented to English literature and prepare them for further reading.The requirements of the Christmas Carol book to be purchased were that a) it be new as opposed to a ragged used copy, b) it be unabridged, c) it have good drawings; and d) if possible it be inexpensive. I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible. The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods. The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing. Thirteen bucks. I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read. I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on. I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand. Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started. It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days. On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it. But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.Dan of Arlington One of the pillars of the Christmas season I loved reliving this story from my youth. Over the years there have been so many film adaptations of this story and it was nice to see it in its original form. A Christmas Carol A greedy selfish, old coot....a night out with the ghosts..... reborn as the Christmas spirit incarnate.... still brings a tear to my eye A Christmas tradition This is a great book by Charles DIckens. It shows you that no matter how people are to you be nice to them. One day htey might turn around if u just keep encouraging them. Just because there a bad person dont mean u have to be. So if u wanna be like scrooge go ahead, but i wouldnt reccomend it. mean people can change I have read this book and I really enjoyed it. I read it for hours on end trying to reach the end. I suggest it for any one from age 1 to 101. This is an awesome book! Aside from the Bible, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is probably the most familiar and well-known book ever published. Scores of film adaptations have been made over the years, taking Dickens' story of one man's redemption to all the corners of the globe. The name Ebenezer Scrooge immediately brings to mind the miserly curmudgeon whose life and very nature were radically changed after the visitation of four ghosts one early Christmas morning. Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former partner, returns in spirit form to warn Scrooge of the ponderous chain he is forging in life by his penny-pinching, selfish, Christmas-hating ways. Then, of course, the ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future come to call for an increasingly troubled soul who comes to see the worthlessness of his purely materialistic life. A Christmas Carol offers a truly amazing character study. Scrooge, this seemingly incorrigible fellow, quickly becomes a sympathetic character as we view the circumstances of his life. From a lonely boy rejected by his father (who blames him for the death of his wife in childbirth), we see a sensitive soul, one quite capable of feeling and expressing both happiness and love, grow greedy and cold, shutting even the woman he loves out of his life. Completely broken down by the scenes revealed by the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's transformation is remarkably real and powerful.Little need be said about this timeless classic, as it is a story virtually everyone knows in some detail. The message is clear to all of us, as well. Dickens, the social conscience of the 19th century, illustrates the humanity and worth of even the lowliest of society's members and casts the harsh light of truth on those with the means but not the desire to help their fellow man, giving new life to the clich&eacute; &quot;you can't take it with you.&quot; Dickens briefly alludes to the religious aspects of the holiday, but he vividly evokes the true and rightful spirit of Christmas in humanistic terms. This is a timeless story that will forever be a part of each Christmas season. Not only does it impart lessons of the highest order, it never fails to charm and delight you no matter how many times you have previously read the story (and watched the movie adaptations) over the years. Evoking the true spirit of Christmas since 1843 Mr. Baker does a fine job of bringing life to the characters. He does read at a brisk pace so I might have a print copy of the story on hand the next time the family listens to it. Good, clear sound. However, while listening to it in the car we almost had it at full volume because Mr. Baker's would read so softly (and quickly) at times we could barely hear him. We haven't listened to it at home so it might be a different experience. Great Reading The book was about a man that was very mean and a a poor family that had a boy named tiny tim who was crippled and when the ghost of christmas future came he would see that tiny tim would die and on a stone he seen would have his name but in the end he became a nice man he gave the poor mans family some more family. christy hunts review of the christmas carol I like reading from the kindle, no torn pages, lost books, always know where it is, just great and I'll order more. My Kids Loved me reading it to them This classic childhood book is a genius story written by Charles DickinsonAll people of all ages love this classic. Geniuses Truly enjoyed the different way this Charles Dickinson story was written. It was a very entertaining and is still truly the best christmas story. excellent! I enjoyed reading this book this holiday season. It was even better because it was FREE! Wonderful Book! Great book... Haven't read it since high school. Short and didn't take long, but helped get me in the Christmas spirit. I loved it! Enjoyable read, and a great reminder of how kindness and understanding can change the world. I like to read it just after Thanksgiving to put me in the &#34;right frame&#34; of mind Classic For many years, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, has been considered a classic Christmas novel. In America, people are becoming increasingly busy and more concerned with themselves around Christmas time. The spirit of Christmas is making its way out of the American culture and becoming a distant memory. A central theme in \"A Christmas Carol\" is the renewal of this spirit as depicted in the life of the main character Ebeneezer Scrooge.The setting for A Christmas Carol is in London, England during the 19th century. At the time, England was undergoing an industrial revolution. Money was to be made! I feel such is the case today as technology is revolutionizing the way business is run in today's society. The main character, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is a money dealer who, along with his business partner Jacob Marley, gave loans to various people and institutions needing financial assistance. Over the years and after the death of his business partner, the love of money hardened the heart of this once cheerful man. I was reminded, while reading, how money hardens people's heart is found in the world today. Scams are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the news. Truly, money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Throughout the course of this book, Scrooge experiences a change of heart while he reviews Christmas memories and once again discovers what it is like to feel and live the Christmas spirit. As I read this book, I felt that desire--the desire to rediscover what it feels like to live the Christmas spirit. While reading this book, I felt the emptiness that comes when one is focused solely inward during the Christmas season and the joy comes when the spirit of Christmas motivates one to lift and serve others.I am a lover of good literature. Recently, I have noticed myself becoming busier during the Christmas season than in past years. While reading of Scrooges' Christmas memories, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes. By so doing, the spirit of Christmas returned to my life. What a difference that made in my enjoyment of the Christmas season! I recognized what was truly important--remembering Christ by serving others. This book is a great read for anyone; especially those who feel they have lost the Christmas spirit and have the desire to rekindle it again. Renewal of the Christmas Spirit wonderful read at Christmas time, would read every year, next time with the family over a couple of nights. highly recommended great read Normall I don't buy illustrated novels on Kindle because, unless you have a Fire, Kindle and Pictures just don't go together. However, this book was free so I figured, how bad could it be? This worked out great, I got to read a novel I really enjoy, and my daughter got 10 or 12 photos to look at, enhancing her enjoyment of this book. Great book, Kindle pictures were nice this is easily Charles Dickens' best work. a classic tale and it was even better that i got to read it for school! excellent read Filled with wit, humor, and grace, this is without a doubt the most famous and entertaining Christmas story ever. Dickens frightens us one minute, involves us the next, humors us the next but never bores us. If you liked the book try and find the movie version with George C. Scott as Scrooge. I think that's the best film. A Genuine Classic Ebenezer Scrooge is a bitter, miserly old man who is visited by the ghost of his old partner, Jacob Marley. Marley warns Scrooge that three ghosts will visit him and give him one last chance of redemption.The three ghosts of Christmas (Past, Present, and Yet to Come) convince Scrooge to change his ways and to rediscover the kind and generous man he was as a young man.A true Christmas classic and the only Dickens novel that I LOVE. God bless us, every one. To really appreciate the story that most of us know- and to enjoy a story that is truly a masterpiece The Christmas Carol is a must read. Brilliantly Dickens A simple, short read that it a great intro to Dicken's other (much lengthier)stories. \"A Christmas Carol\" is probably only 50 pages in print, but packs enough suspense and character into those 50pages. A great start for anyone itching to read a classic (and possibly thinking of tackling Dicken's other novels!) Classic for the Holidays This story has become an icon for Christmas. The story is well known, but I realized sitting in the new movie with Jim Carrie, I had never read the story itself. How could I judge a movie or play without knowing the written original? There is no way a true critique of a movie or play could be done without having a passing knowledge of the original, especially, since the orginal was presented as a written story.The new movie does follow the written word closely. The plays do not, but they try and do a good job of getting the jist of the story.As for the story, I find it a bit to goody, goody. Scrooge would not turn his life around so thoroughly from such a night of dreams. He is who he is and has been for a very long time. 'Old habits die hard' is not just an old saying. Scrooge has been thinking his frugal thoughts for most of his life and I just do not think he would be able to change so radically so fast. Another problem is Tiny Tim. He may be lovable, but what would move Scrooge to feel so sorry for him? He sees him for only a moment, would it be enough in reality?These questions are irrelevant, but I had them, so I thought I would voice them. An Icon for Christmas The Christmas Carols help me learn the real meaning. IT mean the have the best thing does not ma ke you a better person.Llke Mr. Scooge in this book he had all th money in the town ,and did not give any to the poor. A Christmas Carols Amazing book, Dickens really proved himself with this one. Good read for any age and reading skill level. Must read! Very nice holiday classic When I was a child my father would read A Christmas Carol to me during the week before Christmas. I had been trying to find an unabridged, beautifully illustrated edition to read to my granddaughter. I finally found it in this magnificent rendition of the great Dickens tale. This is a book that is sturdy enough to pass to multiple generations with pride and share the real spirit of Christmas. It also makes one appreciate the elegance of Victorian grammar. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Beautiful Unabridged Edition As far as Christmas traditions go, this is one of my favorites. Its primary theme of redemption of the soul gives hope to us all, and all who feel the weight of greed and commercialism during the holidays should read this to lift their spirits. Let us all toast Ebenezer Scrooge with a Merry Christmas! And God bless us everyone! A Christmas Carol Every Christmas season I watch various versions of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; either on TV or as movies and I just wanted to remind myself of what the original was as to structure and storyline as each of the movie versions has its own take on the import of the story.Charles Dickens crafts a wonderful story that should be read by all to remind us of the wonderfulness of the season Still a great story \"No space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused\"Ebenezzer Scrooge is one of the most miserly, greedy, selfish businessmen, especially at Christmas. Through the visions of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, and three Ghosts, Scrooge is sent on the learning experience of a life.There is a reason why this book is so prevalent in our (Western) culture, how everyone, even those who've never read the novella/book, know the story so well (which is why this review will not have any spoiler notices). This story is a story that hits us to the core, that forces us to look outside our selfish lives and to think of others. And while the characters aren't the most nuanced, it is the story, it is the heart of the book that is most important and most inspiring.The characters are rather one-note, if you think about it. Scrooge is the only one that undergoes any change (somewhat expected, as it is a novel about his growth), but he starts out as the hideously over-done selfish man and ends up as the happiest, most joyful man in the world. Seeing his drastic change, however, does make the story more compelling, which is probably why Scrooge was painted so over-the-top in the beginning. From his little sister to Belle to Bob Crachit and his family, the characters tend to be blindly cheerful and happy despite their conditions. About the only one I can think of off the top of my head that isn't is Mrs. Crachit, who definitely harbors some resentment to Mr. Scrooge.But the remarkable thing about \"A Christmas Carol\" isn't the nuanced, varied characters, but the story, the journey, Scrooge's miraculous change. Reading it for the second time (I read it once in high school on my own), I was still touched and intrigued. I discovered more of the humor (the bit about Marley being more of \"gravy than of grave\"), the deeper meaning of the story. A lot of times, it seems that movies take the bits about Scrooge celebrating and honoring Christmas, and while that is an important theme, I thought the more important theme was to look out for your neighbor and open your heart.Scrooge was miserly, giving his employee a crappy wage (something like 15 shillings a week!). He refused to have anything to do with his nephew, he wouldn't give to the poor, and he had no compassion for beggars. While he lived in a huge home, he only lit a single candle and lived in a single room. And as the Ghosts reveal his past, present, and future, he slowly realizes, \"Hey, I should have been nice to that kid on the street\", \"Hey, I wish I had agreed to visit my nephew\", and \"Hey, I should do something about my employee's work conditions\".And that is why this book is so great, in my opinion. Christmas is one day and not everyone celebrates it the same way (or at all!); but kindness and generosity can be expressed ALL YEAR LONG and EVERYONE can share it. That is how I interpret it when Scrooge says, near the end: \"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year\". Christmas isn't the Christian holiday, or the commercialized version that we see all around us; Christmas is the compassion we have to those around us.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light* \"No space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused\" The dialect may seem a bit dated, but this short novel could easily become a classic! I might even read it again next December. A Dickens of a novel! writing style was somewhat different back in those days but still easy to understand. Also interesting to see the difference between the original book and the movie version Old story but still interesting. Have only seen the movie version in the past This book is excelent for those of you that are kids or that enjoy thinking as a kid. Its written in a way that makes you feel like a kid and of course tries to teach you the real meaning of christmas.I would recommend it even to non christian readers because in some chapters makes you wonder about why we speak the way we do and you can extrapolate his lesson to be that every action has its consequences in others. It deserves to be a classic This is a delightful edition of Dickens's classic and includes a couple of extra bonuses after the conclusion of the book that are pleasing as well. One certainly cannot top a classic. Highly recommended! Can't top a classic! Jonathan Winters does a good job of narrating this Christmas classic, but the abridgment is pretty severe. Too much good stuff is left out. I prefer the unabridged Jim Dale version. My favorite is the unabridged cassette version read by Paul Scofield, but it seems to be out of print. If I could find that one on CD, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Abridged version leaves out a lot I couldn't stop reading, a good classic story. One of the best story's I have ever read&#8230; :-) Just classic. A great book! this is not the best of Charles Dickens but it is one of his triumphs and his shortest book.it is about a grumpy man named Scrooge who hates christmas and calls it humbug and one noight he meets the ghost of his old friend Marly folowed b three mysterious ghost the first of christmas past and takes him to when he was younger, then the ghost of christmas present showing him what is hapening right then, then the ghost of Christmas In the Future and shows what will happen and how he will be buried and when he wakes up he has a change of mind and makes his poor employee Bob Cratchet and as punishment for being late he gives him a raise. this is highly recomended to people from 10-50 even though i read it when i was 6 but i do not think that other 6 year ols would eenjoy it as much.Caleb A. Craig. Wonderfully Spooky. This book is one of the most meaningful of all time and one I think should be read more often than just watched on television during the Christmas season. It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirits visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonymously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old. greedy to giving After years of watching countless versions of the movie I decided to read the book. Glad I did well worth it, very short if I'd had the time would've done it in one sitting. Might make it a new Christmas tradition. Excellent! What a joy to be reminded of what great writing is still to be found amongst the rubbish of today! Great Writing A must read classic. Dickens can write a great read. The movie can not compare to the actual reading of the story itself. A Christmas carol Loved this book! I will read this each year. I read it with my children and they loved it too! I recommend it for everyone. Excellent book! grandchildren loved it I read it to them Christmas Eve before bedtime and have rear it many more times and each time they love it love it Christmas Carol was a very interesting book you have feeling s in this book when you read through staves Read this book book an you will remember it by heart like I did! Christmas Carol Free! It was free. Have always loved this Dickens classic. The story has been done over and over, but here is the original. The flowery form of speech loses me at times, and some references obscured by time. I did try the Kindle2's explantion feature a couple of times, but it slowed down the flow of reading. Still a great read. Fun to read this classic for free I'm pretty sure I was supposed to read this at some point or another in my school career, but I didn't. I downloaded this for free to my Kindle, and read it in one day. It was a great book, wonderful classic, and for the 3 words I didn't know, it was nice to have the built in dictionary of the Kindle tell me what they meant! Everyone should definitely read this in their lifetime. Good Book In my life I'd heard about \"A Christmas Carol\" so many times I thought I'd actually read the story. Who has not heard the words: \"Bah! Humbug\" or known that Scrooge was one of the most disagreeable characters in literature? This story is fairly short and only takes a few hours to read but it will leave you with the hope that if Scrooge could change there is hope for everyone. The plot is simple. Scrooge is visited by his dead friend Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three spirits. These three spirits take him on different journey's to show him memories from his past, what is happening in the present and then what will happen in the future if he continues to live his life in a selfish way. During these journey's we get some insight into why Scrooge became such a horrid man. This story is great to read at Christmas time and it has a very happy ending.~The Rebecca Review Hope I never read the book and wanted a Kindle version that nicely presented with a few illustrations. This one was it. Great storyline. No wonder this a classic. Great Kindle version of a great book. I think A Christmas Carol is a great book for small children to learn and understand the meaning of Christmas. A Christmas Carol A Christmas classic with high sentimental value. As always, wading through Dickens prose is no easy task. But it is worth the effort Who doesn't love this story? You can't go wrong with Charles Dickens. Especially in reading this original, well-known, classic novel. Check out my review of A Christmas Carol on my blog:http://trivialreviews.blogspot.com/2011/12/if-you-are-going-to-read-christmas.html You Really Can't Go Wrong Wonderful prose depicting the spirit of Christmas and how man and mankind must change. It's a must read for anyone around the holidays. Classic Christmas It's always good to read the classics again. this in my books is great holiday time reading. true to the original, but slightly off in some parts. no complains. good fireside reading. love the classics This wonderful Dickens classic is great to read on Kindle with its illustrations. I try to read CHRISTMAS CAROL each holiday season. Reading it on Kindle is a new experience and a fabulous value for a buck. A Classic Had seen the movie in many different versions many times. First time reading the book, excellent book. I have just started reading classic novels recently and this one the first one I read. Glad I did. Well worth the time. Great classic. This is the classic tale by of Ebenezer Scrooge who receives a visit from the ghost of Marley, his late business partner, on Christmas Eve. Scrooge then travels to the past, present, and future with three ghosts. The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Schrooge what his funeral will be like and what the future holds if he doesn't mend his ways. This is a story that lifts up one's spirits, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year. I recommend it highly to everyone. I usually reread it every Christmas. Several individuals have also pointed out that not only is this an early time-traveling story (perhaps the earliest), it is also probably the earliest story about alternative futures, later popular among science fiction writers as well as historians. A classic tale that lifts up one's spirit Like everybody else, I've seen the movies and heard the story over and over, but still decided to grab a copy of the book. I've had other copies that have been lost over the years, but for $1 why not replace it?It's a short book, one you could get through in a night or two if you tried, that every christmas fan should keep on the shelf.C'mon Dover, give us some more thrift editions! Christmas Classic for $1? Why Not?! This review is of the free version of the story.Overall, a very disappointing read. The story is superb, probably the best Christmas story other than the story of Christmas itself, but the formatting is outright horrible. No effort was put into proper conversion from print to ebook. It was literally scanned with text recognition and exported to HTML. There are characters that display incorrectly because they are just 'typed' and are not the correct code. The page numbers from the print version are randomly scattered through the text, making it very hard to read. There are no page breaks, no table of contents, and absolutely no formatting whatsoever. Some text is in caps, other text in bold, you know where I'm going. Download it and see for yourself.You are better off spending $.99 on a decently formatted version of this story. I have tried a sample of several versions and this one has left me fairly happyA Christmas Carol, as it looks to be very professionally done(Embedded cover, active table of contents, page-breaks, appropriate 'stave' headings, etc. I imagine it will be the same way throughout the book). Will buy it soon. Free version I love the free books for the Kindle and Kindle daily deals. They greatly expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library as well as allow us to keep a copy as long as we need. school resource Free Kindle version of the classic holiday tale. Easy to read -- only drawback of course is the free version contains no images/drawings. But if all you want are the words as a reminder or something to check a quote, then this version is perfect. I find when I have time to re-read some favorite passages from the classics and the free Kindle version works well for that.

Ebenezer Scrooge is a bloke that pretty much anybody who came across him would classify as a miserable old coot.When he is particularly miserable towards an employee at xmas, a few spooky spectral spirits take him to task. Free SF Reader A very dear friend of mine gave me a copy of Roberto Innocenti's lavishly illustrated take on Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" A holiday classic in its own right (check out the wonderful 1938 cinematic adaptation starring Reginald Owen, newly released on DVD for the first time), Innocenti's incredibly detailed watercolours bring Dickens' London to life: we peer through windows to see mothers caring for sick children, see delights piled up in shop windows, and small details that give depth to the story (the Dutch-tiled fireplace in Scrooge's home, the Cratchit threadbare hovel). The paper stock is very good quality, as is the ink. A worthwhile investment for children old enough to appreciate this timeless tale, sure to become a treasured symbol of Christmas. Absolutely gorgeous keepsake of a beloved Christmas classic This reading was perfect! Tom Baker does great voices and does not read too fast. My 7th graders were able to follow along in their books and enjoyed listening. A Christmas Carol: An Unabridged Reading by Tom Baker I wanted to get my son this Christmas Classic and was thrilled to find such a beautiful copy of it at such an affordable price on Amazon. The illustrations are terrific and it will be a Christmas treasure for him for many years. Thank you so much. Beautiful book Motivational story about being generous, caring, and cherishing loved ones before death. Despite the Christmas theme, it's a great read for everyone. Enjoyable read How could you not read this every Christmas? This is a personal tradition of mine, I highly recommend that everyone tune into the Christmas spirit with this short classic. Love it Loved reading this book during the christmas time. Very enjoyable. I recomend it for anyone. A book that needs to be read every year. great christmas read Great classic book for Christmas time. Every parent should make this a tradition . And read this to your children young & old. Classic Critiquing Dickens' Christmas Carol is a misnomer. Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \"Scrooge,\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today! Beyond Critique I wanted to do something for my family to bring back the Christmas Sprit of old. This was just the thing. The book is wonderful and the art work is excellent! This is a treasury that can be passed down through the family for years. A Christmas Carol Have been collecting movies based on the Dicken's Christmas Carol for years. Looked for an unabridged copy of the book in hardback and was delighted to find this one. The price was great and service was fast. I am very pleased with this purchase. Great Buy This is a great book for everyone! I just got done reading it for school! It really shows the different families in that time period of London! I dont want to give to much away! A MUST READ! Plus its a very short book! You could read it in an hour! WOW! Wonderful story . . . Great to include the original illustrations! It is a classic yet very easy to read. A Christmas Carol What an amazing story. As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after. My students remember the Muppets and Mickey Mouse versions, and while they are pretty good for nostalgic purposes, this read really brings about the true message of living with Christmas in your heart. To some people this may seem like a &#34;dark&#34; book, but that was the purpose; to scare the readers into the realization that there are consequences for our actions. Christmas Classic Pros: Feel good story, great for Christmas time.Cons: Setup and payoff are weak.A Christmas Carol is a classic that everyone should read. Unfortunately, I did not read it until I was well into my adulthood. My review will focus on aspects of the story from that angle.The initial part of the story provides the reader with a portrait of Ebenezeer Scrooge that is a little overdone and a bit comical. I can only say that it came across as being a bit 'corny.'The best part of the story lies in its middle chapters, where Mr. Scrooge receives upon himself several visitors during the night. As a reader you feel drawn into the lives of the families that are visited and you find yourself caring for them rather quickly.The payoff ends up being somewhat weak. It seems rushed and concluded rather a little too hastily. A slightly lengthier expansion of the final pages would have increased enjoyment of the story immensely.Still, even with such criticisms, I realize that the story will appeal to people of all ages, and have given the book a 5 star rating. I encourage parents to let their children enjoy this classic as soon as they think it is age appropriate and not view the book with a little bit of a cynical eye, as I myself might have had. Have your kids read it. Adults need to check their cynicism at the door. If you have not read this book to your children or have not read it yourself....you are missing out on the understated meanings behind this wonderful classic. A must for any library!!!! Exceptional Story of Redemption Just got my I pad and I'm loving this book. Hope to get more. The price is right for a classic, free. First time Great classic read. This book is wonderful to read time after time. Charles is an amazing writer and his book is hard to put down. A Christmas Carol review This was my first book on My Kindle Fire that I got yesterday, and now, I loved Charles Dickens. I always knew the story but I never really read the book. It was great. My First Book on My Kindle Fire. I enjoy reading the books by Charles Dickens, but for some reason I had not read A Christmas Carol. I very much enjoyed the book and will make re-reading A Christmas Carol a new holiday tradition. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens I had been wanting to pick up a copy of this classic for quite some time. the story of redemption in this book is so uplifting, I wanted to share it with my children. I was looking for a copy that would have that rich-feeling to it. I wanted it to have some pictures to show my kids as they are still young and I want to keep them interested in the story. This copy is perfect. I was leery when I ran a search on this site. I got a few hits, but nothing that really struck me as the \"definite\" copy I was looking for.If you are looking for an heirloom quality copy, this might not be it......at least not for a couple more decades......as I believe this book will wear nicely and be a great piece once the pages start to yellow. The type set is very neat and easy to read, and the plethora of pictures, which don't detract from the story, are beautiful.Pick this up for yourself and your family, you will be glad that you did. Very Pleased It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie It was a good book and a short book too This book touched my heart. I have an old man in my neighborhood who reminds me of Scrooge,but he hates Halloween. Anyway,this book was great. Enough said. One pleasant book This is a cleverly worded, interesting book. It is almost certainto absorb readers!The movie is fantstic also! And I'm sure you would like it! A Christmas Carol Have seen what seems like about every movie ever made about A Christmas Carol, but had never read the book and always wanted to. Finally decided to read the book and it wasn't disappointing. A little hard to read at times because it has some of the old English in it, but generally a very good book Book was as good as the movies Great Kindle Reader version. The illustrations are perfect to help visualize the story. You cannot beat the classics for a quiet read. Classics can't be beat As Scrooge says as he wakes Christmas morning and walks through the streets-- WON-DER-FUL! This is my feeling on A Christmas Carol. This was my first experience with Dickens and after reading this-- sure won't be my last. I was expecting a stuffy old novel and got blind-sided by a brilliant work of fiction. I have to thank Amazon for these freebies on kindle, probably would have never got around to reading it. To all you out there who are familiar with the classic tale from movies will be pleasantly surprised to find it WAY better to read. I look forward to more Dickens in the future! WON-DER-FUL! my favorite part was when jacob marley showed up i liked the three spirits when they apeared i thought it could use some more pictures it also could tell what some of the words mean other than that it was pretty good summary of a christ carol I have loved listening to his voice ever since hearing the Harry Potter books on CD (which are awesome as well). He really captures the feel of this book and does a great job as always. Jim Dale is Great For over 60 years I'd heard the story, I'd seen the play, I'd watched the movies - all of them (I like the George C. Scott one the best), but I had never read the book. I was not the least disappointed with the book. It had just enough back-story that didn't come across on stage or screen to make it new and still the same wonderful story. My Favorite Christmas Story I got this for my Kindle for free. Great story to share with the family as well as with my students! FREE, Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol is read annually along with any and all movie versions. The tale is so simple yet so full of detail. Scrooge is every man who lets life get him down until something changes the status quo. The use of spirits to guide a person to a better path in life is so in tune with the 1990s where everyone is searching for miracles whether they involve spirits or angels or whatever. A true classic that has withstood the test of time and will continue to delight for generations to come. Bah Humbug to all who dont read this holiday classic! I will admit that, until now, I have never read \"A Christmas Carol\", but instead - like most Americans - have watched countless film and cartoon versions, from the wonderfully classic 1951 film version with Alstaire Sim and the Mister Magoo cartoon version to the most recent film incarnation starring Jim Carrey. Having just purchased a Kindle, I decided to take advantage of the free copy offered in the classics section of the Kindle site so I could finally read the actual Dickens tale. I was certainly not disappointed.I won't bother with a rehash of the story - who doesn't know this tale? - but will only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend to everyone that they put it on their \"to read\" list (it's a rather short story, I was surprised to discover). As an actor and filmmaker, I was particularly interested in comparing the story to the many film and cartoon versions I referenced above, and this has given me a new appreciation for those versions that were truer to the original, capturing the \"right mood\" and maintaining a sense of anticipation, fear, wonder, melancholy, and - ultimately - pure joy.You don't have to relegate your reading of this tale to Christmas time, so I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. For those who have read it, it's worth a return visit. I finally READ \"A Christmas Carol\" The book was really good, I think it was better than the movie. I would recommend this book to adolescents or adults. I'm a 13 year old boy, and I saw the movie so I thought I might try the book. It really surprised me that the book was way better than the movie. I loved it and I would read it everywhere and at anytime. I read the book whither my brother and he's nine, and he loved the book. The book is hard to understand but you will figure it out as you keep reading. I hope my review helped you think about what to read next, and if you chose this book I hope you enjoy it.Thank you. Great book When my son came home from school with exhaustive reading assignments from this book, I knew I had better follow it along with him in order to be ready with an answer when he asked. I had read it in the past, but the questions that the teacher asked required detailed reading. As usual, the quality of the ebook was excellent, but as was expected, his reading was based on page numbers that don't exist in the Kindle format. However, the fact that it was portable and I could read ahead when waiting in line or had a few down minutes made it worth the purchase. Perfect for required reading I like to read it when it is Christmas and Christmas eve before me and my family go to bed. Nice book for my family. a pageturner for romantic souls and amateurs of beautiful (old) english prose. Dickens' narrative style is beyond competition. A must-read ! Timeless classic I hadn't read the entire Christmas Carol in quite some time, and I was very pleased to find an extremely cheap paperback that was NOT an adaptation. As far as I can tell, this is the complete and unabridged version, with a few illustrations. It's very inexpensive, but is not made as cheaply as some paperbacks, so I don't think it will fall apart immediately. Here's hoping! So far, it seems as sturdy as any other well-made paperback, and we really enjoyed reading it this year. excellent version--NOT an adaptation! It's a classic, the illustrations in it are wonderful. Even if you know the story by heart, It's a must read for the holiday season. Must read I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did. Now I know why it is such a favorite. This is regarding the audio book performed by acting legend John Gielgud. I love Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\". It's one of my very very favorite stories, and I love this audio version, but I see references to other performers and formats in the reviews on this page. Do Not Confuse this version with any of those others. I have _this_ version on CD. I wish I could find it. I listen to it many times each Christmas season. Audio quality is good. His performance is rich and wonderful. It _is_abridged_ which I don't like, but I still recommend it. John Gielgud is _more_ than worth it (If you don't know him, he was the butler in the movie \"Arthur\" starring Dudley Moore.) PERFORMED BY GIELGUD, JOHN This is a wonderful book. The drawings alone are worth the price of the book. Each drawing is beautifully done and follows along with the story. This is the unabrdged edition which I personally prefer; however, be aware that there will be an occassional paragraph with old English words and references that will be difficult to understanad unless you are an English scholar. These are infrequent and do not detract from the story - in fact, it adds charm and authenticity. Better than having some editor arbitrarily determining what you should read and what should be cut out. I believe the Amazon price for this book was $12.00 - an amazing bargain. Ingpen, the artist, has illustrated many other \"childrens\" books and we will be buying them. Highly recommended. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Dickens Book",

         "I started reading the Paolini books after I was done with the Harry Potter books. I was intrigued by the story line and quickly got enveloped in the story. It was a great read, even better on cd - actually, MUCH better on cd because you don't have to figure out how to pronounce the words - This author is extremely talented and I cannot wait until the third book of the series comes out. One of my favorite books \"Eldest\", second book in Christopher Paolini's \"Inheritance\" triology, picks up where \"Eragon\" ended, and allows us to know what is going to happen with Eragon, Saphira and their friends, and what they will need to do in order to survive the wrath of king Galbatorix. If you haven't read the first book in the series, please do so before tackling this one. You can understand what happens in \"Eldest\" without having read \"Eragon\", but I think you will not enjoy what happens half as much.Now, my opinion regarding \"Eldest\". Truth to be told, I loved the first book in the series, but I liked this one even more. From my point of view, Paolini manages to make Eragon's world more believable, without letting the magic go. That doesn't mean that this book is perfect, or that it doesn't have some scenes that are somewhat slow. All the same, I think it deserves 5 stars because it is the kind of book you cannot stop reading once you start, the kind of book that makes you wish you could read the final book of the triology instead of having to wait for it.What is new in \"Eldest\", then? Well, Eragon has to travel to Ellesmera (the land of the Elves), in order to continue his training as a dragon raider. Along the way he will meet some new friends and foes, and discover new information about people he already knew. Also, the author introduces an alternative point of view in the story, that of Roran, Eragon's cousin. Roran and Eragon are far from each other, and must to face different challenges and enemies, but they have something in common: some chapters of \"Eldest\" will be about Eragon's adventures, and others about what is happening to Roran and his followers. As if that were not enough, we will discover two more dragon riders, and learn about what happened to Murtagh and Eragon's mother.Of course, that are just some of the things you will find in \"Eldest\". The more important reason to read it is the opportunity to immerse you once again in the adventures of Eragon and Saphira, and become a dragon rider yourself, if only for a few hours. Highly recommended !Belen AlcatPS: To Christopher Paulini --> Please hurry up with the last book in this triology, I really want to know what happens next :) I really want to know what happens next :) From what I've seen, Paolini's main talent lies in his ability to create riveting story lines and a fairly likeable cast of characters. Unfortunately, this ability is offset by his writing, which is often awkward and full of simple mistakes. As a teen myself, I respect Paolini for his persistance in having completed and published a novel at such a young age, but his writing ability itself is nothing special in comparison to many other advanced enlgish students.Eldest starts out slowly, but as the pace picks up, the writing improves to the point that by about halfway through the book, it is no longer offensive. The plotline bogs down at times, particularly during the mindnumbingly long descriptions of Eragon's training period, and at times the novel is overly blatant in its attempts to tackle various issues of morality. However, despite the book's various - and rather numerous - problems, it is hard not to care about Eragon, Paolini's endearing main character; it was this, as well as the rather obviously imminent return of Murtagh, the novel's most interesting and multidimensional character, that kept me reading to the end. It Could Be Worse - It Could Be Eragon I started Eldest immediately after reading Eragon, and my expectations were extremely high. While Eragon had many similarities to LOTR, I still thought that, on the whole it was a fairly original fantasy tale. Eldest simply takes off from right where Eragon left the series, and the book doesn't let go until you've read all 700 pages.Eldest consists of three main narratives. Obviously, Eragon continues his journey to become a true rider, and he journeys to the Elven city of Ellesmera to complete his training. The training is interesting, and the dialogue between Eragon and his master, Oromis, is intriguing enough to the point where you don't really care that there isn't too much action actually taking place. The second narrative that is followed is that of the Varden, after they have fled to Surda to gather their forces to make a stand against Galbatorix and the empire. The third (and best) narrative follows Eragon's cousin, Roran, and his dealings back in Carvahall, which, needless to say, are very dire. Roran is probably the best character that Paolini has created in this series. He is hardened but still emotional and thoughtful. Roran's trek through Alagaesia with the town of Carvahall behind him is definitely the most enthralling part of the book.Paolini also creates a very magical, mysterious world that the elves live in. Eragon's instruction provides the reader a way to learn more about the magic that is used by the elves, and the possibilities that Eragon can accomplish when he completes his training as a rider.To top it all off, the final battle scene of the book is amazing, and it ends with a killer twist that left he wishing the third book was already published.Don't read this book if you're expecting to read a writer capable of Tolkien-style prose. Paolini and no other will ever come close to him. Read it for the magical world that is created, and the great characters that can be bonded with and rooted for, or even loved. Normally, the second part in a trilogy is always the weakest, and Eldest as a book is many things, but weak is not one of them. Better than Eragon I suppose since I was mailed an advance reader copy I should extoll the virtues of this book and give it high praise like everyone else, but that would be a lie. I can't believe I waited two years for this. Such a disappointment after the promise of \"Eragon\".\"Eragon\" wasn't a perfect book, but it was at least a halfway decent read. This book is no where near as good as recent reads like Robert Stanek's magnificent \"Keeper Martin's Tale\". I would recommend that book (and series) instead. Disappointing........... I must say that the Inheritance Trilogy has to be one of the best stories i have ever read. you people out there who think it has connections to the LOTR or Star Wars are completly out of your minds. A few names in Eragon and Eldest that happen to resemble a few name in the LOTR or Star Wars is not enough to critisize this book in the way you have. Plagerism is a serious cahrge and a few names are not enough to critisize like that. all you wanna-be critics out there who think Paolini ripped off other books for ideas have to look at the book again and see the story for what it really is. a well written piece of Fiction that has captured the hearts of readers everywhere( including mine). the blood and gore is part of the book if you don't like it don't read it again. The battle at the end of Eldest had to be long, i bet money and my house that if Paolini made the Battle at the end of Eldest shorter you would have whinned about it being short too. the Battle couldn't be described at any shorter length than what it was. if it had the ending would have sucked and i would be writing hate mail just like all you people who got on here and critisized the work of this author. i still don't see how you could, even for a second, begin to say the world Paolini created was ripped off. the ancient language is a work of art worthy of a readers praise. think of the time it must have took him to think of that language. he didn't just put letters together and call it a language, the language flows to smoothly for that. he had to make it into a speakable language. and one more thing, i don't see a language guide in the back of the LOTR, paolini took the time to make that guide, so shutup and be gratful it is even their. can't wait for the third book. a Amazing what people critisize these days!!!!! I have had vast experiences with fantasy books and I believe that if you're a fan of Terry Brooks and J.R.R Tolken you will fall in love with Eldest. Christopher Paolini does a superb job of creating a wide variety of believable character that you can really understand and fell empathy and anger. The plot line in this book is just as good as Christopher Paolini fist novel Eragon and follows a much more complex story line throwing politics into the mix. After waiting for over two years for this novel it kept my interest better than the first and I still can't wait for the third book to come out.Eldest takes off at the end of first book Eragon. Withen the first few pages of the book a key character is murdered and Eragon and his dragon Saphira a plunged into two wars one that is obvious, Eragon fighting the empire, and one that is less obvious, the political war that now envelops him. During this book Eragon also finds a surprisingly new teacher and find a new enemy. Also new in this book is the \"second\" story told from Eragon's cousin Roran adding new depth to the book. The book ends with a thematic climax that leaves the reader hungry for more. I consider Christopher Paolini won of the worlds best fantasy authors and can't wait for his next book. I hope this helped you in making the choice to buy this book or not. A great sequal I am enjoying this second novel in the series as it has a wider scope and broader plot. I think that the author is growing up with his characters and we see them having crushes, making silly mistakes and learning from them. Both Eragon and Saphira are maturing into quite complex characters. However I think that the author needs to read more widely and have a broader life experience to match the appeal of McCaffery, Tolkein and Rowling for example. I hope after the third in this series he will have a break to do these things and then come back to write some more fantasy as he obviously has a liking and a talent for it. I am looking forward to reading a lot of his books! Good second novel I was at Borders bookstore last week and I picked up a copy of this book because the cover was very catchy. However, I realized that the coverof this book had to be very catchy because the contents inside the book were nothing but a load of dung. The primary theme across the entire book was...\"here's something I want you to know, but I' can't tell you yet...but if you slog through 700 pages you'll get closer to knowing I'm not going to tell you anything or do anything in this book.\" It was quite annoying, and I found myself saying to myself...\"ok, ok, I got the point 20 pages ago!\" Nothing here, only babbling and rambling about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Don't waste your time on this one...spend your money on something more worth while! Don't waste your money on this book. I realise that this review runs contrary to many of the preceding reviews, but I must say that I enjoyed Eldest far more than Eragon. Yes, I see strains of Star Wars, LOTR, Dragonriders, etc., but I felt that the story flowed far more smoothly than the previous title. One of the complaints of the first book that I had was that it was too stilted, too formulaic. While still an impressive work for one of Paolini's age at the time, it nonetheless made for akward reading at times.It is true that perhaps too much space is given to description, but barring that (I'm the kind of reader who tends to skim through such areas anyway, even in LOTR), I found the book much more engrossing and readable. To each his own! When reading the Amazon reviews before borrowing this book from my younger brothers, I fully expected Eldest to pale in comparison to Eragon, but in my humble opinion, it is the other way around. I hope that Paolini manages trim down on his penchant for describing every scene and event in the 3rd book, but regardless, I eagerly await book 3! Better than the first! I'm almost done finished reading this book and for 45 year old reader I'm really enjoying this read. Though I'm trying to figure out why so many so-called fantasy readers are so critical. Sure he's a young writer and undoubtedly will make errors and make mistakes,but why can't we as readers at least be a little more understanding,or if you can't be understanding DON'T BUY HIS BOOKS. I enjoyed Eragon and I love Saphira that's why I'm reading this book. Sure Eragon is screwing up if he didn't he wouldn't learn anything. I enjoyed this series a lot more than I ever did Harry Potter. Very few first time authors ever hit pay-dirt in success with readers,I'm sure Tolkien had his critics when he first wrote Lord of the Rings. I for one am glad to be reading this series and will continue to finish reading the third book wheb it comes out. I've read a lot of fantasy series some I've liked and lot I've haven't but please don't trash a young writer who's trying if you nay-sayers don't like his books let's see if you could do any better than Christopher. See how your first book would do with the critics. Great read for a young author................ From the moment that I recieved this book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to continue reading from the very first page until the last page. I highly recomend this book and I suggest that if you haven't read the first book, buy it and read it now!!!! As an elementary teacher, I urge my students to read the books. Breathtaking! I confess to being floored with the first book of this trilogy. I had not clue an author so young could write a book as long and as excellent as Christopher Paolini had accomplished. Then he did not quit there. He wrote the next book and made it more exciting and realistic than the first. I applaud his efforts and his excellent writing skills.Though Eldest seemed a lot longer then Eragon and a little less action packed I thought Paolini outdid himself this time. He delved deeper into his characters and I longed to have a dragon of my own at most points in the story. If you have read the first you cannot skip over this astonishing sequel. Much of the mystery of the first seems to come to gether in this book, and yet at the end you are still left shocked and longing for more.I cannot wait for the third and I will be reading Eragon and Eldest over and over again to prep for the final book as I am unwilling to overlook the smallest connections. As Excellent as Eragon I liked parts of this book better then Eragon. The story was slower, and as an earlier reviewer mentioned, this tends to happen with the middle book of a trilogy. The battle at the end of this was moderately entertaining. Eragon's training was also moderately interesting. I would say that you could use those words to adequately describe the book: moderately interesting and moderately entertaining. Somehow, though, I couldn't put the book down so the author did something right! I liked the interaction between Saphira and the other dragon. That was kind of cute. I liked when he was getting trained and seeing a bit of how the elves live.Now for the bad...I did not like how the book bounced back and forth from Eragon to Roran. I am assuming that his high profile in this book is setting up an even greater importance in the third (there is that third egg) book. I can't say I particularly like his character though. I only marginally like Eragon himself, for that matter. The \"relationship\" between Eragon and Arya isn't compelling. He acts like a little boy with a crush and it is irritating. I believe that Paolini is setting it up so we find out that Arya is in love with him too and we find out in the third book that they will have that \"epic love\" described in the first... it just doesn't feel right. It certainly reflects the age of the author and negatively impacts the story. I liked it but... Eldest picks up very smoothly from where Eragon left off and paints us a vivid picture of the world which Mr. Paolini has envisioned. Though the plot revolves around prophesies and interaction between ancient races, we can sympathize with the young man who is caught up in these events while he struggles with his feelings for a woman he can never have.It is obvious that the author has been influenced by other stories (and Star Wars immediately comes to mind), however that does not detract from the fact that he tells the story well and the characters' personalities are well-crafted. Based on archtypes, the characters have their own depth and that, after all, is what makes a story worth reading.I was pleased to see how his cousin reacted to Eragon's departure and to the danger their village was placed in. Even knowing why Eragon had left, I could not help but feel the same resentment and anger.The ending of Eldest had a good combination of tying up lose ends (Eragon is more able to face his destiny than he was at the start) and new plot openings. I am eagerly awaiting the next volume for Inheritance! Statisfying continuation I loved this book. The story was so intriguing with so much going on that I just couldn't put it down. I must admit that I put off reading this book for a couple of months because of some of the bad reviews but I'm kicking myself now and I'm really glad I finally ignored those and read it for myself.This book is fully of action and adventure and plot that you're just begging for the story to show itself. The story telling is just amazing. That's the key word here story telling. This book does not have near as much violence, battle scenes and daring rescues as Eragon but to me, it more than makes up for it in story development. This book just perfectly setups things up for the final volume.In this book you get to see the development and maturity of Eragon, his background and his family. You learn more about the Elves, the Riders, the Urgals etc etc. and in between it does have a lot of action, intrigue, battles and rescues to keep you interested but not at the same level as other books do (which I believe is part of the reason why some people disliked it). (For those who want books with little or no plot but tons of action I recommend anything written by Clive Cussler)I also admit that there are a lot of similarities between this trilogy and other fantasy and fiction books out there, namely LoTR and Star Wards but by no means is the author plagerizing. He just uses a lot of the same themes and ideas in his own unique way and he uses them to tell a brilliant story.GREAT BOOK.... I can't wait until the third one comes out!!!!!! Well written book.... I couldn't put it down!!! I've read a lot of other reviews that say that this book was slow. I disagree. I liked how things actually happened in this book. Reading about Eragon's training in Du Weldenvarden was awesome, and I loved all the tension between Arya and Eragon.Hearing about Roran's trials was very interesting. I was glad to be able to see into his life and his hardships.The end was action-packed and not without a few twists. It definately left me waiting for the next book.I, personally, thought that Eragon was a lot slower than this book. Eldest was much easier to get into, and near the end I couldn't put it down. I thought it was great! This book was just as entrancing as the first, Eargon. I think the author uses wonderful language and beautiful descriptions.The others who claim it was boring only say that because the things that were easy to predict from the first book didn't occur until the last 50 pages of this long story. Which I have found is how most trilogies are written.I recommend the book to anyone who likes fantasy books. If you like Eargon, then you will like this book because the character truly grows right before your eyes. Its fun to see the transformation from boy to man portrayed so well in a book. Please disreguard the poor reviews... As someone who has read a good bit of science fiction/fantasy genre, I can say that this is an above average presentation of a fantasy novel. The problem with too many fantasy novels is that it feels thin when it comes to character development and having a plot. Too many times it is very linear. You find yourself puzzling things out too soon and not really needing to read the rest of the book. I think the best authors lead you in one direction but give you suprises and misdirections later on. Even though Christopher is a young author, he does a much better job of trying to create a plot than R.A. Salvatore or Terry Brooks in my opinion. However, he has a long way to go before he can match Tolkien or George R.R. Martin. Both of these authors have extremely strong character development and very real emotional scenes played out. You are completely and 100% percent immersed in their worlds. Both of these authors make you think that you aren't reading a fantasy novel but something that could have happened in some other place. So when I compare Christopher's work versus his peers, I had to deduct one star. If Amazon allowed it, it would really need to be 3 1/2 stars. There were some scenes that I just didn't think were as powerfully written as they could have been. Also there were riduculous and distracting names such as Urgals (orcs), Murtag, Stronghammer, etc. I found myself saying that's a stupid name... Also, sometimes I felt that he had his character going to a place for no apparent reason. Or he would conveniently have a battle out of the blue to have a character killed off or another dissapear. I believe that Christopher's experience will help with his later works. But, he really needs to have better critiques and editing from his publisher and other advisors. Decent and a bit above average The first book was much better for i gave that a five star but you guys need to understand that the middle book in a trilogy is never quite as good as the rest because its main purpose is to lead the path to the third book... In the second book of a trilogy the main character often plays the role of a rookie and as you could imagine he loses more struggles then not... now i'd advise you to buy this book but not because it is absolutly spactacular or because the narrtive plot will blow your mind but merely to gain an understanding on the trilogy so later when the author releases the third book you will be able to fully enjoy its obvious five star matterial to come... there is something you guys got to understand... Book was received in excellent condition. I was really impressed! It was brand new, wrapped in clear wrap. I spent half of what the bookstore price was. My daughter has already finished reading it! I have recommended \"used books\" to several people who were suprised that it even exists. Thanks. Eldest book review Sure, the marketing hype is annoying and has probably led to this backlash. Let's not forget that this kid (I'm sorry 22 is still young) has tried to do something. If you don't like the book- fine, you are entitled to your opinion. But, some of the reviews here seem to attack the writer personally which is uncalled for and a little strange. Check the book out in the library if you are watching your pennies that carefully. This book isn't the greatest but it isn't the worst. It certainly shouldn't inspire this level of hatred towards the writer. It's as if Paolini ran over you all's dog or something. Take a deep breath and move on with your life- stop knocking someone who is trying to create something (no matter how imperfect the finished product is.) Hateful Reviews Modern day version of Lord of The Rings. Descriptive (but imaginative!) prose with dynamic characters and intriguing fantasy references. Brilliant, as well as impressive, epic written by somebody who's only in his early 20s! The movie does this book no justice! Can't wait for the 3rd and final installment. Fantasy Series Worth Reading This was a very good book. I thought it was much better than the first one. My son and I are dying to read the last book of the trilogy. Good read I like fantasy stories. I excepted a lot for Eldest.Unfortunately, story was stupid and characters weren't interesting. Still I read this book at the loose end. One of biggest disappoinment ever. Fantasy story. How could anyone say that Eldest was a bad book!!!!!! It's the best book I've ever read.I mean, if you liked Eragon, then there is only one reason to say that you didn't like Eldest, to argue.It took me two days to read this book. And the only time I stopped readding was when it changed from Eragon's adventure to Roran's. But then when I started reading Rorans, I couldn't stop.I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning on most nights reading it. And then I became depressed when I finished reading it. HOW DARE YOU!!!!!! On the plus side, I enjoyed reading both Eldest and Eragon. They are entertaining, reasonably fast paced, and with sufficient content to keep readers very engaged. The style varies from juvenile to the reasonably polished, and on the whole it is quite passable. I only wish he had resisted the temptation to write poetry, which is uniformly bad.On the minus side, his novels unapologetically borrow from others. I don't mean the usual derivative ideas where it is possible to excuse the ripping off as being vaguely flattering to the original. In the case of Mr. Paolini's novels there are so many points of similarity that, at times, if it were not for the fact that his sentences are less polished, you'd swear you were reading the original. The borrowing is so extensive that if you excluded the borrowed bits, there wouldn't be anything left. The only thing that appears to protect him from accusations of outright plagiarism is that he has had the \"inventiveness\" to borrow from many.To cite a few glaring examples:- The central theme of the books - the battle between good and evil, a protector turned evil who hunts down and destroys other protectors, the rebellion group, the farm boy with powers, and the relationship between the hero and a principal villain (albeit father in Star Wars and brother in Eldest) are all from Star Wars.- The elves, dwarves and Urgalls (similar to Orcs), the dwarves' and elves' homelands and the relationship between the elfish princess and the hero are all from Lord of the Rings.- The way in which magic is portrayed is eerily similar to The Wizard of Earthsea.- The relationship between dragons and humans, and the concept of dragon riders are almost direct rip-offs by the Anne McCaffrey novels.Borrowing ideas from other authors is not new. Most of Shakespeare's plays, for instance, borrowed heavily from great authors. However, most authors have the decency to acknowledge their use of such materials. Rarely have I come across a novel that uses so much from so many, with so little acknowledgement. Entertaining, but borders on plagiarism ... Many people have complained about this book being too descriptive, too boring, no action. It's too long! Seven hundred pages! Whatever shall we do? I've got news for you: Harry Potter's been longer and Lord of the Rings was much more descriptive, yet no one criticizes them so much. I read this book in less than two days.How is this book not original? The idea of the dragons and riders is original. The magic in this world is original. Eragon is nothing like Luke Skywalker, and Brom is not Gandalf. When did Luke have long and intense training? When was he maimed (the hand doesn't count, it didn't really affect the way he lived)? When did he not want to leave home? Sure, they were both the sons of the right-hand evil guys. But let's face it. Other than that, Eragon and Luke are completely different, and so are Star Wars and Inheritence.One last thing: EVERY LAST book or movie since J.R.R. Tolkien has used his idea for elves, so don't harp about it.I absolutely LOVE this book. It's definitely in my top ten. It's a great book for everyone, no matter their age. If you like magic and action, read it! Decide for yourself if you like it, and stop listening to bent-out-of-shape reviewers who really need to develop new ideas. What's the problem? I absolutely loved Eragon, and I was pretty pleased with this book as well. Granted, there were MANY dull parts to it, but all of the action completely made up for it. I especially loved the battle at the end of the book. Those three chapters or so were probably the best out of them all.[...] Great battle sequences I love the story and Mr. Paolini knows how to write a story. You can tell he has put a lot of work into this story too. I just couldn't put it down. I can't wait until the next book! Amazing Read!!! A+++ this book was fantasic, I actually have read it twice. The first time I had read eldest I lumped it in with dozens of other books that I had found to be merely pleasing. It was just recently after my second year of college that I have come to appreciate this book. I am actually in school now hoping someday to become an author. I am taking englishes classes, creative writing classes and a slew of other classes that make me relize just how complicated it can be. I think the biggest problem with the eragon series, is the fact that it is much more complex than most books.I think most people just have a hard time grasping all that is going on in this magical world. I have heard statememnts such as this book lacked emotion. I strongly disagree if anything the character development was overdone, again though sometimes you must rely on your memory to understand simple notes of irony that are scattered throughout the book. overall my consensus of this is that if you are looking for a simple book, stick to your Dr. Suess and other kindergarden level books, if not than go ahead and read this series. If this isn't your type of book simply do to the fact that you prefer non-fiction, or books of other nature's that is understandable. that is my opinion anyway, Hope you found it helpful not for simple minds Iloved it! I started the series only a couple weeks ago and I think that it's super awesome and I can't wait to read the last book Super cool! I got through the second book, Eldest, by skim reading and skipping whole paragraph's and pages. Too long, too verbose, with too little worth reading. But my major disappointment is similar to the reviews of many others: Paolini takes the ideas and themes of other authors so much, but adds very little original concept to the Genre. It lacks a convincing identity and character of is own to differentiate itself from much better works of fiction. But I gave it two stars because it did fill in two rainy days of vacation, and I am a sucker for adventure tales. Doesn't add more to the Genre than it copies If you have not read Eragon you should not read Eldest until you have read Eragon.Eldest has added more depth to Eragon, Ayra, Saphira and Roland. Also more characters are introduced to the story. Eragon finds another mentor and falls for another character. This book addresses the challenge Eragon faces in preparing for battle and rejection he faces in his love life. Saphira, his dragon, also faces the same challenges, which makes it more interesting. The battle and fighting, however, do not happen until the late part of the book (which I was fine with). Can't wait for the next one! Eldest is a great book about how Eragon and his dragon Saphira travel across Alagaesia. Their adventure takes them deep into dwarven tunnels and high in elven trees. Eragon has to learn magic in order to fight the only other dragon and rider in Alagaesia. He must look to the elves for help, but the elves may be hiding something from the rest of Alagaesia. While Eragon is in the elves' homeland, his cousin must fight off the Ra'zac and save the people of Carvahall by traveling to Surdia and their freedom! Two Thumbs Up! Eldest was a wonderful listen... I loved the voices of the characters. The plot had great twists, turns and surprises. I can't wait for the last one in the trilogy to be released. Awesome Eldest is the second book in the Inheritance Cycle. This series is a bestseller, and I can only guess why: because the author is so young? The first book, Eragon, showed promise considering the author's age. It was an interesting story despite being too long and having so many elements borrowed directly from classical fantasy novels. I decided that was just immaturity as a writer and gave the Eldest a go. The story itself is interesting: Eragon travels to the land of the Elves to learn how to be a dragon-rider. However, the writing style didn't mature any from the first book. Eldest dragged because it was 300 pages of plot in 800 pages of detail. And, as much as I tried, I simply didn't like Roran's character. So if you absolutely loved the first book, more power to you: this book is more of the same! If you liked Eragon's story, but found the execution lacking, this book is more of the same--with a little less of that new-story-gleam. More of the same I try to read most of the books my son reads so we have another subject to talk about. Most of the reviews discuss how this book \"rips\" off most other sci-fi/fantasy stories. I'm sorry to say that there are very few orginal stories; even Star Wars is just a fairy tale in another \"back-drop\". What is really important is how entertaining this story is, and it is!Young readers will really enjoy this book; it moves well with action and storyline flowing enough to retain interest and that \"can't put it down\" feeling that both my son and I got.There is certainly a \"Tolkien\" feel, but then so does \"Narnia\" and other creature tales.All in all we are eagerly anticipating the third book and the film in December.Christopher, don't listen to all those critics too closely, maybe they're just jealous!Good luck with all your literary adventures! It is what it is and my 12 year old son loves it! To all those people who feel Eldest didn't live up to its first book Eragon, I just want to say i think you're dead wrong. While I agree with the fact that Christopher did not need to tell us about every single lesson Eragon and Oromis had with one another, I feel that he wote about them for a reason. I feel the lessons we were told about will show up or become of some importance in the third Inheritence book. And I don't think by saying Paolini sort of stole ideas from Lord of the Rings is fair. All writers get their inspiration from books they read as a kid.DO NOT READ THE REST IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK, THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD.Now for my opinion of the book. I thought it was a very interesting, maybe a bit boring at times, book. It kept me reading, i kept asking myselfwhatisgonna happen to Roran and the village?, Oh no Katrina's been taken!, and my jaw dropped when I got to the part where Oromis and Glaedr were revealed to us. I alsolove the family relations Eragon has with Morzan and Murtagh. GENIUS! It just gives the story that much more of a twist. And it will, in my opinion, bring a lot of emotion and depth to the third Inhertence book. I am also curious to see how Roran will free Katrina, if he does that is. Sloan turining traitor to his own people and daughter was unexpected, I mean you knew he was upset but not upset enough to put Katrina in danger.Overall Eldest was what I expected it to be and more. I cannotwait for the third and final installment to Inheritence and I hope Paolini writes more books after he is finished with the Inheritence trilogy.KEEP WRITNG CHRIS! You have more fans than you do haters. Contradiction Sorry I am just not impressed. The writing is that of a child of whom the author is. To compare his book to that of the Lord of the Rings is an insult. No imagination, or originality. Go ahead and read it if you want something that mimics other books. I however would rather read something original. Not Impressed How far would you go to save the one(s) you love?Author Christopher Paolini utilizes book two in his Inheritance trilogy to focus on the many facets of that emotion through Eragon, his dragon, Saphira, and his cousin, Roran.Eragon matures greatly under more rigid instruction from Oromis - a Dragon Rider - and also struggles with his strong feelings for Arya, the daughter of an Elven queen, that are not reciprocated because the love is destined to never happen. But Eragon cannot simply let his emotions die.Saphira - Eragon's dragon - is also tutored to become wiser & stronger by the dragon Glaedr. Saphira thought she would never meet another dragon and her destiny was to be the final survivor. Saphira's love for Glaedr is also rejected seemingly due to what the future holds for her.With Roran, it is a case of betrayal, as the father of his bride-to-be - Katrina - assists the evil Ra'zac & Imperial soldiers in kidnapping her so the wedding he does not approve of will not take place. Roran is left with his village in ruins and thrusted into a leadership role that balances the survival of his friends & neighbors to his plans of rescuing Katrina.Also woven into the story are the emotions associated with hate, revenge & death and the controveries surrounding leadership during stressful times. While the section concerning Eragon's continuing education seems much too long, Paolini may be playing a game with the reader; the feelings stated by Eragon - like those of the reader - are those of eagnerness & anticipation, which are tempered by his frustrations & errors.There are also scenes that seem too familiar from the first book. Again, Paolini may be attempting to convey how the character's perceptions have changed with the maturation process, even in settings that were seemingly well-known.Though it can be (successfully) argued that Eldest would have had a tighter story through better editing, Paolini has done an admirable job in building up the main characters and setting the stage to bring everything to an excellent conclusion in the final book of the trilogy. The Maturation Of Understanding The Emotion Of Love I chose this review because the book was written perfectly. It shows suspense to make you keep reading for hours. Also it has an interesting view on magic and how the characters us it. Review i would rate this book 10 stars if i could! This book briliantly weaves the first novel, Eragon, with the new fantastic book, Eldest. Marvelous! the descriptions are great and the plot even better! shows many fealing such as pain, anxiety, happiness, and love. Definately my most favorate book ever! people must be crazy not too absoluteky adore this book. by the way the person who gave this book a one star is phsyco and needs too go through therapy. AWSOME! Any real criticism of Eragon and Eldest seems to magically disappear. How does that happen? Why does that happen? How many reviews from real people never got posted in the first place? Is it designed to make us think people love these books? Well it's not working, the word is out: Eragon and Eldest SUCK!! Eragon had laughably bad writing and if it were possible the writing in Eldest is even worse. Awful doesn't begin to cover it Like Eragon, this is also an entertaining read and a page turner. I think Paolini did a fine job, especially since the middle book of a trilogy can be tough. Yes, as countless other posts note, you can pick out elements of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in the plot lines. So what, you can find the elements from The Seven Samurai in the The Magnificent Seven, that does not diminish either work. The one thing I did notice is that Paolini seemed to break out the thesarus a bit too often. There were times when his word choice seemed forced and odd, which jarred me out of the narrative. Good Sophmore Effort Pleased with the book condition and the read. Passed the book on to my sister for her enjoyment. Eldest Even though we've read the books (Eragon & Eldest) our family enjoys listening to the stories on long rides. (We already own the first book and CD in the series.) The narrator does an excellent job of relating the story. The only thing I'd change would be to give Saphira a more feminine and less gravely voice. Now, if we could only find out when the next book in the series will be published! Really enjoying this book, can't wait for the 3rd one... When i first began this book I thought it to be just ok. Many surprises unraval during the course of the book. In my opinion Christopher Poalini is getting to be even better then J.K. Rowling. This book can be enjoyed by all ages but in order to understand it you need to read Eragon which is another exellent book. Go Christopher Poalini!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have read several harsh critics about the book and can't quite comprehend them as I found this sequel as good, if not better, than Eragon. Having the stories of 2 main characters, and a few minor ones, cross and converge toward the grand epic of the final chapter is an excellent way to underline the various forces at work and gives more credibility to the story as it is obvious that one character alone, as strong as he could be, would not be enough to defeat the emperor. And whoever has any normal reading skills won't get lost trying to follow the parallel stories as I have read somewhere.I have seen Star Wars, read Lord of the Rings and Ann Mc Caffrey's books and all the critics about how the book draws from them seem unfair to me. Of course it is a story of good against evil, an initiatic journey in which a yound nondescript boy grows to manhood and has to decide who and what he'll become and it brings back dwarves and dragons that appear in other stories, but the style, descriptions, characters are fresh and gripping and I could not put the book down. If the fact that Murtagh is Eragon's brother came as no surprise (this is quite easily deducted from the dialogs in the first book), it did not lessen the thrill of the clash between the brothers and I, personnally, can't wait for the last book in the trilogy to come out to figure out who might defeat the emperor, and how. A wonderful book for anybody who has an open mind and does not spend his time trying to find a specific line or another that might resemble what was written elsewhere. an excellent book If I had known what a rip off this book was I would have never paid one red cent for it. Besides being very very very bad, the writing is terribly dull and incredibly boring. He spends too much time running off about nothing and so little time writing about anything interesting. Too many paragraphs and pages were redundant and should have been excluded.This once again proves correctly the saying of PT Barnum, \"There's a sucker born every minute\" and unfortunately I was one of them to believe that this would be anywhere close to good. If you spend your money on this book, you will likely want it back after you read it. If you have this book do the public a favor and donate it to your local library so that others see what a rip-off this book really is. ONE STAR IS TOO GENEROUS I really enjoyed this book, but I do think book one was more exciting.Book one has a new fantasy concept with a boy finding a dragon egg and tying a bond with the hatched dragon that is very deep. There is also a lot of activity going on, adventures and such.In book number 2, the saga continues, but much time is spent on the education of Eragon, and exactly what happens when the elf's teach him to become a rider as well as politics between the different races rather than pure adventures. Although this is part of the story, I think too much time and effort is dedicated to this aspect. Other than that, it is a great book, with a great continuation from book 1.I am eagerly awaiting to read the last book in this series!!This is a book that is fit for adults as well as kids! Good fantasy - but book one was a 5 star I thought this book was an excellent read. The plot was a little slow but I thought the pace was necessary. It seemed to me that the point of the book was to explain the characters and situation. Eldest was an information book much like Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. I see this book as setting up the events of book three. As for Paolini \"plagiarizing\", I have yet to read a totally original fantasy book. George Lucas, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander ect. all borrow heavily from other sources (mainly myth). Star Wars is based off of the King Arthur legend. Tolkien based the Lord of the Rings off a German/Norse myth called The Curse of the Ring (Yes it's true. Look it up if you don't believe me.) Lewis based The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe off the life and death of Jesus. The Prydian Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander are Welsh myths retold in children's books. Also, Harry Potter has many myths woven into it. Many fan sites list the comparasons between Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. As for the love scenes, my friends and I have had many juvenile awkward experiences with love. It's part of growing up. I think Paolini did a wonderful job and I can not wait to read the next book! A Great Read This was the best second of a serries book that I have ever read. I enjoy the challlenging words and the excellent word choice and sentance fluency. I thought the book was awesome.From Emily, an happy reader. Best Of The Best (That a second book can be.) I loved it. The first of words were a bit boring but it started to get much better. Again, I loved it. Cool I never write reviews. No, really. I'm the type that likes to leech off other reviews and then make decisions on whether or not I should read the book. But when I read Eragon, I had the awful luck of reading before consulting any of the other reviews. Sure, the first few chapters seemed okay. Some battles, blood, a damsel in distress kidnapped--the usual. And the dragon part was cool (I hadn't read Dragonriders of Pen or whatever) But imagine my growing horror as I realized that this book was a RIP-OFF. I watched only ONE Star Wars movie (some attack of the clones or something) and even with that one measly experience i knew that this book was not a story written with care and creativity. It was a clean-cut example of plagurism. The first word \"Eragon\" ticked me off. I rubbed my eyes and checked to see if it really was Eragon and not Aragorn. Let's forget about the name, I concluded.But it only got worse.Needless to say, I finished the book (because I rarely leave books unfinished) and thought of submitting a letter of complaint to the library about removing the book.Now that was Eragon. Where to start with Eldest? I didn't finish the book. I got to the part with all that training and decided to fling the book across the room. Really, I'm a forgiving person. I can forgive the mundane storyline, the snobby vocabulary, the cardboard characters, and how the story is just BORING. But I can't forgive the author's stuck-up attitude. I was planning on pushing this book and its author out of my life when I had to see that interview during which Paolini pretty much claims (with a smug smile) that his writing achieves \"Tolkien at his best.\" Poor Mr. Tolkien. Compared to a teenage writer who got his book published with his mom and dad at the back to support him. Compared to a stuck-up boy who thinks his book can top any fantasy novel. I hope Mr. Tolkien isn't rolling in his grave.Now, my conclusion (note the wonderful transition): my warning is to kids like me. I'm going to turn 14 soon (good-bye blissufl childhood years) and to you kids who are under or near my age, stop your word-vomit about how wonderful this pitiful excuse of a book is. Read the REAL fantasy novels like Tolkien, Rowling, and all the other unread but great writers. Read this book only when you're in the mood to laugh at someone (which I did with Eldest). beyond hideous FINIRAELThis is a brilliant book, (written by a brilliant author), that is filled with fantasy and imagination. For all fiction-book readers, I highly recommend Eldest. The story was so well written, that I could feel what the characters felt, I could relate to the hardships and struggles, and best of all, the victories. I have read countless books, and of all fantasy books, Eldest is my favorite. This book will appeal to all readers; it has action and adventure, romance and warfare. Eldest will also keep you interested with a diversity of imaginative dialect, which Mr. Paolini has created. This wonderful piece of literature will keep you up all night wanting to read more! Many reviewers have rated this book too harshly, (and based on their comments, they obviously didn't read the whole book, or they disagreed with one of the points Christopher Paolini emphasized). Potential buyers who are reading this review, should take notice that most other reviewers do not state WHY they do not like the book, just simply that they don't like it, while I am giving valid and descriptive reasons. Do not rely solely on the majority of reviews, because they were too critical. I cannot emphasize enough what a great book this is and I hope that you will read it. Eldest deserves more! I never took the time to read the reviews on this book before buying it and a very good thing that I hadn't. The reviews that make the title page of this book act as if it were reduced to a kindergarten level of thought. In one aspect of their reviews, they are right. This book is a lot more slow-paced than Eragon was. However, in this book the studies, so fondly treated as meaningless drivel in reviews past, are a way of understanding the very nature of what Eragon has inherited as a rider, and gives us a true sense of what is expected of him. Eldest also serves to show us the social influences and customs of the Elves, as where in Eragon we were showed the Dwarves and the Human sides of life. It also serves to show us answers to questions we harbored from the first book of this trilogy, as well as to set plots up to coincide with the upcoming, final book of the trilogy. In short do not expect a face-paced race-for-your-life book, but a calmer side of things, and explanations of details from the first book of this trilogy. Slow-paced This book tells a great story, but some of the chapters are too immersed in details and slow to read. I prefer more action and less description of the settings. Even w/ these negative comments, I can't wait for the last book in this series to be published. It is an intriguing storyline - the interaction between characters makes the story move quickly. Enjoy!! Eldest I began reading Eldest quickly, only bothering with interesting portions, laughing outright at foolishly written sections, and sometimes flipping through eight to ten pages - sometimes more - without more than a glance. Then, as Eragon commenced his training in the Elven kingdom, my attention became considerably more rapt.While young Paolini has showed his immaturity in the many - and none of them are easily ignored - paralells between his text and the works of similar, but greater, authors, Eldest gradually gained an identity of its own. The ... defeat that his character is forced to suffer through is believable and convincing. Paolini's own views begin to shine through the pages in a more \"prismish\" fashion, instead of just an occasional, childish burst between scenes of blood and cantankerous stupidity. There is a prevading sense of EFFORT in the pages, effort made by the young Rider and his dragon, and, most noticeably, effort unheedingly poured into them by the author. Paolini gets my respect for that.Thanks to the use of elves, Paolini is able to expand the bounds of Eragon's thinking; a nice, fresh breath from the previous ignorance that prevaded the character. The alliances forged, the humanity of words, and thoughts, etc. It was good, and done with some level of natural feeling.This is...worth reading. Surprisingly Impressive - This required honest EFFORT As an adult I realize that my years may put me beyond the age of the target audience. So let me say that if the reader is around 12 then the rating is 3 stars because its faults would not be so obvious to the inexperienced. I would give the book 1 star if the reader is over 18.When reading the first book, \"Eragon\" it was not hard to notice the lack of experience of the author. However, his youthful enthusiasm and his desire to please pulled me through the story. Sadly in the second book, \"Eldest\", the writing has not gotten better, it has gotten much worse. Some of the dialog between Eragon and Arya is as cringe inducing as the love scenes in the more recent Star Wars movies. The elves are drawn from Tolkien I assume, but they are so blandly drawn that I never felt a desire to walk among them as I did with their cousins in Middle Earth. I could complain about the unoriginality of many of the plot elements or the heavy handed moralizing but I don't think these are the book's greatest flaws.The greatest flaw is this: Good fantasy books are not about the author's ability to tell a fantastic tale as much as his ability to make the reader feel the wonder of his fantasy. Paolini obviously has been much time and thought into his fantasy world filling it with lots of details. However he never realizes that the elaborate physical descriptions and carefully worked out plots and sub-plots are mere devices to feed the fire of a reader's imagination. If the story teller's skill can not ignite the spark, they are just a big pile of words.I do have one question for Mr. Paolini: You called your Elves \"Elves\" and your Dwarves \"Dwarves\", so why did you call your Orcs \"Urgals\"? A step back for the series This book is truly unfortunate -- for the obvious reasons already listed. But I think the anger is misdirected. What young person is not full of themselves at this age? Every waking thought seems fresh and profound. (Remember the poetry writing stage many of us went through in our teens?) What this kid needed was honest critique and some real guidance for his undeniable energy and talent. For that, his editor and publishing house completely failed him. After all, they're supposed to be the professionals. Instead of mentorship, they cynically pushed product out the door, contemptuous of readers [...] This young talent was not well served by his publisher. This book was laughably bad. It was boring as hell, but it sucked to the point that I found myself laughing outloud at some of the antics that Paolini tries to pull.And don't get me wrong--I am not one of those Eragon-haters that's just out to write bad reviews. Honestly, I thought that Eragon was an okay book, nothing great, but okay. On the surface level, I even found it enjoyable. But Eldest was HORRIBLE!!! I am well-read in fantasy and happen to be a fan of Star Wars, so the continued contrivances in Eldest (not to mention the more blatant ones in Eragon) were just too much for me to take.The writing was just bad. The description was sometimes ridiculously overwrought, and of course, I laughed. The only time that the description was good was when Paolini described something from LOTR, like Lothlorien, wait, I mean Ellesmera. If I were Paolini's editor, I would be ASHAMED to have let this piece of crap go on to publication. Just because Eragon was so popular doesn't mean that Paolini is allowed to get away with murder, actually plagerism, as well as just bloated bad writing and an empty bloated plot, and worthless plot-device characters. The whole book was just a waste of time. I hate myself for spending money on it. I had actually thought that Paolini might improve in his writing, but the joke's on me this time. I laughed anyway.But I haven't even gotten to the dialogue yet. Now THAT was funny. How much more unrealistic can you get? I have never heard anyone talk in the manner that the people in the book talk. Like the script to a C action movie. It sucks! And through the dialogue, it was impossible to discern between characters, just because it had no life and no distinction whatsoever. All of the characters started to become the same in my head, kind of like all the unnecessary characters in the later Wheel of Time books. But both the dialogue (I mean the C-movie script) and the cahracters that recite it are awful. I wanted Eragon to die by the end. Same with all the other characters.And I mustn't forget AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! AYE! If you guys think that's annoying, then you are in for a surprise. The painfully irritating repetion of the word 'aye' in place of 'yes' was kind of funny in a pathetic way at first, but after the hundreth time, it's not really that funny anymore, and you will want to throw the book out the window or perform some other passive-aggressive act upon it.And vegetarianism becomes one giant ongoing joke within this book. I don't think I can ever take a vegetarian seriously again. This is just philosophy that is so dumb that it's just intrinsically funny.I'll stop now, or else ... or else....I don't know. And more importantly, I DON'T CARE! Absolutely hilarious - - But in a really BAD way I enjoyed Eragon but could barely put Eldest down. Paolini is an amazing author and writes so that his characters and landscapes come to life in a vivid and exciting way! A wonderful sequel... can't wait for the third book. An artfully written adventure! Ok.I'm like a really big fan of the Eragon books. I mean, I cried when I got hold of Eldest. When I started this book, I kind of had this vibe in the beginning that told me that this book isn't going to be as good as the first book, Eragon. Now, Eragon rocked. It was really good. When I finished Eldest, I knew that Paolini tried to improve his writing, try to hold the suspence, but man did he mess it up!! He did add some surprises in the end so that's why this book didn't get a 1 star from me. But, in the beginning and middle, Paolini made the chapters so dragging and boring that I seriously wanted to skip like five chapters to the end. If I wasn't such a big fan of the Eragon books, you wouldn't be reading this review. My suggestions to you is to borrow Elest from the library and save your freaking time on this book. PLEASE. You don't want to be as frustrated as I was. Not so good, not so bad I will give Christopher Paolini this: he has certainly improved as a writer. Eldest gives Paolini an opportunity flesh out his characters in a way that was missing from the first novel, Eragon. The characters of Eragon and Saphira are much three dimensional and Paolini has also developed many of the supporting players into interesting characters. Among those who've turned out to be quite interesting is Arya and Roran, who really step to the front and change in ways we didn't expect. Nasuada, the newly chosen leader of Varden, is also one that has grown and changed over the course of the two novels. Paolini also deserves credit for better distinguishing his fantasy world from that of similar novels. Of course, my review is based on listening to the novel as narrated by Gerard Doyle. Once again, Doyle makes the story come alive with wonderful vocal characterizations and reading voice easily listened to. I'll give Paolini points from making a marked improvement between Eragon and Eldest. If it continues, the final novel should be quite good. A Definate Improvement I was disappointed by \"Eldest.\" Eragon had enough in it to make me hope for more. Despite all of the plot points and story elements that Paolini took from other authors, I enjoyed Eragon because it appeared that Paolini was trying to be fresh. Eldest did not live up to my hope that the story would get more original. It was tedious and this time, all of the material being borrowed became a problem. So much of the story has already been told by others, I found myself predicting much of what was going to happen long before the author got to the point in the story. I don't like to write a POTENTIAL SPOILER and I am not sure that this even is one, but how many people caught the \"old line of kings\" and \"Palancar Valley\" that he threw in. I suspect that we will find out that Roran is able to do what he does in Eldest as he is descended from this old royal line that once ruled (being cousins, Eragon may or may not also have this \"old royal blood\") who knows. Overall, I was disappointed in the story-telling and how uneven it was. The worst part was the inclusion of the line about the \"stinking barges\" almost made me shut the book once and for all. I don't know if Paolini thought it would be funny or what, but it completely ruined any remaining connection I had to the world he had created.I wish that the author had made more progress into a story of his own. Instead we find ourselves covering ground which other authors have already covered, and covered in a much better fashion. Not very good That's how the book reads - an unedited manuscript written by, well, a kid. The more I read of this book, the more I realize how much Eragon must have been edited. That book at least flowed somewhat nicely. This one is a bloated mess of huge and unecessary words and descriptions.And of course, the stolen elements. The plot of Star Wars with characters from LotR! How original! Not 5 pages in and I was already fuming at this boy's audacity - Nasuada, clone of Eowyn disobeyed her father and stayed to fight! So naturally, her father Ajihad (Theoden) DIES! Poor Tolkien must be spinning in his grave.I honestly don't know if I will be able to finish this book. And this is coming from someone who got through Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell! But Jonanthan Strange had subtle humor and dry witticisms - Eldest only has stale plots and cardboard characters.I don't understand why anyone would think it's okay to steal plots, characters, even lines. This completely unacceptable in the visual arts world. I am an artist, but if people saw me copying da Vinci's or Michaelangelo's artworks I'd be drawn and quartered! It's just not right!I'm amazed that the author has learned nothing from the criticims and continues to make the exact same mistakes. I'm also amazed that he's actually pretentious enough to compare himself to the likes of Tolkein and Beowulf. You're supposed to leave others to make such comparisons, doing it yourself makes you look extremely ostentatious. I might have given it 2 stars (after all he tried... I think) but that comment knocked a star off for me. Didn't ANYONE edit this book?? I liked this book except for a few things:1. The fact that eragon's side of the story is boring for the first half of the book anyway.2. Everyone keeps saying \"aye\"3. It has some wierd scenes4. The characters seem to overeact sometimes5. Resembles Star Wars, but less than in Eragon6. Eragon and Arya*thier scenes seem rather fake. Good book I guess Love the Brisinger books. Plus, you can't beat Amazon's price and the free shipping! Love it! After reading some of the reviews for Eldest I'm beginning to wonder if this was supposed to be published on April 1 as an april fool's joke. This book reads like an april fool's joke what with the characters being pulled around like puppets and talking like they dropped in from cartoonland.I find it hard to believe any honest to goodness person read and liked Eldest. After rolling my eyes the umpteenth time at this stupipdity of the characters, I gave up. I couldn't even get my kids to read it. In a way, I'm glad my kids didn't read it. No good parent would let their kids read a book where characters are so lacking in values. Horrible doesn't begin to describe it Eldest is even better tha the first book of the \"Inheritance\" trilogy, \"Eragon\". Mr Paolini takes us on a fantastic adventure through his world of magic, myth, and legend. A fine addition to your library. Eldest by Christopher Paolini I was so glad to find the second book in this series at an acceptable price. The story and reading are wonderful! Love This Series Love it. Left me wanting the third book in this series. Will read again as soon as I get the third book. Will cotinue to read over and over. Great, Leaves You Wanting More I read Eragon on a lark and then became hooked. I keep reminding myself that this complex, creative and infinitely engrossing book was written by a teenager.For any one who loved Tolkien's ring trilogy and for adults who loved reading Harry Potter, Eragon and Eldest are must reads! Paolini is an amazing young talent I was so captivated by this extraordinary read, that, although it is 668 pages long, I read it in a week. At many points in the story, I was so engrossed within it that I found it difficult to put it down. This is a marvelous book, and I think that nearly anyone who reads it will love it. This book contains many more surprises than its prequel Eragon, and you will constantly find yourself reading it with your mouth gaping open. Truly, I am uncertain how anyone could not adore this book. To anyone who has not read this or its prequel Eragon, I recommend you do so immediately! This book is well worth the price! A Great Addition to the Inheritance Trilogy I have read many reviews on Eldest, the second volume in the Inheritance Trilogy by Christopher Paolini. Some truly adored it, saying it was an excellent book. Others spat on it, hating every part of the book from cover to cover. However, it is time for me to submit my opinion on this novel.Eragon, once a lowly farmer from Carvahall, has elevated his status to new heights. Traveling through the mythical land of Alagasia, he makes many friends and enemies. At the beginning of Eldest, Eragon is in Farthen Dr after a harrowing battle with the Urgals and the Shade called Durza, and has sustained a nasty wound. He and his dragon Saphira go to Ellesm&eacute;ra, the city of the elves, with Orik the dwarf and Arya the elf. Eragon trains under Oromis and Glaedr, two Dragon Riders from years past. Meanwhile, his brother Roran fights to save Carvahall from the sinister Ra'zac. After lots of training necessary to become a Rider, he goes to Surda, the only place that has dared to defy the cruel King Galbatorix. Meeting up with the rest of the Varden (a rebel movement) and his brother, Eragon fights a terrible battle by the Jiet River--and learns a terrible secret...From my detailed explanation of this book, you can probably guess I liked it. Some parts were a little slow, but overall it was a wonderful thing to read. I highly recommend it to anyone who desires a tale of fantasy with a dash of science fiction and a whole lot of things you can't pronounce! Super book. READ IT! I read the first book in the inheritance series and (unlike the movie which completely ruined the story) loved it. I got Eldest as a christmas present from my brother yesterday. I finished it last night (stayed up till 3:00 in the morning reading it..heh). It was interesting, but in my opinion the parts about Nasuada could've been written a little better to grab your interest. Also hen it went to Rorans story, it dragged on a bit, like what should've been said in a page or 2, went into such great detail that it ended up 3 or 4 pages. Don't get me wrong, I loved that the writer decided to switch back and forth between Eragon and Roran. There were only a few incidents such as this though. Overall, it was a really good book, although it did the whole second not as good as the first thing. I hope the third is as good as the first two, and i can't wait for it to come out! good, but the first will probably always be the best in the series My whole family like to listen to books on CD while in the car. This was a great book. Great Eldest, second book of the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini, is a very worthwhile and entertaining book.This book has been recommended to readers worldwide, and I for one have thoroughly enjoyed it. The action is non-stop and fast-paced. This is one of those books that you can't stop reading until midnight (or later).Here are a few of the best points of this book:1. Many fantasy books have you so confused by the fifth page that you stop, but this is not one of them. Paolini does a great job explaining the storyline as it goes along. The dictionary of the ancient/dwarvish/urgal languages was also very helpful. Many authors use these languages and leave the reader to find out what these words mean by themselves. This often leads to mass confusion throughout the book.2. Paolini also creates a great storyline for this book. I mean how many books have you heard of where people are bonding with dragons? And when have dragons ever been the good guys? The storyline is very original and all of this happens in Eldest.3. In all of his creativity, Paolini also creates some very original characters. For example: the urgals, shades, in addition to your usual elves, dwarves, and humans. He also gives these characters different personalities and languages.4. Paolini's work is also beneficial in an educational way. Many high school and junior high reading lists include Eldest and Eragon (Inheritance book 1). Schools only use the best of modern literature in their reading lists; proving once again, that this is a great book.Inheritance already rivals the popularity of Lord of the Rings. In a few years, it will undoubtedly surpass Lord of the Rings, and 30 years from now no one will remember Lord of the Rings but instead, Paolini's Inheritance. A GREAT READ! Eldest is the second book in Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, which began with Eragon. In this book, Eragon sets out to learn all he can from the elves about how to be rider, while trying to forget the distraction that is his love for Arya. Nasuada takes control of the Varden and struggles to discover the best way to resist the Empire. Roran is attacked at Caravahall and must decide how to save himself and his village. Meanwhile, Galbatorix and his followers are growing in strength, and Eragon is running out of time to learn everything he must know.Rating: 5/5Alright, so this book is basically just Eragon learning a bunch of things. 80% of the book is spent with Eragon getting training from Oromis. However, the things he learns are really interesting. Plus, Eragon's chapters are interspersed with chapters from the points of view of Nasuada and Roran, both of which were surprisingly intriguing. I didn't think I wanted to read about what they were doing, but Paolini kept it interesting and engaging. The book offered a lot of new information about the universe and its characters, making it a solid second installment.Okay, on to the *SPOILERS*!The theme of this book seemed to be overcoming difficulties. Nasuada has to deal with her father's death and her new leadership, and her chapters were a tad boring, but insightful. We got to see her being a leader, which I liked, and her chapters offered more on the girl Eragon blessed in the first book. However, she was forgotten by the time the battle rolled around. Eragon better take that curse off her in the next book.Roran deals with a lot of adversity. First there's just the issue that he wants to marry Katrina and he's convinced her father won't allow it. Then, of course, he has to take leadership of the entire village and bring them to Surda. I least looked forward to Roran's chapters, but they actually were quite interesting. Roran also faces an injury in his shoulder, but most importantly he has to deal with extremely difficult situations. Roran learns to kill without a second thought, but he never forgets the number of men he's killed. He has become a leader, and he realizes the costs. Roran, I think, has the hardest road.Then there's Eragon. Poor little Eragon. Honestly, he was pretty annoying in this book (not that he wasn't annoying in the first book too). He complained about his back CONSTANTLY. I get that it's painful, but really, just shut up. Anyway, Eragon also faces the pressures of learning what it takes to be a rider and a leader, and he knows that he will one day fight Galbatorix head on. Then there's his unrequited love for Arya, which kills me. Just love him, why don't you! He's so in love with her, and I think it's adorable.Another theme is family, which Eragon himself actually points out in the ending there. Paolini uses brothers more than anything, obviously. For the entirety of the novel we're getting Eragon juxtaposed with Roran. They both have physical pains plaguing them, they're both learning how to be leaders, and they're both trying to get love in their own ways. However, Roran deals with his problems head on in this book. He's forced to kill much more than Eragon is, and Roran has his shoulder pain up until the end. Eragon, on the other hand, spends most of the book learning and not fighting, and his pain is taken away by the dragons.Eragon's problems are solved with magic, while Roran must solve his with cunning and strength. I'm not saying that Eragon isn't also cunning and strong, but it's a different kind of power. Eragon has passed into supernatural territory; Roran represents strength in the human world.Then there's the revelation at the end, and I think the ending totally made the whole book worth it. I know I should have seen it coming that Morzan is Eragon's father, but I totally didn't. Of course, Eragon decides that Garrow (and even Brom and Oromis) is his father, really. I'm not so interested in the patronage, anyway. Morzan's dead.I'm interested in the fraternity! Murtagh is Eragon's brother. How awesome is that. So now we get Eragon juxtaposed against Murtagh, and of course, the major differences in the two is circumstance. Eragon was raised by Garrow. He never knew Morzan. He was taken into Brom's care, and then into the elves's. He knew right from wrong from a young age, and he had a loving childhood. He receives training that teaches him the correct way of the world and allows him to grow as a person, a leader, and a rider.Murtagh was raised by Morzan, who was cruel and abusive. He's grown up despised by everyone because of his heritage. Then, he's forced into servitude by Galbatorix and taught magic that should never be used.Here is the clear difference between the two characters. We see that Eragon very easily could have been Murtagh, and vice versa. It's their environment and the people they are influenced by that affect them, and that's what makes the differences. I'm hoping that Murtagh will be able to escape Galbatorix's power and become a true brother to Eragon. We'll see.The book also addressed the question of why we live, and for that topic I'll leave you with a few quotes:\"Whether fate and destiny really exist, the only thing I can do is enjoy the present and live as honorably as possible.\"\"Life is both pain and pleasure. If this is the price you must pay for the hours you enjoy, is it too much?\"\"Things that change and are lost, that is what's worth preserving.\"I also found interesting the passage of Glaedr telling Eragon and Saphira that Galbatorix relationship with his dragon is a \"depraved imitation\" of their relationship. I think that will be explored further in the next two books.Well, I'm off to read Brisingr. I am really enjoying this series. Intriguing novel, but not for everyone I only wanted to add my stars to the low average this breath taking series of books so rightfully deserves. This book is one of two and both a couple of my favorites... Beautiful I was shocked and in disbelief when our local paper reviewed Eldest and gave it its \"lowest rating ever\" F-. Previously I had thought that Entertainment Weekly's D+ rating was harsh but F-?Imagine my outrage when those reviews turned out to be not harsh enough. This book is really awful. Was this book rushed to print? Was any editing done? I can't for the life of me imagine it was. AWFUL I bought this book for my 11 year old son. He had already read the first book. He finished this one in 2 days. He is even urging me to read it! I'm giving this 5 stars because although my son likes to read I don't recall him ever finishing a book this big in such a short time EVER! It even took him longer to read the last Harry Potter book! Great job Mr. Paolini:) ELdest (Inheritance, Book 2) I voractiously read and perhaps the timing was just \"right\" for me to pick up both Eragon and Eldest over the past week. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the story in Eragon and eagerly picked up Eldest to continue the ride.Unfortunately, I think that Eldest fails it's predecessor by spending too much time in alternate storylines which pale to the central storyline of Eragon and Saphira. I found the Roran plotline exceedingly plodding - to the point of actually skipping chapters to get back to Eragon and Saphira.Perhaps book 3 of the trilogy will round the series out and clean up the entirely too loose ends of Eldest, but I feel that maturity and experience of the author are what's holding him back. Clearly a great start to a career, but by no means would I compare him or these works to Tolkien or Asimov. Entertaining but no classic I really enjoy this series. I can't wait to read the finale. The text is a bit wordy but the fantasy and story is real bliss. I just love the world and characters he has created. Not as easy to read as Harry Potter but worth the effort. ENJOYING TO THE FULLEST! Chiristopher Paolini has done it again. He has continued to keep us on the edge of our seats in the continuing saga of Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed how he encorporated his cousin into the book as well. Can hardly wait for the third of the Trilogy to come out. Magnificant Fantasy THIS IS A GOOD FOLLOW-UP TO THE FIRST BOOK ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE STORY MOVE AHEAD A LITTLE FASTER. ALL IN ALL A GOOD FANTASY READ AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW HE MOVES THE STORY TO IT'S CONCLUSION. THE STORY CONTINUES... I enjoyed reading Eldest more than its predecessor. Most of the aspects of the first book that I did not enjoy was rectified in the second one. The characters in Eragon were similar to puddles of mud. However, in Eldest, I was pleased to see that most of the characters (with the exception of Arya) had reasonable and engaging personalities .Saphira evolved from being a boring and bland character into a creature with great passions . I felt that I was experiencing the true majesty of a dragon. She actually faces her own inner demons and problems like other characters and grows from them. So very unlike the first one where she didn't seem like much of a character at all.Eragon has also went through the same change. In the first book ,he was very unrealistic. In this book, he questions his own beliefs and his humanity. This causes him to evolve into a strong character. He suffers from a great disability in which the scar that the shade inflicted upon him causes him much pain. He must learn to overcome his own human weakness. He also learns that, in his ignorance, he made brutal and inadvertent mistakes that harmed the people around him.The book's plot had me reading non-stop. The training that Eragon and Saphira go through is enjoyable to read. There are many semblances to their training in which Eragon must test not only his strength but his wisdom and intellect. Saphira had to learn how to be a true dragon and qualm her feral desires.The Elvish land of Du Weldenvarden was described so well that I felt like I was in that forest civilization. I enjoyed seeing the elves' culture. Paolini skims through the dwarven culture but he gives great detail on the Elvish one. It was very refreshing to see the elves portrayed almost like faeries of Celtic lore. I was very afraid that the elves were going to be Vulcan like and emotionless like Arya. However, they turned out to be such a likable race. I look forward to visiting Du Weldenvarden in future books.I enjoyed how the book focused on Roran and Eragon. Every few chapters would switch between the two. I always wondered what became or would become of the villagers in Carvahall and it was amazing to see it through Roran's eyes. Though the switching would throw the book off every once in a while but it wasn't common.Nasuada also had chapters focusing on herself in the book. It was not as much as Roran and Eragon but it did give some insight on what the Varden were planning to stop Galbatorix. It also showed what became of the child that was blessed by Eragon.Though I liked the book a lot I did have some gripes with it. It has its own flaws that does not agree with me. For instance, I did not enjoy Eragon becoming extremely powerful in a short amount of time. Those that read the book would understand what I am talking about. It kind of made the whole training (though enjoyable) entirely pointless. It also cheats Eragon of overcoming his disability as well.I also did not like the character, Arya, she seems very flat. I understand that Paolini is trying to make her into a strong, silent female character. However, having her hide her emotions and act like an automaton does not sit well with me as the reader. It makes her very unrealistic, unlikable, and I found myself hoping she would get a sword cleaved through her just to spare me her blandness. She acts like she knows everything and acts like an uptight and arrogant person.Paolini pulls off having strong alien characters through the Elven queen and through most of the elves in Du Weldenvarden. I saw the queen as a very likable character though we do not see her as much as Arya. The queen is also a strong female character along with Nasuada. Arya fails at that and I find her to be a very unneeded character. The romance between Eragon and Arya are awkward and staged at best. I feel no connection between the two characters.A small gripe that I had with the book was that you did not see much of Saphira's training. I really wanted to see that but you only get quick glimpses of it through Eragon's connection with her. There are also two new characters that I kind of liked but didn't like at the same time. Their personalities are also non-existent. Eragon and Saphira's trainers though very mysterious suffer from the same blandness that Arya has. I was willing to forgive that because they actually have a semblance of intrigue.This book is a great read. There are twists and turns some of them are predictable others are not. I must say, I read this book in a few days because I could not put it down. I cannot say the same for the first one. I enjoyed visiting the Elven forests and seeing the adventures of Roran. I really enjoyed seeing Eragon's training and the culture of the elves that Paolini paints so well. Much Better Then the First Though Still has Flaws While I blew through Aragon, Eldest took me much longer to read because I kept losing interest in the middle. I understood the need for Aragon to train and learn everything he could and for that to be explained to us, but I think other less avid fans may have lost interest completely. Once I finally made it to the last 100 pages it definately picked up again and I was extremely pleased to finally get some answers to questions that I (and Aragon) had been struggling with. Two of the greatest \"No?!?\" moments come in the last 3 chapters. I liked the way it ended, but the end only make me yearn for the next novel to come sooner. Slowly revealing I've never really read nor liked fantasy except for Harry Potter. I would have definitely prefered to read something about romance or drama, but the Inheritance Series changed my point of view. Many other people found it predictable or boring, but thats their opinion, my opinion is that I found it an amazing read and couldn't put it down. Of course it did seem to drag on at some parts, but the story overall was great with a surprising ironic twist at the end. Can't wait until the next book. Never Loved Fantasy Until Now It arrived on time and in good condistion. She really like it better then he thought he would. At a good price. good book I couldn't put it down. It was just a good as the first book and I can't wait for the third. Amazing Book He wrote the following. The books are filled with similar empty sentences. Nuf said.\"Writing is the heart and soul of my being. It is the means through which I bring my stories to life. There is nothing like putting words on a page and knowing that they will summon certain emotions and reactions from the reader. In my writing, I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\" --Christopher Paolini Who can say more? What's it about?: With the battle of Farthen Dur over, thousands dead, including Ajihad, and with the Twins and Murtagh missing, Eragon must continue the fight against the Empire with Saphira, enduring a debilitating scar across his back and the pain of a lost friend in his heart. Will they finally defeat Galbatorix or be killed in the struggle?What's good about it?: It has a pretty good plotline, with some cliches, but also some original, intriguing ideas. There are some awesome characters that you really grow to know and love. (Murtagh and Saphira are my favorites) Christopher Paolini includes several languages- the ancient language, the dwarf language, and the urgal language. I always thought that was really neat. Also, on that note, there are many interesting creatures in his world - the usual dwarves, elves, dragons and humans, but also urgals, raz'zak and letherblaka.What's not so good about it?: It *is* a little cliche in parts - it kind of reminds me of Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings rolled into one. But sometimes that's a good thing! It depends on what you like. Also, sometimes Eragon is frustratingly stupid, and you kind of want to smack him upside the head, but unfortunately can't.So would you recommend it?: Yes! It's great for anyone who loves books about fantasy, dragons, swordplay, magic, dumb human boys being spurned by elf women, etc.Keep looking for the fourth book! A Great Continuation of the Inheritance Saga I recommend that you real all three books...can't wait for book 4. If you are a fan of fantasy and adventure, this is the book for you. GREAT SERIES This book was a treat. Eldest was a highly enjoyable read from start to finish. What could be better than a well written fantasy novel that effectively incorporates aspects of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, while at the same time retaining its own originality? The characters and storyline are captivating, and the world that Poalini has created is just plain amazing. Both my father and I (a doctor and lawyer, respectively) could not get enough of this book, and are eagerly awaiting the third installment of Inheritance. For those of you who are clouded by Poalini's age, or jealous by his success, get off it. This book is a must read for anyone with an open mind who enjoys a bit of fantasy. A Must Read I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first. There were just too many strange things going on especially when Eragon visits the elves. Despite this, it was a pretty fun read.My one negative is that while many kids could enjoy the book I don't think many parents know that there is a \"bedroom scene\" between a dating couple. It's a little hard to skip over that part toobecause from there the story segways into another important story line...so my kids will be skipping the book.He's not a bad writer...hope he writes something else for a younger audience. So-So...caution for those with young readers. I READ ALOT. THIS BOOK WAS AN OKAY READ BUT I KEPT SWEARING I HAD READ IT BEFORE SOMEWHERE. I REALIZED I COULDN'T HAVE BUT HAVE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH MY LIBRARY ANYWAY. DOES ANYONE RECOGNIZE THIS STORY? I KNEW STUFF THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WAY BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE. NOT JUST A SMALL PART- BUT JUST ABOUT 80% OF THE BOOK. WEIRD. easy read again? I gave this only one star because its all that it deserved. The first book Eragon kept me enthralled.. I couldnt put it down. I waited with anticipation until Eldest came out. I'm half way through the book and for the first time in my life I am thinking hard about not finishing a book. I dont need to know what a colony of ants and their environment do while in the midst of training. Meditation I understand but to dwell upon every single detail is overkill. Its dry at this point due to too much detail. A shame too as this easily could have been the next Lord Of The Rings series due to the story of elves, dwarfs, and humans. Pass on this book! Too Detail Oriented I read _Eragon_, and I liked it a lot. Sure, and especially in hindsight, I could see that there were parallels to other works, but...then I read _Eldest_.Literally 20 seconds after I closed the book, my brain came to the frustrated, angry, irritated, and most of all DISAPPOINTED conclusion: \"This is Star Wars!\" Among other things.Let's review this: Orphan boy. Raised by uncle in rural setting. Discovers terribly secret and powerful item that the Empire MUST HAVE. Doesn't realize it. Empire's henchmen destroy uncle's home, killing uncle. Boy, upset and confused, leaves home with old, gruff wise man, who (later) turns out to be the last of the ancient race of warrior-police. Travels around with old man, witnessing the horrors of the Empire. Picks up roguish male companion (no gorilla; that would be a bit much). At about the same time, old man dies, in sacrifice. Hero and companion seek asylum with rebels. There's a huge battle, which the rebels eventually win, with some very precise, tricky, dangerous maneuvers.That was book one.In book two, the Empire Strikes Back *cough* and boy leaves the rebels as they seek a new place to call their base/home. He goes to a secluded wood, where he receives training from SURPRISE! the guy who's actually the last last of the warrior-police; just ancient. Not green, though. Hero spends time training while rebel heroes run into some trouble. Nothing they can't handle, though. At the end, there's a huge battle which the rebels (in this case) just barely win, and in which the protagonist finds that he is...the son of the Emperor's number-one evil warrior-policeman! And brother to the Emperor's NEW number-one evil warrior-policeman (the old guy being unfortunately dead)!! *Organ music plays* And that's basically where we leave our hero.The parallels should, by now, be fairly obvious.Mr. Paolini, you are, I think, a great writer, style-wise at least. But what, for the love of God, happened to your plot? I'll grant you Roran's story was original, or fairly so...but it's OVERSHADOWED by Eragon's.What a waste of good writing! WHAT A LET-DOWN!! This series is a masterpiece. I listened to both of Eragon books on CD while traveling across country. Needless to say I had to see the movie the day it was released.It taught me a good lesson. When I am offered a movie contract for I will make sure to have some creative control. Don't get me wrong, it was a passible fantasy movie, just no where on the same level as the book.~R~ Beautifully crafted world. I loved the first book, Eragon. It surprised me though, thatI indeed enjoyed it, because of the title being so very similar to Tolkien's Aragon. I thought, probably like many, what kind of cheesy foolish repeat or 'Ode to Tolkien' can this be? But low and behold I was wrong. It proved to have a heart of its own and one with its very own creative pulse. It had a simple yet deeply enticing grace that seemed to sweep me away. I was thoroughly entertained, and impressed, save for the last predictable battle scene, which left a little to be desired. Eragon seemed to lose steam towards the end. It became more 'actiony' and 'predictable', and less naturally enticing.And that should have warned me to have lower expectations for the second book. It is very difficult to continue one's success with \"series\" fiction. I commend Rowling, Tolkien, and many others for succesfully doing such. This second book definitely trails off. It loses its speed, and strands itself in a sea of tedious boredom, predictability, and bland complexities.Eldest seems to grow an opinionated outside critique on life. It doesnt't feel natural at all, nor does it fit in with the initial heart of the story that compelled me in. I can hear way too much of the author's voice, and opinions in this. And it feels forced. It doesn't make any logical sense that the Elves who deal with \"magic, energy, and a deep love of nature\" would be \"Athiests\" or \"Agnostics\". I have no problem with Athiesm, nor Agnosticism, but it simply doesn't fit here. It feels out of place, and forced. I wonder if the author, being as young as he is, is unaware of various ideas of spirituality, religion besides beliefs in a \"Personal God\", or \"Personal gods\". This was just one problem, out of many that I found in the book. But basically it is none of the little problems that I found troubling rather then the simple fact that the story in the second book is just not that good.It is sad because Eldest in a way very much diminishes Eragon. The whole entire story has taken on this \"video game-like\" quality where the characters have a certain amount of energy that builds up, gets depleted, and is restored. It feels at times like I am watching someone else play a fantasy video game. And, as we all know, that is not anyone's idea of a fun.I really wish that I didn't read this second book, for as I said before, it is no where close to as good as the first. I probably won't read the third. I will forget, by then, about how compelling the first book was, and will still have a sour taste in my mouth from this second book.If you thought that the first book was absolutely excellent then give this one a try. It is mildly interesting, and your passion for the initial book should propel you through to the end...which again was quite predictable. But if you found the first book to be average, or even slightly above average then I would recommend staying away from this book. It is no \"Godfather 3\" but it's pretty close. Loses Momentum Same as Eragon. My son refused to part with this book and has read it several times. Can't go wrong. My son's review Part 2 A HACKNEYED second attempt and a cardboard Tolkein rip-off...I LOVED IT! Perfect for all illiterate people who think they know how to read!! The Return of the Eragon Cliche This book is written well. The book is much different than the movie. I am looking forward to reading the next book in September. Good Book I enjoyed Eldest immensly. Not many books can pull me from video games, but this book and its prequel did just that. I enjoyed the progression through the book, but I wanted it to continue when I finished. I will be purchasing Brisingr when it is released. Excellent book This book was so well put together it is just amazing. Paolini continues to surprise me with his plot twists. I for one am looking forward to the next book, and can't wait to see how the trilogy ends. He is simply an amazing author and has a good thing going with Eragon and Eldest. Amazing book I have read this series before. It is so good i'm starting them over. I had three of the four books, so I wonted to have this second book to complete my series. Christopher Paolini did a wonderful job. I find the names to be so interesting, how does one come up with such wonderful thought. A grate gift. grate advinture Eldest was an excellent book about fantasy and magic beyound your wildest dreams! All of you out there who love magic and fantasy-related animals and creatures, this is the book for you! It contains magic, dragons, elves, sorceresses, dwarves, the dragon-riders, and much, much more!It keeps you on your toes and on the edge of your seat at all times. It will leave you begging for more. However, to understand it, you must read Eragon.Eldest is about the young Dragon-rider Eragon and his dragon, Saphira. They venture across the land of Alegaesia, fighting off evil and saving people from it. Together with the varden, elves, and dwarves, Eragon and Saphira try to overthrow the evil king, Galbatorix. Will they suceed, and will they finally rid their land from Galbatorix's evil grasp? Read Eldest to find out. Eldest: A must read for all fantsy lovers! Okay, so I just have to say how funny this is for me. While reading the beginning of Eragon the first thing I said to my husband was, \"this book is like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings.\" I didn't think anything of it, finished the book (fairly enjoying it considering the young authors age), and then checked out the reviews out of curiousity to find everyone else noting the same comparisons I did! It's hilarious! And yes, a sad, sad truth to what I had heard was a unique and creative novel. Even people like me who are unfamiliar with Star Wars (I've only seen one) and Lord of the Rings (watched the first one) could see this uncanny similiarity. Good luck Paolini-it's a good thing you didn't write this for a college course (you could be expelled for plagarism) :) Can't help but laugh... I enjoyed it. I read Eragon on an early release to ebooks and have been waiting since then for Eldest. I think this is the 1st time I've started a series where all of the books weren't out. Dang, I hate that! Sure hope #3 doesn't take 2 years!I gave it 4 stars because his writing style needs a little bit of work. That's ok, it takes writers a while to mature. It was a good book. The story line was decent, it sucked me in pretty early, etc. I wouldn't compare him to Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Lewis, Tad Williams, etc. yet ... but maybe a few books down the road. Hence 4 stars. Good read - waiting for the 3rd The first book was a fairly solid read. Not great, but entertaining. And coming from a 19 year old, the future looked promising. But as often happens to those who experience success very early, things start to go downhill quickly.This book needed an editor to step in and say no. It is long and boring and the entire subplot with Roran is mystifying. Brom and Eregagon need all of their skills and magic to get away from the bad guys (which kills Brom), but Roran just needs a hammer and a bunch of villagers???The time Eragon spends with Osmosis (or whatever the heck his name is) in the dark mysterious Elven woods reads way too much like Luke and Yoda on Degoba. And it just goes on and on and on. I don't blame the writer, the professionals around him let him down badly. Where was his editor? Eldest is a very puzzling book. It is good because of the story behind the story, but the story itself is not that great. Since this sentence is pretty confusing, let me explain:Eldest is the second volume in the Inheritance trilogy being penned by Christopher Paolini. The first volume \"Eragon\" was a stupendous hit. I believe that one of the reasons it was so popular was that the author started writing the book when he was 15 years old and that story circulated everywhere. Anyone who read Eragon could see how the fifteen year old writer was maturing as a writer through the course of the book. That process continues in Eldest. The descriptive passages are becoming fuller and the fleshing out of the characters is more serious. However, Paolini is no longer a fifteen year old maverick: he is now an established writer in his early twenties. So, the leeway that was afforded before does not apply now and on that basis the faults in his writing are showing up. For instance, the author is obviously spending a lot of time studying the meaning of words. This is readily apparent in some of his descriptive passages where he uses much more complex words than are needed. It is good that a writer enjoys the language and finds just the right words to express the feelings of the scene, but in this volume that is carried to an unnecessary extreme. On the other hand, the author is not mature enough to address some of his topics. His character Eragon falls in love with the elf Arya. Clearly the author has not absorbed enough of the real world ways of men wooing women to explain it in novel form. His attempts are very stilted, stiff, and unreal.Another criticism is that this volume is very repetitive of many other swords & Sorcery stories. This volume breaks new ground in only one thing. At a certain point at the end of the story, races that were enemies, become allies. Outside of that one twist, the rest of the story was very predictable. I was able to anticipate every major plot twist and turn hundreds of pages in advance. For example, the cover illustration is of a red dragon. Eragon's dragon - Saphira - is blue and the other know dragon is black. So, where does a red dragon come from? We had a family discussion about this before reading the book and I predicted what actually transpired. I am not that big of a fan of this genre that I spend all of my time reading fantasy books - and yet I was able to easily predict many of the events in the book.So, what's good about this book? Well, if you read Eragon, it is fun to continue to see the evolution of the author through his words. As a fantasy \"epic\" it is also fun to follow Eragon and the other main characters and see how they develop. But, given the negative comments above, I cannot really recommend this book too much. If you liked Eragon, it's worth reading. If you did not read, or did not like Eragon, then don't get it. Highlights and lowlights abound Well, I picked up Eragon because I heard it was pretty good. I was in the need of an original book, so I figured I would give it a try. It turned out ok. I was impressed with the age of the author, but was also dissapointed on how much of his ideas were not original. Still, there was something fun about a jedi dragon rider.Upon picking up the seconed book, I was hoping his age would allow him to move past Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and so many other great pieces of work he copied. Obviously, I was wrong. Little aspects throughout the book kept taking from other wonderful stories. I soon became extremely bored. I have had this book for about 6 months now, and I still havn't finished it. I just can't!! It's almost as though Paolini opened up all of his favorite books, randomly threw darts at them, and wherever the dart landed, took that sentence/plot/idea and put it into his book.Besides the plagarism, the characters do not develop at all! In fact, they seem to somehow grow more and more dull! The worst part of the book is when it goes back to Rorans story. Everytime it does, I put the book down and can't pick it up again for weeks. It is just so boring!!I am trying very hard to finish this book, just because I hate leaving a story unfinished. I won't, however, be purchasing or reading another book by Paolini. I have also lost all interest in watching the movie.Once I have finished, I plan on selling both Aragorn...oops...mean Eragon and Eldest.One word to sum it all up....!!!!!!YAWN!!!!!! Yawn, Yawn, Yawn..... Excellent story line. A great second half to a fantastic story. Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) Maybe you can chalk it up to second book let down, but this was far weaker than Eragon, slow moving and verbose like there was a word count to fulfill. The part that bothered me was the attempt to say that the lowest bug and man were in reality of the same value. This on it's face may be likened to the beliefs of Hinduism, but that too is crushed by the assertion that anyone that is really enlightened does not believe in God. The book also states that one who is enlightened will not eat the flesh of another living being. It then goes on to give plants a low level of awareness, I wonder why the enlightened are allowed to eat at all. Please don't Preach. I've been reading and enjoying fantasy for many years, and am neither young nor stupid. This book, put simply, was horrific. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I am entirely baffled at how anyone could think this is well written or inventive. Paolini is a thief. He should be ashamed of himself for such outright plagiarism. Even a young kid should know better. To Traci, \"dude\" As an audiobook listener it was wonderful to hear the story told to me. I am able to form pictures of the people and places of Alegasia in my mind. I highly recommend this book to adults as well as children but you really must read Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1) first so you don't miss out on the entire tale. I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the tale. Christopher Paolini's writing is phenomenal. Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) I do not understand why everyone is so upset about this book. The bad reviews are endless! Of course, one cannot take a bad review seriously when 4/5 of the words are spelled incorrectly. People who don't use proper grammar and punctuation don't deserve to live.Eldest is an enchanting sequel to Eragon. Paolini has matured right alongside his characters. Usually, the second book in a trilogy is the most uneventful and boring. Although there are a few dull spots, I believe Eldest is better than Eragon. As far as being uneventful, just read the ending!Eldest has a slightly darker tone to it, which is fitting. Eragon and the others are realizing the gravity of their dire situation. Every action they make has life changing repurcussions.This is a gripping tale of the growing bond between a boy who makes some foolish mistakes, and a dragon who must do all she can to protect her Rider. A High-Quality Book! Eldest has to be the worst book I've ever laid eyes on. There is little plotting, monkeys could come up with beter dialog, and I was bored to tears until the end. I read Melissa's review of Eldest and then nodded my head in understanding. I too feel ripped off by this book/author. I wondered why so many people were singing the praises of a one book author, especially when that book was mediocre at best. This past Sunday, our pastor said in his sermon, \"And the truth shall set you free.\" The truth has certainly shed light here. I won't be reading any more books by this author or published. Knopf you've got my last dollar! I feel ripped off This book is truly better than the previous one (Eragon). Although I find many of the plots rather similiar to George Lucas's Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back. I like some of the events that happened around Saphira and Eragon. Better than the previous book. I have really enjoyed this book. The shipping was reasonable and I got it petty quickly. I can't wait for the next book! Wonderful book! I'll start with the bad, since it is the most prevalent...bad:Dialouge - its just bad, some of the worst I've ever read. Its like watching the movie \"Troy\" where every line is a one-liner.Character Development - The characters do develop, but in a lame sort of way. \"Press this button and you're magically 10x more powerful... \" The characters are pushed around by where the plot needs to push them (plot-driven story) rather than the plot evolving based on how the characters interact with the world (character-driven story.)Wordage - Sometimes it feels like Paolini randomly throws in \"big words\" that are very out of place. It sort of goes back to the Dialouge/Character development. I honestly got the impression that he had a dictionary out from time to time and thumbed in a big one just for the hell of it. Do you really think an illiterate farmboy would be elloquent and speak like he was a war general in the latest epic film? Didn't think so.Good:The way Paolini portrays the young kids in this book is actually pretty good. The introspection from the 16 yr olds reminds me of being that age. The problem with this is that *every* character in the book feels like a 16 yr old kid.The story is decent. I agree it borrows a lot from other areas, but that doesn't bother me so much. When was the last time you read something that was really 100% original? Who cares. Still better than 99.9% of what hollywood is producing for entertainment value.Overall, an entertaining book. I'm not lamenting spending my twenty bucks on this book, and I may pick it up again since it is an easy read, but I would never recommend it to anyone who is a heavy reader.Recommended to someone who wants some light reading that is easy on the brain. Just O.K. This second book in the series was excellent. Not the same old SciFi Fantacy. A very promising new author. Hope to read many more quality books from him. Thanx for the great read. Eldest (Inheritance) Eragorn suffered from being written by a teenager whose writing lacked emotional depth. The plot was episodic, and in places it dragged. The characters were flat and were not always consistent. Eragorn's relationship with Saphria was the most enjoyable aspect of the book.Eldest, at this point in my foray into a library copy, suffers from these same flaws. The writing falls short of \"lyrical\" (Tolkien and Seamus Heaney are safe from ouster by Paolini for the moment). Instead, often the clunky awkwardness of Miriam-Webster's seeps through. I don't doubt Paolini has a large vocabulary, but he does not deploy it to his best advantage, and often \"look at me\" words jar the narrative. A big word does not automatically imbue a scene with deep meaning, and too often Paolini's SAT-grade vocabulary seems to be trying to impose signifigance from without, when all along it's been lacking from within.Simpy put, Paolini just doesn't have the life experience--call it maturity if you want--to write convincingly about many of the emotions and events he wants to portray. I often feel he is saying something because he thinks that's how it's supposed to be described by a \"writer\" and not because it's a phrase or passage that arose out of his own emotional engagement with his imaginary world. And for that reason, I have a very difficult time becoming emotionally invested in Eldest. Because adults are more likely to notice things like this than kids (simply a difference in life experience), adults may find Eldest frustrating or unreadable this reason, while the needlessly drawn-out plot may lose kids' attention, as well as adults'--as it does mine at times. Basically, those who insist on writing that is at least more than minimally competent for publication will probably find Eldest lacking in a very important element.Dialogue is still awkward. It's best when Saphria is speaking, because of the characters only she truly has her own voice. I suspect words like \"alas\" are supposed to elevate it to high fantasy, but the syntax simply makes them stand out awkwardly.Character development happens in sudden bursts, so Eragon's farmhand cousin goes from country bumpkin to general-at-war with no transition phase. Eragon remains rather tepid, surrounded by (relatively) more interesting characters.As Eldest is even longer than Eragon, inevitably the plot becomes simply too protracted. Many mature writers can't sustain a story over that length, and Paolini could have taken several oportunities to tighten up his plot and shave extraneous material. I'm a little curious about the other dragon, so I'll plug away (I have established a program of reading a certain amount every evening), but be prepared for a long hike. Most of the revelations were not particularly surprising, since this is so grounded in fantasy conventions, but one was mostly unanticipated on my part.Overall, this has been a sporadic read for me. At times I am interested (though, again, never yet emotionally engaged except a little at times towards Saphria, the dragon), but often I must work through several chapters that, frankly, do not appeal to me, either in their narrative or characters.In my opinion, the books are a long way from deserving a fraction of the hype. For a high-school age teenager, Eragon was above average. For a published work, it was mediocre at best. Eldest is on about the same level, and although other popular authors have also produced poorly written work, in this case the age gimmick should have worn off by now. Judged as professionally published books, I think both books are not impressive.BUT, if you loved Eragon, run out and buy this. There's more of the same, and it's always great to get back in touch with characters you liked. If you were moderately interested, go to the library (and try not to reward Knopf for publishing such under-edited work). If you hated it, well, you probably ought not to be reading anything else by the same author. same shortcomings as Eragon, but if you liked the first, you'll like this too I was, indeed, rather disturbed after reading the eldest. It is an entertaining story, got me thinking of elves and dwarves and what's nots for a few days. But I found many things confusing about what I was reading and somehow unrealistic. I've read many reviews of this book, and the only ones that rang true to me, were the ones which rated this book in the low range. At first, I couldn't quiet put a finger on the problem of the book, but then complaints began to pour. It was all very unrealistic. The behaviors, the romantic scenes, the plot even. Why, for example, does Eragon have to change, to become an elf, in order to defeat evil? Wouldn't it be better for him to be who he is, to fight the evil with the strenght he's got within and not get it somehow from the outside. No one can relate to that, and frankly, I was discusted after I learned of his change. Characters are so very shallow. I guess there's too much description, or something, since the book is so long and I can't relate to the characters somehow, for there are books half the lenght I read three times or more and couldn't stop thinking of. I'm not an experienced writer or someone like it, though I am an experienced reader and I have read hundreds of books. For some reason, I guess because of the Eldest, I expected and hoped for something else, something better. It was either because Christopher worked more on the first book, or he got someone to edit it for him, either way. I've read the book in summer, few days after it came out, but even now I've got this sickening feeling in me. Obviously, young writers can't write. I have to remember that before I think of getting published. You need maturity, deeper understanding of life, technique of writing, mysteries of character development and so forth. Even for all of my chriticism, I guess I'll buy the third book anywyas, when it comes out, probably with harry potter again. However, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be very rushed, a lot of things will be piled into it, some unnecessary info. If I knew what I would have felt after reading Eldest today, I don't think I would have read it. If you bothered to read this line, I believe you are seriously thinking of buying the Eldest. Well, the only think I can say is, \"Hope you'll enjoy it and don't be annoyed about spening your money on it after reading the book.\"Au revoir. Disturbing... This book, make you feel as Alagaesia really exist. The descriptive paragraph are so clear, that you can almost see what is going on. You can't stop reading it, you need to know what is going to happend next. I can't wait for the next one! I can't wait for the last book! This was a really good book. I have not read Eragon yet but will soon Great read I bought Eragon shortly after it was released but never got to read it. I finally started reading it about 2 months ago and could not put it donw. I finished Eragon and immediatly went to look when the next \"Inheritance\" book would be coming out and I was so thrilled when I found out it would be within the next month. I have now finished Eldest and am anxiously awaiting the next book of Inheritance. Eldest was just as good as the first book Eragon. I look forward to see what happens :)This is a GREAT book for anyone who loves dragons and any aspect of the fantasy realm. Where is the next one? I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Eragon. I am so amazed that these books were written by someone so young. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out to continue the adventure Great Book Keep up the good work! Keep up the good work I didn't believe the bad reviews of this book and bought it anyway. Probably the BIGGEST mistake I've ever made. When I returned it to Hastings the lady said I was the third person today to return it. In no way does the writing achieve lyrical beauty or anything close to it. Truly awful writing with laughable cartoon characters. Truly AWFUL This book is average fantasy. It is not original enough to deserve the praise heaped on it by those who enjoy the books. At the same time, it is not so awful that it deserves to be banned, as some people seem to think. Right off the bat, the title \"Eldest\" is gramatically incorrect, as it refers to the older of two characters. I won't say who they are for those how haven't read the book, but the title really should be \"Elder\", which I guess while correct doesn't sound as dramatic. That seems to be par for the course.The action finally picks up in the last 100 pages, but the rest of the book feels like filler. It is not exciting and the attempts at lyrical descriptions felt forced. A lot of people have complained that they needed a thesaurus to get through this book, because Paolini wrote it using words that most people never use or don't even know. That is a poor choice of style, because the most descriptive writers never use SAT words, but write in a way that is easy to comprehend with everyday words that everyone can easily relate to.A great deal of the book involves Eragon's training to be a Rider. He is constantly drilled to be patient and listen to the world around him to gain a better understanding of life. But this is completely overriden by one plot point I wasn't too keen on. Eragon is \"touched\" by the memory of the dragons in an elvish ceremony and immediately is healed of a debilitating wound, attains almost superhuman strength and speed and looks more like an Elf. That to me was cop-out. What made Eragon interesting to me was that he would go every morning during his training and get beaten down by the Elves because as a human he was weaker and slower. His wound was a burden he carried that also made him more human. Despite his wound, Eragon's determination to fight at least made him interesting, and he was slowly but surely increasing in his ability to do magic. Magically healing him and essentially making him an Elf took away his humanity. I guess Paolini felt that this was the only way the character could effectively compete with the as yet unseen Galbatorix, but I just didn't think much of that.The bottom line is that it is an average fantasy book. It has some decent parts but you're better off getting it from a library. It's not worth a hardcover purchase. Doesn't deserve the hate or the hype I could not put the book down. Both this book as well as the first had me on the edge of my seat. The writing is extremely descriptive which puts you inside of the adventure. I highly recommed this book for reading if you are a fantasy fan! I cant wait for the last of the trilogy. Wonderful I personaly loved this book. But I was looking at the other reviews and I think this is just one of those books people love to hate. All the bad reviews seemed to say the same thing and half the reviews written by \"concerned parents\" have at leat 2 words miss spelled.Eldest also seemed to have grown since the first book. I know half the kids that read this book were dissapointed because of the lack of action... but GROW UP!! I'm Dissapionted...but not at the book This book is huge. My nephew loved it and hasn't put the book down since Christmas. Big Book for a little price It's a good book if you like books that involve dragons, middle earth, and adventure. It has a little bit of everything in it. I usually don't read books but when I bought and read this I was shocked that i read the whole thing. Good Book I am absolutely surprised that the first three reviews seen are negative! I love the story that Paolini wrote. He may not be Tolkien or JK Rowling but he's still very young and quite talented.Listen, I'm not trying to have a life-affirming epiphany here, I just want a good story and Paolini delivers. He may struggle with the language when trying to be prosaic, using obscure words when simple ones would do. However, it's a small thing and the story more than makes up for it. His writing is good enough to make me willingly suspend my disbelief and get lost in the story. Love it! The sequel to _Eragon_ isn't satisfied with being as derivative and clich&eacute;d as the first book, it kicks it up a notch by ripping off _Lord of the Rings_ by sticking in a quasi-Lothlorian Elf home, then bogarting a concept from Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar Saga by turning Eragon into some sort of hybrid elf overnight. This ill-conceived makeover basically turns him into another character. Gone is the boy who made the first book at least somewhat interesting, in his place is this powerful, magical, well-read, yet still incredibly dull man. You really can't blame his love interest (some elf woman whose name I can never remember because she has all the dimension of a sheet of cardboard) for leaving whenever he's around; I wouldn't want to be near him either, I'd probably go into a coma from boredom.This book may be longer than the first one, but it's far less entertaining. The big mystery attacker at the end of the battle is so obvious right off, and it's no surprise when the Twins show up, or that they were the betrayers in the first place. The villains are obvious in this series and subtlety in general is something of which the author seems to have no concept.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone over twelve, or any experienced fantasy reader at all. We've seen it all before and Paolini has nothing new to add. Readable, but not much more than that Read the book before. My kids seen the movie Eragon and I told them that they had books on them. They asked me to get them so I can help them read the books before they go to bed. Movie doesn't do the book justice. But great choice. My boys love them. Great Book Entirely disappointing if not plaigerized from Tolkien's work. I'm surprised there aren't any lawsuits over this yet. Clearly the history of dwarves is taken directly from Tolkien. Other entire pages and passages seem to be taken from other sources as well. Reprehensible This book was fantastic. It kept me interested until the very last page. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy. Awesome!!! 10/10 Eldest I read Eragon and enjoyed it. Eldest is even better. If you enjoy Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, I recommend the Inheritance trilogy. There's lots of action, fantasy, and suspense! If you saw the Lord of the Rings movies, remember how the movies ended and you were like,\"what, it's over?\" that's how I felt about this book. I am greatly anticipating the third and final book of the trilogy! Can't wait for Inheritance Hundreds of reviews by disallusioned readers doesn't even begin to cover my outrage over this book. I'm not sure what makes me more mad how bad the book is or that once again reviews by honest people are disappearing left and right. In looking at reviews of Eldest 80% or more were/are from people who disliked this book. I wonder if the reviews of Eragon wouldn't be about the same if so many reviews hadn't disappeared into thin air.Dozens and dozens of readers have said, I'll say it again this is the last Paolini book I will ever read. Like others I'm disappointed this book doesn't have better writing and editing. There's no way this book should run so long. A good editor should have trimmed by as much as 50% or more. It would have made the book readable at the least and possibly even enjoyable. Instead I find a bloated, overwritten book that reads like a train wreck. Never again... Send it back is right!! Eldest, written by Christopher Paolini, won the 2006 quill book award and followed his first book, Eragon, to the New York Times bestseller list. In Eldest, Eragon now journeys to the land of the elves, Du Weldenvarden, where he further trains to become a Dragon Rider, learning the skills of magic and swordsmanship. He knows that another encounter with Galbortorix could wipe out the Varden in one blow. He meets Arya, the beautiful daughter of the queen, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Eragon's cousin Roran fight a new battle in Carvahall, and becomes the unlikely leader skirmishing against the evil Ra'zac and for his beloved Katrina. Only 21 years old, Paolini has made the settings and the characters incredibly realistic and credible. This isn't just another fantasy book about dragons and knights; this is a book with a developed plot that is very believable. Eldest is a great book for all readers but especially readers who like fantasy. Due to intense descriptions of gore and bloodshed, I think that this book is best for readers fourth grade and up. great book!! Just finished reading this book. Christopher Paolini has succeeded as much with Eldest as he did with Eragon. The story continues where Eragon left off, and carries the action thru what is usually the 'muddled middle', however, in this saga, there is just as much action here as in Eragon. Paolini writes a very rich and descriptive story, I felt like I was a part of the action, and I had absolutely no problems imagining how everyone and everything looked from his descriptions. An amazing and very exciting twist at the end of the story has me waiting - not so patiently - for the final chapter in the Inheritance trilogy. Please, Chris, hurry and get it done, but not so fast that the story suffers!!!! A Fitting Second Chapter to the Saga As a fantasy book Eldest is pretty good. I did think it better than Eragon, however I didn't think the first 150 pages were as good as the balance of the book.There are two glaring things I am had trouble with while reading this book. That is 1.) in the three days between Eragon and Eldest, Eragon seems to have turned from a 15 year old into a 25 year old. This might be due to the author's ages when writing the two books. The second is that while some might argue that Eragon mirrored the Star Wars \"A New Hope\" storyline, there is definatly no way to argue against Eldest mirroring Star Wars, \"Empire Strikes Back\". At some point in the book I actually started laughing about it, and was able to predict most of what was going to happen from then on out because I knew the storyline of Empire Strikes Back. While I liked the origional Star Wars triligy, I have already read it many times. I would have wished that Mr. Paolini wouldn't have mirrored the storyline so closely. I can only hope this trend does not continue with the final book of the triligy (however he has basically set it up to do so).Having said that though, if you like fantasy or liked Eragon you are sure to like Eldest. It definatly is worth picking up and reading. Good book.... but Mr. Paolini obviously likes Star Wars When my son wanted to return this book to Amazon, I asked him why and we talked about the book. I couldn't believe a book could be published that was so poorly written so I read it myself and was appalled. Glaring errors, disastrous editing, poorly written, poorly organized. Clearly the most overrated book in years. Paolini you've got the last dime you'll ever get from our family of readers. This telephone book should have been trimmed to 1/2 size at the least. Returning it.......so should you This book gets three stars because he tried, it wasn't horrible, and being a published author twice-over at the age of 21 is impressive. Now, getting to why it did not receive more than three stars. First, as one reviewer said, the characters/plot are very two-dimensional - to the point of predictability. Secondly, as another review said (but I'll say it a bit more nicely), it's obvious that he was, and still is, sheltered. He does get some points for the political point that he made, although it was so obviously placed, I have to wonder if it was a last minute addition at the suggestion of his editors.This review isn't coming from someone 20+ years older, nor is it from a star-struck teen whose journey into literature has been littered with quality seen in Harry Potter. I am the author's age and have actually read the likes of Tolkein (before the movies), Salvatore, Wells, Kazantzakis,(to name favorites) and other authors from other genres.Paolini's work wavers between fiction for children and a deep desire to have a certain amount of maturity. Here's a suggestion to Mr. Paolini: Consider each review, live on your own for a bit, take a break before the third book, and finally, most importantly before writing more love-angst for your characters, have your heart broken. He tries - a little too hard i bought this for my son he loves it reads it over and over again. eldest I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied Very happy If you liked Eragon, then you will like this sequel. All the books in this series are great! Can't wait for the final book. Great book You would hope that in a second effort, lessons would have been learned and perhaps acted upon. No such luck in Eldest. This book gasps for editorial attention. The number one thought in a reader's mind should not be the quality of the writing. Here, it was. Disappointed Eldest (Inheritance, Book2)By: Christopher PaoliniReviewed by: Samuel ChooP. 3The perilous journey continues as Eragon defeats the Shade Durza with a dramatic battle under Farthen' Dur. After Eragon defeats Durza, he falls into a deep sleep and the Mourning Sage talks to him in his dream. Eragon wakes up and now sets out for a new and more dangerous journey. A new world unfolds and lies ahead of him as he sets out for Ellesmera, the home to the mystic and shadowy elves. With Murtagh gone, taken by the Urgals, Brom killed by the Ra'Zaac, Eragon now travels with Saphira and the beautiful elf, Arya. As they travel, Eragon ponders in an ocean of many questions, all waiting to be answered as soon as they arrive Ellesmera. They arrive and he meets the Mourning Sage, and his dragon. The riders teach each other and the dragons teach each other. As they train, a war is fought at Eragon's hometown, with Roran leading the battle. A war shall spew from the ground like hot magma out of a volcano and erupt into a new great battle.This book was very excting and fun. Although it wasn't as fun as the first book, IT WAS STILL GREAT. Never ending action, the romance, THE BLOODSHED, it was all great. Everything about this book is exciting which made me enjoy it so much. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. It had everything you wanted. You couldn't even ask for more.This book contained LOTS OF ACTION. Including the training, the war, just so much fighting. The war contained a lot of fighting, INCLUDING a special fight between two dragon riders. Another action part is when Roran and the village fights the empire. Using farming tools and other tools, they defeat the empire's army and move on. There is also lots of love in this story. It is very obvious because Eragon's heart spills out for Arya. Sadly, he gets rejected because Arya is old. Poor Eragon.Now, my favorite part of the story is the 1on1 dragon rider fight. It is a fierce battle with two strong dragon riders clashing swords, dragons ripping flesh and scale, words of death spoken from skilled mouths. Blue vs. Red. Friend vs. Foe. A deadly battle and an unforgettable one. A great conflict with no match. A great fight indeed. Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) This book was way to long. If you want a great undiscovered book with tons of imagination read Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo. It shows how good a non-hyped book can be. There are way better reads A very good sequel to volume 1 of this series. Readable, mysterious, entertaining fantasy fiction with a solid moral basis. volume 2 dependant upon volume 1 Now, Eragon I could stand, even if it required actually sitting and reading it because it was so darn badly written. Most of the time, the first book got to the point. Not always, but most of the time. Eldest, however, should have had most of it cut.Half the time I wasn't even paying attention to what was happening in the book, thinking about nothing, because...well, that was just it. NOTHING was happening in the book. I could zone out, and ten minutes later, I looked back and realized that I had missed NOTHING of importance. It's 600 pages of NOTHING and 100 pages of laughable writing that includes Eragon attempting to court the icy, preachy Arya, Roran's sidestory quest thing that seemed to go nowhere, and then a spastic battle at the end. Everything else was ripped from Lord Of The Rings, Earthsea, Pern, and Star Wars, and then dumbed down.Overall - Paolini has not improved. At all. If anything, he's gotten worse. \"Aye\" is used too frequently. He tries to make himself look smart with all his big words when it really makes him look like a thesaurus-thumping hack. He also tries to use archaic language, and then it contrasts horribly with some modern phrases he uses. His attempts at sounding more \"mature\" by inserting naked elves and hairless elf groins were unsuccessful, and was a disgrace to Tolkein's elves. I will give him credit for at least trying to make the Tolkein clone elves his own, though.But I'm still not forgiving him for turning graceful creatures into...well, A-S said it best: \"nudist vegan hippies.\" \"Ew\" is the only word I can think of for it",

         "Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week. Wonderful, wonderful book !! I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !! The truth about WOTWS This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable. Whispers of the Wicked Saints I read the review directly under mine and I have to say I laughed. How can someone write a honest review on a book they read only three pages of? That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it. Bravo Veronica",

         "Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is \"Interesting!\" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty. Good structure makes good bones for story It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne Awesome - wanna use dramatica? You definitely need this book This is the way to get a handle on the incredibly complex yet useful theory of Dramatica and its program. At one time I almost went crazy trying to figure out how to use it with my writing and finally gave up, until I found this book. Armando is a genius. Armando is Great",

         "This collection brings together a distinguished group of researchers to examine the power relations which are played out in university law schools as a result of the different pressures exerted upon them by a range of different 'stakeholders'. From students to governments, from lawyers to universities, a host of institutions and actors believe that law schools should take account of a vast number of (often conflicting) considerations when teaching their students, designing curricula, carrying out research and so on. How do law schools deal with these pressures? What should their response be to the 'stakeholders' who urge them to follow agendas emanating from outside the law school itself? To what extent should some of these agendas play a greater role in the thinking of law schools? Fiona Cownie Law",

         "\"Beginner's Yoruba\" is now available with two accompanying audio CDs. It provides an introduction to the Yoruba language, which is spoken by over 30 million people in south-western Nigeria, parts of the Benin Republic, and Togo, as well as in the diaspora populations of Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti. The 15 lessons are designed for both classroom use and self-study. Practice dialogues, combined with grammatical explanations, aid the student in understanding the basics of the language. Each lesson also contains a vocabulary section that highlights the important aspects of its featured topic. The audio CDs, which complement the lessons, help the student easily master the language's unique tones and vowel sounds, often considered the most difficult aspect of the language to learn. Quizzes and practice exercises are integrated into the lessons to help reinforce the material. The book also includes information on various aspects of Yoruba culture, including religion, songs, and folklore. Kayode J. Fakinlede Foreign Language Study",
         "This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it. Very authentic",

Jim Fay Family & Relationships",
         "I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a \"good day\". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the \"I know\" , \"Nice try\" and \"I love you too much to argue\". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!! A MUST FOR EVERY PARENT !!!! Jim Fay is the master of removing parents (as the reason) for bad decisions that kids make. He makes the process of parenting simple and effective. The sooner you start this approach with your children, the more you'll love being a parent.

Mature. Joann Sfar Comics & Graphic Novels",
         "I passed over The Rabbi's Cat repeatedly in the graphic novel section of my bookstore... the cover was a bit of a turn-off and the size is a bit cumbersome. I finally flipped through it at my library and checked it out. I'm beating myself up now for not reading this sooner! What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics. A great read. This was a book club selection and, at first, I thought it was simply a comic book. Wrong. This is a charming, thought provoking little book that can be read at many different levels. No wonder my rabbi was the one who suggested that we read this. If you understand the basics of Judiasm, you'll get more out of this book. But even if you are not, you will be charmed by this fanciful tale. Thought provoking Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels. I found it interesting but still prefer when reading a novel to have my own ideas of the people and surroundings. Guess that why after reading a novel I am not impressed with going to a movie with hollywood interruptations. Grafic Novels The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs. good artwork too!",

Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.

But this year the battle went wrong as Darak's brother became possessed by the spirit of the Holly. To free him, Darak must undertake a quest to restore the very balance of nature. Barbara Campbell Fiction",
         "The tribe of the Oak has suffered tremendous losses due to plague but they still intend to observe the midwinter ritual where the Oak-Lord and the Holly-lord battle. Oak defeats Holly so that spring will arrive. Darak the hunter is not looking forward to this ritual because his beloved brother Tinnean will become Tree-Brother, apprenticed to the Tree father and will owe his allegiance to his master instead of his family.When it is time to travel to the dimension where the First Forrest lives, Darak refuses to join them and witness the loss of the brother who will be part of yet separate from the tribe. Something goes wrong at the ritual and the Oak and Tinnean disappear. Tinnean's body is inhabited by the Holly-Lord while the Oak and Darak's brother are in the land of Chaos, put there by the spirit of Morgoth, the evil Tree-Father, who held the position before Strauth killed him. Darak and his allies prepare to do battle to bring Tinnean back into his body and finish the rite so spring will return.Think Jean Auel and Judith Tarr and readers will have some idea what HEARTWOOD is all about. The setting feels prehistoric with magic an everyday occurrence. Darak is a strong stubborn man who loves deeply and wants to keep those he cares about close to him safe; when his brother is in danger he is willing sacrifices himself to free his sibling from the enemy. Barbara Campbell creates characters readers will care about and produces a storyline that grabs reader interest.Harriet Klausner mindful of Jean Auel and Judith Tarr After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read. winter's tale The best fantasy writers not only invite us to explore the magical, but guide us along the way with credible, world-building skills and sympathetic, recognizable characters that engage our imagination, but never tax our belief. Such is the case with Barbara Campbell's HEARTWOOD.I read this book over the course of a weekend in spring but for all I knew, I was not sitting in my backyard with the drone of cars and leaf-blowers and other modern \"conveniences\" competing for my attention. Instead, I was transported to the land of the Oak-Lord and the Holly-Lord where a Midwinter battle determined the advent of spring or the curse of a world locked in the frozen grip of winter.And it is \"heart\" that is the key word in this novel. While the fantastic descriptions will delight and frighten, the characters, from the troubled hero, Darak, to the wise, but aging Tree-Father,Struath, to the sadistic villain Morgath --all-- are \"known\" to us on some level. And that, in my opinion, is this author's greatest gift. Even the god Trickster, cunning, conceited and unpredictable as he is, reminds us of the times we wonder if our Maker doesn't have an unusual sense of humor.If you want to experience a seemingly lost world where the changing seasons are greeted with hope, awe and wonder versus large appliance sales, read HEARTWOOD. I can't wait for Ms. Campbell's next book. A Book for All Seasons",

         "8.0",
         "Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries. Thomas Paine History",
         "This is an excellent collection of the evident, palpable reasons for self-rule, written for the common folk of the time in an inspiring style. Now more than ever we need to revisit the foundations of self-rule and individual rights. Freedom is not easy; it is hard. Freedom is not safe; it is dangerous. RS Remember our origins It's good to have all Paine's material in one handy volume. Plenty to read and think about. It's a pity he's not better known in the USA, considering his significance in the existence of the country. What a useful collection. This is virtually the ultimate collection on Thomas Paine, the daring revoloutionary in his own right. I have been familar with his writings particularly 'Common Sense' and the 'Rights of Man' and various pamphlets but I had not read his controversial, for the time, \"The Age of Reason'. I had a rebirth in my interest in Paine when listening to Clay Jenkinson discuss Paine during the \"The Thomas Jefferson Hour\". Jenkinson described Paine as a great patriot with his enlightening arguments in 'Common Sense' while 'The Age of Reason' was described as very daring, costing him many of his supporters, for questioning religion. In reason, Paine speakes as deist, believing in a supreme being yet a being that does not intervene in human life or alter the laws of nature. It's an intellectual argument that raises fascinating questions, particularly for the time although Deism had a relatively significant following in parts of the western world. This is a great respource on the writings of Paine, a great book to pull off the shelf and read a particular article. Thus, this compilation provides you pretty much the complete writings of Thomas Paine, certianly the essential Thomas Paine, in a handsome single volume. Just About The Complete Collection of Thomas Paine Thomas Paine was one of our founding fathers, was a \"true child of the Enlightenment\" and believed in the primacy of reason. Through his writings, especially \"Common Sense,\" and \"The American Crisis\" (\"these are the times that try men's souls,\") he became the \"voice\" of the American Revolution.He was a brilliant writer who appealed to a mass audience and was far ahead of his time. Carl Sagan tells us that he \"courageously opposed monarchy, aristocracy, racism, slavery, superstition and sexism when all of these constituted the conventional wisdom.\"In \"The Rights of Man\" he defended the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution against the conservative Edmund Burke.He turned his attention to religion in the \"Age of Reason\" and it remains his most controversial work. While he does briefly discuss Islam (which he calls the \"Turkish\" church), the book is mainly a long polemic against Judeo-Christianity and, especially, a critique of the \"holy\" books of those religions viz. The Old Testament, The New Testament and the Epistles of St. Paul. It is a tour de force and deserves an honored place in the library of those who believe that all the religions of man are human inventions, all are part of human evolution, and none of them have any supernatural content whatsoever.It is better to read Paine in his own words so here, for your edification, are a few \"Gems from the Age of Reason.\" Unfortunately it is only possible to scratch the surface in this short review.Old Testament - \"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more half the bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God.\"Books of Moses -\"The five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are spurious and Moses is not the author of them. Still further, they were not written in the time of Moses, not till several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived; and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of Moses; as men now write histories that heppened, or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago.\"New Testament - \"The presumption is that the books called the evangelists and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and that they are impositions. The disordered state of the history of these four books, the silence of one book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the productions of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called the apostles are supposed to have done.\"Jesus Christ - \"Had it been the object or intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his lifetime. But there is no publication extant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New Testament were written after his death. . . . These books do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes about him. It appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it is only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering questions. . . .From this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years. Where he lived or how he employed himself during this period,is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not apear that he had any school education, and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor.\"St. Paul - \"The character of the person called St Paul, according to the accounts given of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism. He had persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards. The stroke he had received, had changed his thinking wihout altering his constitution; and, either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot. Such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach. They are always in extremes, as well of action as of belief.\"Invented religions - \"All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish appear to me to be no other than human inventions set up to enslave and terrify mankind and monopolize power and profit. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\"Dark Ages - \"Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the Age of Ignorance commenced with the Christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterward.\"Morality - \"As to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered in the old and new testaments they make no part of this pretended thing, revealed religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience and bonds by which society it held together, and without which it cannot exist, and are nearly the same in all religions and all societies. In revealed religion morality is banished to make room for an imaginary thing called faith.\"Mystery - \"the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is the fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion.\"To Thine Own Self Be True - \"I do not condemn those who believe in established religions. They have the right to their beliefs. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.\" Gems from the Age of Reason When I started reading Common Sense I had a hard time because the text was so dense, but when I decided to read it aloud, the text came to life--it was like discovering Shakespeare. Actually, the second set of texts is a collection of about ten essays called \"The American Crisis\" (numbered 1-10), and I thought these were even better. In them Paine tries to convince the American public that Great Britain doesn't have a chance against the 13 Colonies. Sort of like the Iraqi Information Minister telling his people that the Iraqi's will \"roast the American soldier's stomaches in hell\", while American shells explode in the background, shaking the building he's speaking from. The oratory of other greats such as Jim Carvill and Muhammad Ali came to mind, too, but the text is so well written, as to approach Shakespeare.\"These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\"It's almost comical, in retrospect, because he address a few essays directly to the British General in charge, Sir William Howe. To the most powerful general in the world he says, \"England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of a cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier, and by the sample we have taken prisoners we begin to give the preference to ourselves.\"He does make good points, but the abuse, both exaggerated and level-headed, just goes on and on. It was truly a pleasure to read. And even though the pages turned slowly, it just felt good to savor his words.The book is about 800+ pages, so reading the whole collection like a novel is just too much work for most. The varied texts (about 35 in total) are arranged chronollgically, which is nice. Besides Paine's major works, Common Sense, The Crisis, the Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, there is also a nice smattering of smaller essays.Additionally, there are very helpful footnotes in the back of the collection, but there are no numbers within the text; the notes are listed by page and line number.The essays were written about very topical subjects, so it is most helpful to have done a fair amount of general reading before attempting to tackle Paine so you know what he is talking about, though the notes do help. There is also a very nice chronolgy of Paine's life in the back, as well.It was an absolute pleasure reading these primary source texts. I understand now why Common Sense sold 120,000 copies within months of being published and what an essential role Thomas Paine played in keeping up the spirits of the colonists during the very discouraging early years of the War of Independence.A previous reviewer commented on how the high-quality, super-thin pages made the text small, light-weight, and easy to read. I'd have to agree. Excellent choice of texts, very helpful footnotes",

         "1.0",
         "Raising an extremely bright child - quick, curious, sensitive, and introspective - is a daunting challenge. Parents need insight into their own motivations (as well as those of their children), and the courage and ability to make tough decisions about their child's development. \"Raising Gifted Kids\" will help parents understand and cope with the obstacles they face in raising a gifted child, and help them make the best choices for their son's or daughter's growth and happiness. Barbara Schave Klein Family & Relationships",
         "\"Raising Gifted Kids\" was the first book I read that described gifted children, and it did have some interesting insights that got my mind thinking, but I find that overall, I finished the book feeling full of anxiety about what to do with my child. Subsequent books I have read, have given me a fuller picture of the issue and have shed light on the shortcomings of this book. I have a hard time recommending it.This book is filled with anecdotes about gifted children. The stories more or less fall into two patterns. In the \"warning\" stories the pattern is \"Child A was gifted. His parents pushed him too hard. He became a perfectionist, and killed himself as a teenager.\" Or \"Child A was gifted. His parents never challenged him enough. He became frustrated with the difficulties of higher education, so wound up becoming an elementary school teacher (as if that meant his life was a failure)\".The \"success\" stories are generally along the lines of \"Child 'A' was gifted. Her parents hired a psychological advisor, so that they knew the right thing to do. The child became a doctor, and they all lived happily ever after.\" Since the author is one of these psychologist experts, the general emphasis on finding professional help comes across as very self serving. The author's subtle, though persistent implications that some career paths are not worthy of \"gifted\" children comes across as elitist and narrow minded.I have since read a few other gifted children books, and I have learned that there are more or less two camps when it comes to gifted children. There are some who believe that giftedness is an indication that a child has a genetic gift that \"should\" lead that child to grow into a super-achieving adult. This is the type of gifted child model this book talks about. The author puts a lot of emphasis on the idea that if your gifted child doesn't grow up to be an exceptional world changing adult, that somehow the parents have not done a proper job raising the child.The second camp, and the one that the very helpful book \"Being Smart About Gifted Children\" covers well, is that it is often healthier for the child if parents and educators approach giftedness as a temporary state and spend time addressing any current difficulties that a child's giftedness might bring about. For example, if a child is suddenly finding 2nd grade math to be boring, figure out how to make it exciting. To be avoided, though, is to burden a child with a label, just because they happen to be really good at math at a young age. Often it is the case that giftedness does NOT result in a super-achieving adult, and that is perfectly normal. Overly Alarmist Tone Scares Parents More Than Helps Them This book is for anyone who has ever wondered if a child under their care might be gifted, and what to do about it. It's full of affective approaches to a wide range of puzzling, exhausting, and endearing behaviors, and important considerations for educational options. The author has a friendly writing style and is a great source of comfort, confirmation, and inspiration; I will be referring to this book often in the upcoming years. A Must Have for Anyone who's ever wondered... The author uses her expertise in the area of child devlopment and her vast experience working with gifted children and their families to present a reader friendly guide to parenting gifted children. This book is an excellent resource for parents, teachers, school psychologists and principals. Excellent Guide for Parents",

The Tally is an account, historical, critical and functional, of the types cut under Morison's direction during this period. Stanley Morison, Cambridge University Press Language Arts & Disciplines",
         "Typography may be unique among arts in its historical ties to commerce. Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use. If you already appreciate that subtle art, if you want to learn more about its history and practice, this is a very enjoyable way to learn. Visual and historical information",

         "6.0",
         "'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication. Ronald Hutton Body, Mind & Spirit",
         "Answer: What would you like it to be changed into?This is a sympathetic book towards neo-pagans. Ironically, because Hutton does not buy the party line of a pre-historic, nature religion whose tecahings have survived in an unbroken line through family clans, it's not popular with advocates of the matriarchal apostolic succession. In other words, pop Wicca 101 writers hate his guts.A Wicca, in case you haven't got a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary handy is a 'male witch' ( as contrasted with Wicce, a female )However if you've changed your name to Snowflake, Blackjack-for-my-Tribe, or some other Native American or Celtic ..., it's re-defined as someone who practises the 'Craft of the Wise', and to Hades with linguistic analysis. Who do these scholars think they are, anyway?Native American names are popular, since they had a splendid history of women's rights. Celtic ones are also cool, since the Druids were an all male priesthood who, like the Aztecs, practised human sacrifice , but c'mon, those redheaded Irish babes were hot!All Praise to Brigid!Wiccans or Witches are NOT--as they never tire of pointing out to the public--Satanists.Which of course makes absolutely no difference to the majority of Jews, Christians or Muslims, let alone fundamentalist ones; but I imagine it must be a source of great relief to Satanists, who consider Wiccans fluffy, neo-pagans, with atrocious taste in poetry. Hate to to say it, but they've got a point.\"The Charge of the Goddess\", for example, is a watered down ... of Crowley's Egyptian hymn to Nuit. Hutton suggests Wiccans would be better of with the lunar poetry of Shelley, Keats, Graves and other romantics.I hope I'm not making it sound like Hutton is ridiculing anyone;s religion. He's not. He's an old school Brit and goes out of his way to be cordial. It's just that the man IS a historian, so faced with some of the more bizarre claims of 'Traditional Wiccans' his polite response may sound to some hard core believers as if he's punching out the Tooth Fairy in front of a kindergarten class.For example, take the question of how a pagan polytheistic religion, whether invented or re-discovered in England by the likes of Gardner, Sanders, Dion Fortune and company--who were politically somehere to the monarchical right of Attila The Hun, cross over to the USA and become an evangelical, feminist, ecolological and de facto monotheistic (THE Goddess )religion?It's a fascinating historical tour de force by Hutton, a mystery story that weaves the threads of archeology from Sir Arthur Evans in Crete to Mariaja Gimbutas in Anatolia; combining the longings of 19th century Romantic writers--Charlotte Bronte included--to the celebration of Yule and other worldwide nature rites, to the \"Burning Times\"--a wildly revitionist view of the witch trials in medeival Europe--courtesy of Gardner, to the ancient worship of goddesses from Egpypt to Europe who were far more likely to be associated with motherhood, or war, than with rollicking about in the forest, invoking the moon.Perhaps the best defense for a belief in a worlwide Lady and Lord of the Woods pre-historical religion ( where did I put my VHS of 'The Wicker Man'?) comes from the craving of the soul. In a short story by Lovecraft, whose name I can't remember, a man brings an ancient vase to an archeologist who informs him that it's a fraud---no more than a hundred years old. The man counters by telling him that it's even more recent--he painted it himself last night, but the image came to him in a dream, and dreams are older than mankind. Hutton borders on the same point.As Robert Graves observed, though nominally The West is Christian, in actuality, most of us live as if we were ruled by what he called the 'unholy trimverate' of Pluto, god of wealth, Apollo, god of science and Mercury, god of thieves.May The Goddess protect you from having to sell used cars for a living. . . How many Wiccans does it take to change a light bulb? This is a veyr detailed and informative history. However the paperback edition has miniscule print on low grade paper, so much so that it is hard to read for a long period of time. I would reccomend getting the hardback. The work itself is great and it's worth paying the extra to be able to read it without needing aspirin on standby. Excellent work, shame about the typeset. Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job! will it never end!? This book has made me rethink everything I have ever taken as &quot;fact&quot; regarding to Witchcraft. Published in 1999 by the Oxford University Press, this work is clearly held to very high academic standards. The book is divided into two sections, Macrocosm and Microcosm, with subdivisions including &quot;Finding a Goddess&quot;, &quot;Finding a Folklore,&quot; &quot;God (and Goddess) Parents,&quot; &quot;Gerald Gardner,&quot; &quot;Old Craft, New Craft,&quot; &quot;Uncle Sam and the Goddess,&quot; and &quot;Grandchildren of the Shadows.&quot;I mention the above to illustrate the wide context in which this book operates. It not only is interested in historical research devoted to what today's witches term &quot;the burning times,&quot; but also to the development of the modern witchcraft movement begun by Gardner. The manner in which Mr. Hutton presents the material is both academic and yet is readable-- he clearly states when his opinions are just that-- undocumented assumptions based on reason, versus that of proven ideas, thesis, etc. The earlier chapters are a little difficult to &quot;wade through&quot; at times, but the book is more reader friendly with each chapter.The reason Triumph of the Moon is so unique is because it provides facts little known to the general public that refute earlier research on the Witch Trials of the past as well as claims that the Wicca of today is a direct descendant of ancient pagan lineage.Although Mr. Hutton does not align himself with Wicca, Paginsim, or Witchcraft, he has been allowed to study, interview, and even circle with over 21 covens in England.This book is a must read for every Pagan, Wiccan, Witch or anyone interested in history. This is what history books should be printing It will make to re-think everything",

         null,
         "This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation. John E. Hesselgreaves Science",

         "1.0",
         "Are you relentlessly curious and creative, always willing to rock the boat in order to get things done . . . extremely energetic and focused, yet constantly switching gears . . . intensely sensitive, able to intuit subtly charged situations and decipher others' feeling? If these traits sound familiar, then you may be an Everyday Genius--an ordinary person of unusual vision who breaks the mold and isn't afraid to push progress forward. . . . As thought-provoking as Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, psychologist Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's Gifted Adults draws on a wide range of groundbreaking research and her own clinical experience to show America's twenty million gifted adults how to identify and free their extraordinary potential. Gifted Adults presents the first practical tool for rating your Evolutionary Intelligence Quotient through an in-depth personality-type profile. Demystifying what it means to be a gifted adult, this book offers practical guidance for eliminating self-sabotage and underachievement, helping Everyday Geniuses and those who know, love, and work with them to understand and support the exceptional gifts inherent in these unique personality traits. Mary-Elaine Jacobsen Psychology",
         "I agree with the other reviews in that this book is an eye opener if you are not already aware of the 'new' research into giftedness. I would like to make two comments though.First, as one reviewer puts it, the book is lavish on the description of the gifted' characteristics and the difficulties that they encounter in their lives, but is lacking in now-what-do-I do. This is not exactly true. There are many pieces of advice that the author gives on how you can manage those traits that make it so difficult to fit in. However, it takes time for what you've read to sink in. For example, suppose that your social life has not been that great lately and you start feeling depressed. Looking back in time at similar situations, you'd probably decide that you need to make more friends or even find a partner. However, that may not really be the case. It could be that, as the author has so written, you have not been entertaining that necessity of the gifted to have a continual indulging in some kind of interest or passion. As the author puts it, the gifted have `multiple interests' and must always be involved in some kind of pursuit or another. Whenever you feel the blues, turn to the book, look hard and you'd probably find what you're looking for. Most likely, the advice contained in the book can be condensed to fit on just one page; but every single advice is priceless if you take a pause and give it the consideration and time of thought that it needs in order to be effective and long-lasting. The problem is that the book can never substitute for therapy and trying to use it as a manual or workbook is just extremely hard work as is the case with any book anyway. You'd have to be a professional yourself.My second comment is that I find interesting analogies between the Lion sign of western astrology, the Dragon sign of Chinese astrology and the gifted' description. I'd say that these characteristics have been observed throughout the ages and there's nothing really new under the sun except that these traits are now being studied using the 'modern' tools of human psychology.Last, I'd like to say that since it feels very awkward to call yourself gifted, how about `smd' , sensitivity more developed, since the term `hsp' has already been coined. I'd say that the gifted are most different from others in their sensitivity. Like the French say, these people have `une sensibilit&eacute; &agrave; fleur de peau'. To be a `smd' is a way of life and, alas, a constant struggle. Not a manual As a gifted adult myself, this book has helped me understand many aspects of the process of becoming a conscious gifted adult. I've ordered this book for the second time, to share it with a close friend of mine. Instead of being study literature (like 'How the gifted brain learns', which, for other purposes, is another excellent read - mostly if you are teaching or coaching gifted people), the book is mostly full of 'aha-moments' and reads quite easily. I discovered a kind of trajectory in the book, where I naturally found my 'spot'; so there's three 'parts' regarding past, now and future hidden in the book.The first part is mostly recognizing and reframing the past. It describes cases, including the auther herself at some point, about the process from being full of perceptions about yourself (all the typical elements of gifted people are translated into negative views, mostly how non-gifted people perceive the gifted) until realizing how these elements many of us got to dislike or hate in their lives can be qualities.The second part, including the Evolutionary Intelligence model, contains some tools to get more insight into your personal development needs. This felt for me as the 'now'.Also, the author describes how she got to do work that connects directly to her soul calling, or life mission, or personal passion as you will. A life-changing insight for me, which I found also in other books, is that with the current world-wide crisis it is no wonder that more gifted and talented people are being born. Finding our way, creating coaching and therapy for gifted people (and recognizing all the misdiagnosis going on, because of ADHD and other mental disorders in DSM-IV but no good, 'official' literature on giftedness and its effects) but also transforming our educational systems and training human resource departments at big companies, is essential to help the planet in her process. For me this is the future, I don't feel I have the role that connects exactly to this, but the call is getting stronger. So, since they say 'patience is a virtue', I train myself in taking my time. Not everything has to be finished yesterday? Aha! ;-) Enlightening book In an article in Advanced Development journal, Mary-Elaine Jacobsen noted the typical stereotypes of gifted people include the \"temperamental artist, or the pathetic isolate whose brainy abilities are lost in foolishness, alcoholism or chronic depression,\" and the glittering superstar in the arts or sciences with talents elevating them [more or less effortlessly] to \"an unreachable pedestal of human achievement.\"One of the great values of her book is in showing how more ordinary people with exceptional abilities and sensitivities face challenges in, first of all, recognizing themselves, then realizing their multiple talents.All too often, gifted adults [and children] get labeled as being problematical or pathological. Her book helps to better understand a range of gifted personality traits that can be embraced and used for living a more authentic and fulfilling life. living more fully as an exceptional person This is a review of the book \"Liberating Everday Genius\" by Jacobsen; I'm not sure if this book is the same under another name or if this new book offers more than the older version previously published.I read this book in hopes that it would actually teach me how to liberate my creativity and intelligence. Unfortunately, most of what it offers is mere information and theory regarding what \"everyday genius\" is and how to tell if you are one using a rather generic \"test.\" It then goes on to dispel myths and stereotypes that most \"geniuses\" seem to experience. I know that I found a lot of myself in this book although I'm not sure I'd call myself a genius. Perhaps I overestimate what the term really means, thus fitting in to the descriptions she gives of how society pushes down anyone who thinks differently than the majority. Sadly, none of my big questions were answered such as, \"how do I overcome this programming?\" I am just as confused and feel just as alone as I did prior to reading the book, so I can't say it has been any help to me except to point out that maybe there are others out there like me. What's the point if I still feel too lost to find them and to express my \"true\" self? Much of the material is repetitive in that she presents the same ideas and concepts over and over again. I assume she's trying to drill it into the head of the reader, but perhaps it's just book filler. I think she could have compacted the material into a book half the original size, thus lowering the price in the process. If you buy it, expect to be reading a Tony Robbins type self-esteem booster...do not expect to find real answers. Nice for self-esteem, but where are the answers? This is definitely best of (not many) books for gifted adults (of books not focused only on gifted children). Absolutely informative, describing everything from stories to theory and personality traits behind giftedness. There is no other book at the same level of information and help for gifted adults. I agree with other reviews - if you expect this book will give you ultimate answers and ready-made solutions to adapt to your life, you will be disappointed. It is better to expect this book to be interesting inquiry into the soul of gifted people, with several ideas what to do and what to change in your lifestyle, however you will stay alone with final decisions and this book can be inspiration for creating more ideas for changing your lifestyle. Chapters of practical help (managing gifted adult life) are not the strongest point of the book. Generally they advise you - do not be either too extreme, or too inhibited in showing up your traits. Learn to balance your self- expression. No more ideas... However you (as probably gifted adult) do not expect one book with all solutions to your life, do you? This book is definitely a must for everybody who is lost, is trying to orient, or trying to get more information about giftedness in adult people. Week points - 1) It is sometimes too repetitive and wordy, 2) Concepts like \"Evolutionary Intelligence\" or \"Everyday genius\" are useless, confusing and presented probably with understandable intention of the author to suggest new theory, however these concepts are not elaborated well and sound too \"new age\". Up-to-date psychological terminology would be sufficient. Still, five stars are absolutely fair for this book. Best from available books, do not expect ultimate solutions",

As stated by Derrida, &quot;every drawing of 'the blind' is a drawing 'of' the blind.&quot; More than just an example of applied deconstruction, Derrida's reading of these drawings questions the very foudnation of western ideologies of 'looking' and 'seeing' taken for granted as self-evident by artists for centuries. By the end, one wonders who is the author, the artist, the curator?, as Derrida does more with these drawings 'for drawing' than they ever did for drawing themselves.

         "This is an excellent brief work on Prof. Jay's system. Although the book is comparatively short, at least 50 and probably more like 100 techniques are shown. Techniques are divided between throws, wrist locks, elbow locks, leglocks, and finger locks. Vulnerable areas of the body and how to attack them are shown also.Another nice feature is Prof. Jay discusses his overall theory of jujitsu and mechanical and martial principles involved, of which there are 10, which he goes into in some detail. Some of these will not be new to any experienced martial artist, such as the importance of balance, but others, such as his push-pull method of doing holds and locks, may be new.Of course one can't learn a martial art from a book, but if you have some previous knowledge, this book is an excellent introduction and/or review of many of the techniques in Prof. Jay's system. The system I practice has enough overlap so that I found this book a great way to reference and learn somemore about it. I've also had the opportunity to attend two of Prof. Jay's seminars over the years, and would like to say they were great as I expected, and it was a honor to finally meet and get to learn from such a great teacher. And he has put a lot of that knowledge into this book. Excellent brief volume on the system Wally Jay is an original, as well as a Hall of Fame martial arts instructor. This book must be one of the 5 or 10 best martial arts books available. It includes 11 wrist locks, 7 finger locks, 10 arm locks, 5 leg locks, 17 throws, 11 chokes, and 45 self defense moves against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs, and arm bars. The step by step explanations are clear, and the large photos are helpful. All you need is a willing partner and you are well on your way to learning Wally Jay's awesome fighting system based on a simple twist of the wrist. A simple twist of the wrist can subdue a stronger opponent This book is great! It shows several techniques using Wally Jay's Small-Circle theory that work effectively and can be learned quickly. This book is great for people who have experience in the fighting arts or for people who don't. The techniques are clearly described with easy-to-follow, step-by-step illustrations. I highly recommend this book, one of the best martial arts books I've read!! AN EXCELLENT BOOK!! I Like this book. I think that is great for introduction to Jujitsu as well as a supplementing reference to jujitsu for one who is already practicing the martial art. The techniques covered in the book do work for appropriate situations. While no martial art is so complete as to deal with every conflict situation in which one may find oneself, Small Circle Jujitsu offers a good range of techniques to deal with many common assault scenarios. Small Circle Jujitsu Offers the defender the potential advantage of achieving control over an attacker with minimum effort and an option of not causing injury to attacker once he has been subdued. Karate, Kung Fu, and Boxing do not have these optional advantages.All the technigues are labled, described and explained in english as opposed to many other books which label techniques in Japanese. I think that this serves well the beginning student of Jujitsu who may know nothing of Japanese language or culture; but may still want to learn an efficient means of self defense. I suspect that the use of Japanese terminology in an English culture might even intimidate many prospective Jujitsu students from ever taking up the martial art simply because they cannot even pronounce the words.The book itself is divided into 5 chapters. Beginning students should pay attention to the rules of safety included towards the front of the book. This is because some of the techniques can cause serious injury.Topics covered in the book include falls, exercises, resuscitation, weak points of the body, wrist locks, finger locks, arm bars, arm locks, leg locks, throwing techniques, chokes, as well as defenses against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs.The explanations and pictures of techniques are easy to follow and understand.I think one of the things that make this book such a good value is because the reader also has the option of buying a series of videos and DVD's by the same title and author which show the student the motion and application of smooth, continous transition of techniques which cannot be captured by still pictures and explanatory text. The DVD's can be played back in slow motion which is a learning advantage in any sport. The VHS videos and DVD's can be bought from Amazon.com or direct from Black Belt Magazine at WWW.Blackbeltmag.com.Videos and DVD's can be bought separately or as a complete set. Black Belt Magazine sometimes offers the whole set of 5 VHS tapes or DVD's at the price of 4 tapes or DVD's. Look for the offer if interested.I give this book and the videos 5 each stars because it is evident that Professor Wally Jay really invested much time and effort into making sure that students will be able to understand and make use of the contents of the book and videos of Small Circle Jujitsu as a means of an efficient and effective means of self defence.Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 1 - FoundationsSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 3 - Grappling TechniquesSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and ArmlocksNihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 1Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 2Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 5Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-DefenseChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12 This is a great Jujitsu book.

Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to.

Even if you have never been to that country nor know a lot of the history the story is gripping. The relations between the various women are beautifully drawn and are good and interesting enough to overcome the sometimes tedious effort to tell the history of the country. The book contains many jewels of small and simple things people do for and with each other. The letter of Caecilia at the end of the book is an example of absolute literary beauty and I will not forget that scene for a long time.In the best traditions of Isabel Allende and G.G.Marquez.

         "\"A set of ancient inscriptions on marble found forty years ago in southern Italy, recording details so bewildering that scholars have kept silent about them ... Sensational new information about a group of ancient philosophers who were so intensely practical that, two and a half thousand years ago, they shaped our existence and the world we live in ... These are just two ingredients of this extraordinary book, which uncovers an astonishing reality right at the origins of the Western world. Written by one of the most highly-acclaimed contemporary historians and experts in the field, it provides dramatic new evidence about the most important of ancient philosophers, Parmenides—and revolutionizes our understanding of the history of religion, of the origins of philosophy, and of Western culture as a whole.\"-- Peter Kingsley Body, Mind & Spirit",
         "This book reads like a mystery story, or rather a story aboutmystery. It is based on solid academic scholarship, but is by no meanswritten in an academic style. Rather, it is a highly personal account of the author's discoveries about a famous Greek philosopher, Parmenides, and the philosopher's surprising secret. A philosopher whom thousands of years of academic scholarship and philosophy regarded as a dry logician, turns out to be the representative of an authentic Mediterranean tradition of mystical practice. Kingsley's writing takes on an almost religious intensity in places; he writes like a man with a vision, trying to awaken those who have suppressed or forgotten their own spiritual connections. DARK PLACES OF WISDOM is something that can transcend the seminars and the classrooms, reaching out to spiritual searchers who are sick of the banalities of our society and are questing for a more direct experience of the divine. According to Kingsley, this is how that quest, and that experience, was done back in the Sicilian colonies of ancient Greece, 2500 years ago. And that tradition that Kingsley discovers, has been hidden in the depths of our Western culture and consciousness ever since. If you want an adventure which is both intellectual AND mystical, try this book. END A journey to the roots of the Western mystical tradition Like other reviewers, I found Kingsley's style irritating and almost condescending, as though he were an explorer of great experience and wisdom trying to convey something of the sense of wonder to people who are not very capable of understanding specifics. However, he did hit upon one thing that is VERY important -- but I see no sign that he himself understood what it meant.Kingsley talks about the iatromantis guiding people lying in dark caves - and seems to think it has something to do with them preparing themselves for their eventual death. But I don't think it was that at all. When I read that I thought, \"these people are doing what we did at the Monroe Institute - depriving the senses of input to make it easier to concentrate on inner images so that they could learn to experience and use unusual mental states at will.\" I expect they went through specific exercises in those dark spaces, probably accompanied with some rhythmic background sound, as shamanism uses.Kingsley is perhaps too enmeshed in the academic mindset to realize that these people were having a real experience that we today can share. Of course my guess may be wrong, but it is part of the value of Kingsley's book that it gives rise to just such speculations.I give it a one for style and a 5 for content, so the result is a three. Irritating style, but a valuable insight After so many positive reviews I was excited to get and read this book. I have to say I'm disappointed. Firstly, it feels like the tone and approach Kingsley uses is geared towards children or teenagers; it's strange. Frankly, I don't like his use of the English language, I find it stilted. I kept thinking--get to the point, man.He's trying to do a couple of things at once, so far as I could see: create a kind of suspense story with the discovery of some statues with inscriptions on it and also to lay out what Parmenides was &lt;really> saying. I wasn't interested in the first aim--and I could barely follow his \"conclusions.\" As far as the second, well... it doesn't sound all that different than what one can glean from the Upanishads or the Tao Te Ching or Chuang Tzu. But Kingsley posits it as the \"missing key\" in a sense.It is missing a glossary; and with a totally jumbled up \"references\" section it's very hard to know where he got his information. I appreciate his effort but I think he took himself a little too seriously. Not So Kingly",

         "THE DHARMA BUMS appeared just one year after the author's explosive ON THE ROAD had put the Beat Generation on the literary map and Kerouac on the best-seller list. The same expansiveness, humour and contagious zest for life that sparked the earlier novels sparks this one too, but through a more cohesive story. The books follow two young men engaged in a passionate search for dharma or truth. Their major adventure is the pursuit of the Zen way, which takes them climbing into the high sierras to seek the lesson of solitude. With an Introduction by Kerouac expert, Ann Douglas. Jack Kerouac Fiction",
         "Needed this for a college class and money was tight and not having to pay the bookstore price really helped. Thank you. Needed Better than `On The Road' (not putting it down). This is a truly amazing book. If you are hesitating about buying it, I assure you it will be money very well spent. You can't help but love this guy; he possesses the most beautifully innocent, intelligent, honest mind. Pack your bag and head for the hills. Read all of his books. King of Beat plays on your escapist side once again 'The Dharma Bums' is a tale of social dropouts in California who search for Buddhist enlightenment and truth (dharma) amid wine, sex, hitchhiking and mountain scenery. It's a good introduction to Kerouac - shorter, lighter and more accessible than On the Road, which is a more epic but also has some monotonous bits.If religious certainties turn you off, you might tire of dharma-bum narrator Ray's Buddhist slogans and the dogmatic Zen views of Japhy, Ray's buddy. But though Kerouac portrays Buddhism as liberating, he also laughs a lot at kooky piety. At some points - like Ray's 'banana sermon' - religion becomes either profound or hilarious, or both.Ray tries to reach nirvana by convincing himself the world's an illusion, which makes it ironic that the best bits in this novel are poetic descriptions of mountains and travel. The final lonely mountain-top vigil - based on Kerouac's experience as a fire lookout, described in Lonesome Traveller - is a tour de force. Kerouac's prose flair allows him to string 10 adjectives in front of a noun, a heinous crime in modern writing fashion, and get away with it.Kerouac balances Ray and Japhy's Buddhist belief that the world is illusory against the earthbound views of world-weary poet Alvah Goldbook, a thinly veiled Allen Ginsberg. Alvah's quest to soak up his surroundings rather than transcend them puts him closer to the philosophy of On the Road, in which the travelling bums reach a jubilant but sad-hearted state of raw appreciation of their phsyical world.Through the Ray-Japhy-Alvah triangle and all the minor characters, 'The Dharma Bums' gives various answers to Kerouac's big question in this and other books: how to lead a free existence in a conformist careerist consumerist society. Fifty years later, the question's got more vital. Youthful rebellion and boheme are just marketing motifs for soft drinks, CDs and snowboards now, but Kerouac shows you it's possible to be authentically free - if you have the guts. A light-hearted mix of religious lunacy and zest for nature Following the success of \"On the Road\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \"The Subterraneans\" and \"Tristessa.\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \"On the Road.\" Kerouac responded with \"The Dharma Bums\" which was published late in 1958. \"The Dharma Bums\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole. The book was critiqued by Allen Ginsberg and others close to Kerouac as a \"travelogue\" and as over-sentimentalized. But with the exception of \"On the Road\", \"The Dharma Bums\" remains Kerouac's most widely read work. I had the opportunity to reread \"The Dharma Bums\" and came away from the book deeply moved.As are all of Kerouac's novels, \"The Dharma Bums\" is autobiographical. It is based upon Kerouac's life between 1956--1957 -- before \"On the Road\" appeared and made Kerouac famous. The book focuses upon the relationship between Kerouac, who in the book is called Ray Smith and his friend, the poet Gary Snyder, called Japhy Ryder, ten years Kerouac's junior. Kerouac died in 1969, while Snyder is still alive and a highly regarded poet. Allen Ginsberg (Alvah Goldbrook) and Neal Cassady (Cody Pomeray), among others, also are characters in the book. Most of the book is set in San Francisco and its environs, but there are scenes of Kerouac's restless and extensive travelling by hitchiking, walking, jumping freight trains, and taking buses, as he visits Mexico, and his mother's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the course of the book.The strenght of \"The Dharma Bums\" lies in its scenes of spiritual seriousness and meditation. During the period described in the book, Kerouac had become greatly interested in Buddhism. He describes himself as a \"bhikku\" -- a Buddhist monk -- and had been celibate for a year when the book begins. I have been studying Buddhism myself for many years, and it is easy to underestimate Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism. As with many authors, he was wiser in his writing that he was in his life. There is a sense of the sadness and changeable character of existence and of the value of compassion for all beings that comes through eloquently in \"The Dharma Bums.\" Smith and Ryder have many discussions about Buddhism -- at various levels of seriousness -- during the course of the novel. Ryder tends to use Buddhism to be critical of and alienated from American society and its excessive materialism and devotion to frivolity such as television. Smith has the broader vision and sees compassion and understanding as a necessary part of the lives of everyone. Smith tends to be more meditative and quiet in his Buddhist practice -- he spends a great deal of time in the book sitting and \"doing nothing\" while Ryder is generally active and on the go, hiking, chopping wood, studying, or womanizing. At the end of the book, he leaves for an extended trip to Japan. (He and Kerouac would never see each other again.)\"The Dharma Bums\" offers a picture of a portion of American Buddhism during the 1950s. It also offers a portrayal of what has been called the \"rucksack revolution\" as Smith and Ryder take to the outdoors, and, in a lengthy and famous section of the book, climb the \"Matterhorn\" in California's Sierra Mountains. In the final chapters of the book, Kerouac spends eight isolated weeks on Desolation Peak in the Cascades as a fire watchman. He comes back yearning for human company.Sexuality plays an important role in the book, against the backdrop of what is described as the repressed 1950's, as young girls are drawn to Ryder and he willingly shares them with an initially reluctant Smith. The book includes scenes of wild parties tinged, for Smith, with sadness, in which people of both sexes dance naked, get physically involved, and drink heavily. Near the end of the book, Ryder offers Smith a prophetic warning the alcoholism which would shortly thereafter ruin Kerouac's life.\"The Dharma Bums\" is a fundamentally American book and it is full of love for the places of America, for the opportunity it offers for spiritual exploration, and for its people. Kerouac's compassion was hard earned. In his introduction to a later book, \"The Lonesome Traveller\" heaptly described his books as involving the \"preachment of universal kindness, which hysterial critics have failed to notice beneath frenetic activity of my true-story novels about the 'beat' generation. -- Am actually not 'beat' but strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic.\" I found a feeling of spirituality, of love of life in the face of vicissitudes, and of America in \"The Dharma Bums.\" The work was indeed a popularization. But Kerouac's vision may ultimately have been broad.Robin Friedman The Dharma Bums Man, I don't know where to start. \"The Dharma Bums\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \"Wail\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \"Howl\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic.While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \"The Dharma Bums\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again. Worth every penny! Dealing with Amazon was so easy, this was my first time buying from this site and it was so easy,quick and was delivered very fast. Great Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing. Kerouac is not that great Yes, &quot;On The Road&quot; gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; soars as high as &quot;Big Sur&quot; dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors. Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it! Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer. It made me want to live my life without shackles, free like Kerouac's character Japhy (Gary Snyder), climbing mountains and writing poetry. It captures the Boho 50's era like no other, especially in the Bay Area. Finally, it inspired me to learn more about Buddhism and eventually spend a year in a Buddhist monastery. I've never met someone who has read The Dharma Bums and hasn't loved it. It's one of the best books of the 20th century.By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha Kerouac's Best OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac. One show about nothing is enough Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer.

It's one of the best books of the 20th century.By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha Kerouac's Best Having heard me praise this book countless times, my wife finally read it for herself. Her response? \"You know, I was expecting some stereotype of `cool' Beatniks, trying to be so hip and detached. But that's just some popular media image. The people in this book are exuberant, thoughtful, even spiritual!\" That sums it up as well as anything. Forget the glib idea of alterna-cultural one-upmanship that passes for a Beat attitude these days - \"The Dharma Bums\" is about nave exuberance, anything-but-ironic soul-searching, an eager exploration of life's sorrows and joys, and the sheer, exhilarating, wondrous zest of being alive and aware in an endlessly fresh world. If reading this clear mountain stream of a book doesn't make you want to change your life and your way of looking at life, then you're just hopelessly blind to something precious! Life is so much more than the neatly packaged, pre-imagined commercial that society would love to sell you, and \"The Dharma Bums\" will gladly show you one possible way of finding your true path. Life is great! Length:: 4:02 Mins Dharma Bums I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands. On the Dharma Road I have just finished this book and really enjoyed the written word. It has a free flowing style which is mesmerising and relaxing to read. I am old enough to remember the times it was written in and they were very optomistic and free.However I was reading the book in 2012 and times have changed. The materalistic world has engulfed us and freedom and free thinking seem to be things of the past. The drug culture is now feared and grave consequences of participation in it are promoted.Perhaps sadly all I can say is that the bubble has burst. A great book for its time",

         "2.0",
         "This book is a simple, easy-to-read guide to debunking health scares and scams before you get hurt. Steven J. Milloy Reference",
         "Hardly a day can pass without hearing about some new threat to our health from something in our food or in the air that we breathe. In his lively style, Steven J. Milloy has written a &quot;self-defense guide&quot; to help the average consumer know when to be alarmed or when to proceed with life as usual.Junk Science Judo is filled with examples of questionable conclusions drawn from data from a wide variety of sources. Milloy relates how zealous lawyers can draw false or misleading inferences from scientific data in order to extract large rewards from lawsuits against defendants with deep pockets, often with collaboration from those in the &quot;scientific&quot; community who stand to profit from their &quot;research&quot; (what better way to justify large government grants to continue research into some promising area?). Most telling are the cases of the lawsuits involving breast implants and Agent Orange, where a total absence of evidence was ignored by courts and juries eager to punish unpopular defendants and to reward those who were definitely disadvantaged (but probably not as a result of either the implants or Agent Orange).Despite a generally good job of writing a primer on how not to be taken in by faulty conclusions or misleading inferences of cause and effect, Chapter 11 of this book contains one significantly dubious conclusion of the author himself. In a discussion of the statistical technique of meta-analysis (a technique where the results of numerous small studies are combined to simulate one large study), Milloy repeatedly takes stabs at this respected technique. His criticisms appear to be based mainly on questions raised in an editorial in a medical journal where the editor cited poor data quality and publication bias (i.e., only research studies showing significant results tend to get published) as reasons for questioning conclusions from meta-analysis. Although the editor is correct, it does not follow that all meta-analysis is therefore useless. Given enough well-executed studies without bias in the findings, meta-analysis can be a very useful and enlightening tool.I highly recommend that all consumers of information either purchase this book or at least borrow it from someone, and read it thoroughly. I suspect that you will never again be able to read uncritically any account of some purported new crisis brought on by zealous lawyers, journalists or politicians. When some &quot;scientific&quot; conclusion appears to be counterintuitive, it is most likely incorrect. Subsequent research may, in fact, show that the conclusions were incorrect, but (since this is not exciting) the correction is likely not to be brought to the public's attention. Since it is impossible to prove a negative, the burden of proof should be on the scientific community to exercise caution in releasing insignificant findings to the press. Junk science may sell newspapers or gain an audience for the evening news, but it is devastating when it causes major disruptions in the lives of people who either aren't given the whole picture or who can't interpret the information when it is presented.The best defense against junk science is an informed public. Read this book and you will definitely become better informed! Self-defense for Consumers Steven Milloy is the self proclaimed \"director\" of The Advancement for Sound Science Coalition also known as TASSC. This coalition is a think tank for corporate interests. The objective of the TASSC is to debunk modern scientific research that concludes corporate pollution has serious consequences on he environment.So Steven's objective is to discredit any scientific findings that come to the conclusion that corporate America's pollution has now and will continue to have global effects on the environment. So he criticizes the results of real scientists that are doing objective research and labels them as radical liberals. He calls their science \"junk science\" .The only slip in reasoning here is that the scientists that conclude big business pollution is destructive to the environment and our health weren't paid by billion dollar Industries to come to these conclusions.Steven Milloy and TASSC are funded gratuitously by corporate America to debunk global warming and any other scientific findings that run counter to corporate America's interests.Originally TASSC was funded by Philip Morris with the goal of debunking the scientific conlusion that second hand smoke is hazardous to your health. Would you believe that? If I was paid a million dollars by Phillip Morris to say second hand smoke is not dangerous to your health would you believe me? I really hope not. But that is just what Steven Milloy does. He gets paid enormously by corporate America to say that environmental scientists (who weren't paid off to come to specific conclusions) are the one's producing the junk science. His original funding came from Phillip Morris but TASSC is funded by the following corporations: 3M, Amoco, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Motors, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lorillard Tobacco, Louisiana Chemical Association, National Pest Control Association, Occidental Petroleum, Philip Morris Companies, Procter & Gamble, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and W.R. Grace, the asbestos and pesticide manufacturers.If you think I'm making this all up do a Google search on \"Steven J. Milloy Spin doctoring\" or \"Steven J. Milloy Phillip Morris\" and see all of the legitimate resources that expose his true ulterior motives. That is, if you actually do care about the truth more than you care about not being labeled as a liberal radical.The name calling is how these billion dollar corporations enforce compliance by labeling dissenters as deviants. If you care about the environment you are a bleeding heart liberal, if you don't support the United States occupation and Halliburton's profiteering in Iraq you are unpatriotic and sometimes even considered a terrorist. These God and Jesus spewing billionaires define right and wrong and what is moral according to their own interests. They will pay pseudo scientists like Steven J. Milloy enormous sums of money to make it appear that there is scientific evidence to support their agenda. The King of Junk Science",

         "The story of the woman taken in adultery features a dramatic confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees over whether the adulteress should be stoned as the law commands. In response, Jesus famously states, “Let him who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” To Cast the First Stone traces the history of this provocative story from its first appearance to its enduring presence today. Likely added to the Gospel of John in the third century, the passage is often held up by modern critics as an example of textual corruption by early Christian scribes and editors, yet a judgment of corruption obscures the warm embrace the story actually received. Jennifer Knust and Tommy Wasserman trace the story’s incorporation into Gospel books, liturgical practices, storytelling, and art, overturning the mistaken perception that it was either peripheral or suppressed, even in the Greek East. The authors also explore the story’s many different meanings. Taken as an illustration of the expansiveness of Christ’s mercy, the purported superiority of Christians over Jews, the necessity of penance, and more, this vivid episode has invited any number of creative receptions. This history reveals as much about the changing priorities of audiences, scribes, editors, and scholars as it does about an “original” text of John. To Cast the First Stone calls attention to significant shifts in Christian book cultures and the enduring impact of oral tradition on the preservation—and destabilization—of scripture.

         "A well-written guide to enterprise risk management from somebody who knows it first hand. The book covers all of the relevant topics within ERM: concepts and processes, governance, risk transfer, analytics, risk types, and applications to the business (lessons learned, case studies, etc.).The book is tilted towards banking and energy and could use an update on how ERM has become vogue among corporations in almost every other sector. It could also include more information on operational risk and Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, as well as more recent info on the topic from leading risk organizations and projects (COSO and others). It is not a one stop shop on the subject - hence just four stars.If you have a chance to work with risk managers and/or risk consultants, see the latest dashboard tools, or sit in on risk assessment and ranking exercises, I believe you'll get much more from the book. There is a lot of \"dot-connecting\" that needs to go on with ERM.And a special endorsement...I once received a very attractive offer from a leading Fortune 500 company for an enterprise risk manager position. I had just a little experience with ERM, but I used material from this book to get me through six probing interviews. Very few books can help a candidate quite the way this one helped me. Definitely Worth a Read This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author&iexcl;s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management.

Being guided by \"Setting Up Shop ...\" I am gaining from wonderful ideas and the author's tested experience. I recommend this book to anyone who is, or dreams of, setting up shop. The woodworking shop of my dreams I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However, like most books on this topic, it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop, working in a shed, basement, attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop, but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective. Practical advise for setting up a woodworking shop I just had the final electrical installed in my shop so my shop was just about done when I found this book. Parts of this book that pointed out where I did things correctly, parts of the book point out where I should go from here.I've found that there was some good information here, but I think the best information comes from looking at the pictures of other people's shops. How do they arrange their workbenches in relation to their tool boxes, how do they store their clamps, how do they store their wood, etc.Overall, I think Taunton Press's &quot;The Workshop Book&quot; is a better resource for these kinds of ideas. This book is nice, but The Workshop Book goes into much more detail. There's good stuff here if you search for it Recieved in Good Condition. Setting Up Shop: The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well. Not worth it",

In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

         "Many Latin teachers are recognizing the benefits of approaching Latin as a means of communication in the classroom, thus tapping into students' natural language learning faculties, making the learning process more enjoyable and productive. Many Latin teachers are also frustrated with the lack of resources by means of which they could provide their students with vocabulary for expressing themselves.I and other teachers have spent much time compiling such vocabularies from diverse and/or obscure sources. This text, however, provides most of that informaiton in a fun, accessible, and affordable text. The book is organized into 25 short chapters, each addressing. everyday situations, from meals, to the home, to telling time. Also, the latin is decent. Any teacher who already uses latin communicatively will inevitably want to make a few changes, but this is more a matter of preference than accuracy.This is not a substitute for a high-school or college Latin textbook. It should be used as a companion or supplement. Whether one's goal is teaching Latin for communication or for reading (or some combination of the two), there is no doubt that students will \"buy in\" more if they possess the tools to express themselves and their world in the language. This book will help.www.johnpiazza.net very useful companion text",

By the author of the Tripods trilogy. Simultaneous and eBook. John Christopher Juvenile Fiction",
         "First, i come to this book as an extended directed self study on the issues involved in the Creation-Evolution-Design debate. This book i rate as one of the 5 most significant books for a conservative reformed Christian who wants to come to reasoned and faithful conclusions in the CED debate. It is conservative which i define to be conscious and considerate of the traditions of the past, to take them seriously, not simply accepting something because it is new. It is Biblical in the way the author is very careful to allow the Scripture's Words to speak for themselves, being very careful not to read into the words his own cherished beliefs, but to allow the Word to speak to him, authoritatively and reliably. To this end he is not infected by the liberal J-P-D documentary interpretation so often evident in exegesis or interpretation.Second, the book is significant on two levels, the first is the exegetical level, the principles of understanding that the author explores in the first few chapters. Second is the line by line study that forms the bulk of the book, roughly chpt 3 on.The structure of the book is that of Gen 1-3 but the way he writes is interesting and worth a moment of reflection here. The chapters are more like consistent essays than the usual exegesis bound to the text. He takes a major theme in the next section of Genesis then expands it to cover this issue through the past interpreters and links to other related Scripture. It roughly follows the systematic organization of reformed covenant theology.pg 26 has what i think is the best analysis of the human writers relationship to Scripture. &quot;That rule follows from the humanity of Holy Scripture. In the act of inspiration God did not turn his sookesmen into robots; his Word became their word, under their signature and their responsiblility. Thus we have no right to go over their heads in order to set forth a 'divine' meaning which they would never possilby have imagined-even if those men did not grasp the whole import of what they attested God in his condescension has limited himself to their instrumentality; our interpretation must conform to the corresponding discipline.&quot;If the church would hend this advice much of the CED debate would be solved, for we would cease to search Genesis for the equivalent of quarks, trying to query the first few chapters of the Bible and mine it for scientific truths. Rather we would, as this author does, submit to the authority of Scripture to speak to the way we do science, to the ideas that we bring to the universe as we question the master workmen's creation that we are a small part of.The book is literary framework in its approach to Gen1-3, M. Kline being the best example of this in the english speaking world. Anyone familiar with the CED issues would be advised to read the first 2 chapters of this book simply to see a careful analysis of exegesis and the result of allowing Scripture to speak for itself rather than being pushed out of shape by young earth creationists whom would interpret the 7 days too literally. Or by scientific reconcilationists would would try to find modern science confirmed in the light appearing before the sun(ie the big bang).The first principle he outlines carefully is to allow Scripture to speak to its first listeners, their culture, their history. His exegetical task doesn't end there but extends to teaching what these things mean to us in our place in space and time. But this application, this preaching follows critical-historical interpretation not prior to it as so many would desire.Thanks to the author for this excellent book and i hope to read more from his pen. conservative thoughtful Biblical exegesis of Gen 1-3",

         "Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge. A taut masterwork of World War II historical fiction by bestselling author James Clavell. James Clavell Fiction",
         "We should be really grateful for the strike that prevented Clavell to work as a screenplay writer and director for a few weeks in the early sixties and led them to write his first novel. In this edition there is a nice prologue by his daughter explaining what prompted him to write this book, and how quickly he wrote it. The novel is a fictionalized retelling of Clavell's experiences in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore.Clavell does an amazing job in describing the personalities of the different characters that take part in the story. The fact that the camp held American, English and Australian prisoners provided him with the opportunity to showcase his acute understanding of the different cultures. If you add on top of that the Japanese and the locals that were in charge of managing the camp, you will find a wealth of characters that make this a mesmerizing read. There are two characters though, that are at the center of this tale, and whose actions could serve as a study in sociology. One is an American, the King, who is a corporal that has the ability to facilitate commerce, which is prohibited by camp rules, and therefore makes a very nice living, especially when compared with everyone else. When the King meets Peter Marlowe, a British Lieutenant, the contrast of personalities and moral codes could not be clearer. Thus starts an unusual friendship that will test Marlowe's character and convictions, since he will have to decide between compromising his morals in return for better living conditions for him and his friends, and sticking to his guns and keep on living miserably.One thing that you can tell as soon as you start reading this novel, and that is confirmed later, is that Clavell is an excellent narrator and has a gift for describing characters and give them a soul. This helps understand how he can hold the reader's attention without it wavering in lengthy novels likeShogun. In this case, the parts that deal with the secret commerce help provide the story with variety, because they speed up the pace and change the tone. It is also interesting that this edition includes the passages related to the situation of those left behind, mainly wives and kids. These provide additional insights into the lives of the prisoners, helping us understand their motivations and behavior better.In summary, this can only be defined as an excellent read. Although it has some scenes that may be hard on some readers for their brutality, I believe that the great majority of people will love it. \"Changi was genesis, the place of beginning again\" After reading Shogun I was hungry for anything written by Clavell and went on to read King Rat (which was also made into a movie that I found to be quite good). Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read. I highly recommend it and would have given it 4 1/2 stars if allowed. A very good read James Clavell's \"King Rat\" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a \"gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon\" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero? Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway? Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: \"Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting.\" Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned. It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes\" (of TV sitcom fame). Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has \"no stomach for war\" and comes close to saying \"I know nothing-Nothing!\" Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, \"I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book. I was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin. King Rat the Worst of the Clavell Saga A very good read, this novel is more \"complex\" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it. A significant change from Noble House Saga I read all of the James Clavell novels recently and enjoyed them tremendously. I learned so much about the Oriental mind and culture. I started reading King Rat thinking it would be on the same vein. At first, I thought I would stop reading it because it was about a prisoner camp but I am so happy that I persisted through the end. James Clavell's novel is such a great study of the human mind and soul. I learned a great deal and thought the novel was very thought provoking. King Rat the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl king rat Warning: this is a disturbing book. It is gripping and enthralling, but horrifying. It shows men being tested to the utmost, and the many bad qualities this brings out. But it also shows true friendship and cooperation against adversity.Clavell truly brings to life a POW camp of Englishmen and Americans (captives of the Japanese) and the horrors they were subject to. Men help each other survive, but also betray each other, and are jealous of each other's success. The King, an American soldier, is especially envied because he is extremely skilled at trading and making deals. He and the Englishman Peter Marlowe are the main characters, but there are also stories of other men and how they survive.The ending is perhaps the most frightening part of the whole book. The prisoners are freed at the end of WWII, and as they leave the camp, they must learn to be part of the world again, and not the world they created. I won't spoil anything more. For anyone who can handle its intensity, \"King Rat\" is an eye-opening read. Not For the Faint at Heart If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House. Outstanding! The smallest of the Asia series focuses sharply into a POW camp in Singapore during WWII. Unlike the other installments of the series this is intensely intimate and the author does a great job expressing the feelings and agony of survival in the camp. With the constant specter of death in its many forms (tropical diseases, betrayal and starvation) hang over these men you can't help but get involved in there tale. Tight and Dreary Over the years I have reread this one several times and continue to be fastinated with this particular work. I, myself, feel this has gained \"classic\" status and eventhough I hate the term \"a must read,\" but certainly feel this book falls into that category. The work graphically shows just what people will do when faced with circumstances completely out of their control. Recommend this read for any serious student of literature, history, miliary or otherwise, or psychology as well as those simply looking for a very good read. ONE YOU WILL WANT TO REREAD First of all this is the first book I have read by James Clavell and I really enjoyed it. Some of my first thoughts were that the prison was not quite as horrible as I expected, but that is where Clavell did a good job allowing us to see the prison through the eyes of the prisoners. This was a really drmactic page turner for the specific reasons that there are so many levels of plot development and happenings.The two main characters are a British air officer named Marlowe and an American named the King. This book is of course about the psyche and human nature of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. When you read through the book you will think King is not so bad and doing what it takes to survive. By the end you will see the results of his behaviors, actions, and results. The last few pages are poetic and intense. I have read a lot of novels, and this one in my opinion is up there with the classics. Also King Rat could be read by people with all kinds of varying interests and enjoy it! My first Clavell read In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart. An unforgettable journey! Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve.... Autobiographical historical fiction at its best I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying \"The Brothers Karamazov\". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?

         "I really like the designs in this book - just as good if not better than the previous Adorable Knits (which I am also a fan of). I've knitted the Baby Snuggly and it turned out great, so I don't know what went wrong for the other reviewer. I know some of the patterns do have corrections to them but they're available from Hamlyn, the UK publisher (email info-ho@hamlyn.co.uk). fresh designs I bought this book after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that book. From this one I have made the teddy, the cloud pillow and am about 70% of the way through the kaleidoscope blanket (I decided that knitting 49 squares was too much like hard work and so adapted the pattern to be knit all in one go on a circular needle- its going well but maybe the squares would have been easier!). My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows. I plan to knit the star and moon blanket and the kitty cat jumper next. This is a lovely book with plenty of fabulous patterns. fun, funky patterns",

         "A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon is a lexical research tool for persons interested in the Hopi language. An effort has been made to include the most frequent forms of basic roots. The work is designed to serve as wide-ranging an audience as possible: Hopi speakers as well as those not fluent in this language, the scholar as well as the general reader. The lexicon treats the Third Mesa dialect and the vocabulary items are limited to items of common usage. The work is presented in two sections: the first and main section is Hopi-English and the second is an English-Hopi index. David Leedom Shaul Literary Criticism",
         "Concise is an understatement. I was looking to translate our Indian Princess names into Hopi, since we're the Hopi tribe, and I find that there are a lot of words missing. Take the word forest, I was looking for that, but could only find the word trunk(of a tree). I don't have the money for the full blown dictionary at $750 but thought the lexicon would see me through. It really hasn't and I have had to use different words to replace them. One tribe member is called Running Pheasant. There's no word for pheasant, so he has to be Horned Owl. I didn't expect the entire dictionary, but this is really too concise. Concise is an undersatement",
